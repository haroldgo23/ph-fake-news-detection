10,galing mismo kay  bbm na kasama siya sa nakawan ni senior  marcosmagnanakaw in   ferdinand marcos jr  went after lucio tan s wealth  claiming that the marcoses own   of the tycoon s fortune  here are excerpts from his testimony in the sandiganbayan  august     this shows that the son knew of the late father s source of ill gotten riches  marcos jr   i remember that at one point  i was summoned by my father to his office and he was there with mr  lucio tan in the discussion  and he told me that he would like me to familiarize myself with the operations of some of the enterprises that we have interests in and that mr  lucio tan was going to help me to be more familiar with the said operations  q  why did your father summon you to his office to familiarize yourself with the business interests of the marcoses  marcos jr  it was part of a larger effort on the part of the family to really clarify and to conduct an inventory and legal audit of all those business interests that we have  my sister  imee  who has the legal training  was given the job of conducting the legal audit  and i was given the job to go to as many of these enterprises as i could and as i said  learn the operations and meet the people who were running them so that when the time comes that we would take over  we would know how to manage these different interests  q  and what was the condition of your father when he summoned you to his office  marcos jr   when we first began this effort  he had me and my sister  we met and we sat down and he showed us some documents which are essentially deeds of assignment  shares of stock  titles to properties  and all these kinds of things  and he tried to give us a sketch of exactly how the structures were  and then his instructions to us were we go out and make sure that first  all documentations were in place because maybe the documents or something were in some persons to really reorganize them and collate everything we had several of those meetings and that was when i saw these documents  at the time  he was still quite strong  but then  he was starting to feel the effects of his kidney disease  perhaps  even that has a factor in his wanting us to know the family s interests  q  what happened after that meeting with your father and defendant lucio tan  marcos jr   at the end of the meeting  lucio tan and i talked and discussed the possibility of having a meeting  just the two of us  q  was there any occasion for your father to show proof of the family s interests in lucio tan  marcos jr  we have copies of some of them  but the originals were no longer with us  they are with the us magistrates of customs because these are the documents that we brought to hawaii and were taken by the americans  q  let us go back to the instance where you had substantial discussion with defendant lucio tan  where did it take place  marcos jr   the first time that we actually sat down and talked of anything substantive was in my father s office  subsequently  i received a message from mr  lucio tan s office that he would ask me to him at his office in allied bank  that is about a week or fortnight after i was summoned by my father  q  what did you discuss with him in that meeting  marcos jr  he laid out the ownership structure of the different corporations that we had interest in  q  did he tell you what those corporations are  marcos jr  yes  he actually drew out a diagram  a piece of paper  explaining that there was a company  shareholdings inc   which was a holding corporation for several other corporations  i will try to remember them all foremost farms  fortune tobacco  asia brewery  himmel industries  grandspan  dominion    and the ownership of shareholdings inc  was divided at least initially between three other companies  basic  supreme and falcon there are documents to show deeds of sale of shareholdings  inc  to the three companies this was relevant to us because we held the shares of stock in falcon and supreme which were with us  endorsed in blank   the last time i sat down with him  and talked to him was early   i remember that because i was in the middle of a campaign  and it was in the residence of the late louie tabuena  we were just having a conversation  and the tenor of mr  tan s comments were to express his anger at mr  rolly gapud  he kept saying  i don t like that rolly gapud because he is trying to say that i am a crony and i am not because i have never been part of this and that  q  what happened after that meeting  marcos jr  well  on the way out  one of his people gave me a check for a million pesos and said that is to help in my campaign  q  and what did you do with the check  marcos jr   i was very upset  i tore the check up to the disgust of my wife  q  what was the reaction to tat statement of defendant lucio tan  marcos jr  i was shocked for him to say such things because in our meetings and with discussions with my father i turned to him and said  you seem to have forgotten that many of the agreements and promises that have been made in the past   at which point the tension in the air was palpable  and there was not much conversation after that  ,1

12,  yellowtard rhetoric which big media almost exclusively broadcast and published in the  and  utterly dominated the airwaves and print media  there was no debate around what was or what wasn t  fake news    because there was no other way to disseminate news than via big media   back in the heyday decades of yellowtardism in the  and   mass communication was pretty much a one way street  the ability to efficiently reach a mass audience was a capitalist monopoly   held by those who possessed the means to organise enterprises that could build and operate what today are regarded as conventional broadcast and print facilities  television  radio  and newspapers   the only way ordinary people could put up a challenge to the vast information dissemination machine of big media was through conventional street level protest activism   rallies and pickets  distribution of leaflets and pamphlets  and  beginning in the mid  via text messaging and email forwarding  suffice to say  the might of big media utterly dwarfed pedestrian chatter  even the running of so called  mosquito presses  in the form of school publications and  underground newspapers  were as capital intensive and also prone to monopolisation by powerful interest groups  in the case of campus newspapers such as the university of the philippines  philippine collegian and others like it in other big schools  primarily leftist and communist elements    citizen journalism  may have existed before the term was concocted by today s social media beholden hipsters but its practitioners could neither compete with big media nor the  mosquito presses  monopolised by leftists and commies  thus it could be said that yellowtard rhetoric which big media almost exclusively broadcast and published in the  and  utterly dominated the airwaves and print media  there was no debate around what was or what wasn t  fake news    because there was no other way to disseminate news than via big media  and unlike today where  thanks to the internet and social media  ordinary people regard their ability to routinely challenge  news  and opinion distributed through big media outlets  as an entitlement and a right  back in the  and   big media  news  and opinion remained utterly unchallenged  in short  filipinos took it for granted that yellowtard ideology was authentic and correct because  well  it was the only ideology big media broadcast  indeed  even today  in the age of ubiquitous internet access  high social media penetration and usage  and  as a result of these  commoditised mass communication  the ascendancy of information disseminated via big media still remains difficult to challenge  we see this in the way philippine mainstream media has exerted its influence on the positions western corporate media and western non government organisations take on philippine political issues despite many of the assertions the industry makes about the government of philippine president rodrigo duterte being subject to debate and the object of wide dispute  indeed  it is quite telling that even in this day and age  the ability of an opaque organisation such as the catholic bishops conference of the philippines  cbcp    an organisation that refuses to subject itself and its doctrine to critical scrutiny   to disseminate not just dubious but downright incorrect information routinely goes unchallenged  in that sense  the liberal ideas and emotional rhetoric of yellowtards achieved its zenith at a time when ordinary people lacked the tools to directly challenge its wealthy purveyors  with the benefit of  century context  it is easy to see that the rise of yellowtard thinking happened on the back of the unfair advantage it enjoyed over competing ideas  it is no better than how catholicism spread   by the sword and by suppressing or overpowering competing ideas  the fact is  the only people and groups uncomfortable with and driven into a panic by the chaotic nature of today s internet fuelled discourse are those who have traditionally enjoyed the advantage in capital resources to reach a mass audience  that advantage may be gone today thanks to the internet  but evidently not gone is these people and groups  outsized sense of entitlement to monopolise the discourse  the notion of  fake news  applied to everything beyond the small subset that it is validly applicable to represents a strawman this entitled group put up to represent everything that threatens said entitlement  blocking dissent does not make dissent go away  all this does is blind you to the rise and spread of competing ideas and hasten your failure to respond to its spread effectively  facebook  for example  is now paying lip service to calls to crack down on  fake news   yet  just as nobody foresaw the rise of social media back in the early   nobody can foresee the unintended consequences of one organisation artificially throttling user behaviour over a massive network such as the internet within which it is a mere subset  who knows what next big  unforeseeable  thing will come up that will start to eat facebook s lunch  something out of the dark web  a new platform or protocol for connecting people or distributing ideas  nobody knows  you need to know your enemy to fight it  and  often  it takes courage and humility  and a reduced sense of entitlement to a monopoly on righteousness  to commit to getting to know your enemy and competing rather than just whining about the world being  unfair   ,1

19,icymi  lingayen archbishop soc villegas  holy week message was basically to warned the public to be wary of  unity  based on money  power blah  blah saying that virtuous unity must be based on humility  apparently a swipe at the message of unity of the bbm sara tandem  in that regard  mayor sara duterte s friend and san beda college of law classmate atty  bruce rivera can t help but comment on archbishop soc villegas  holy week message to the catholics because according to him  the ligayen archbishop  assertion is flawed for three reasons  right off the bat  atty  bruce told soc that unity is an act of state which is an act of god  remember the vox populi  vox dei saying  the voice of the people is the voice of god  the question is  when do you show unity  according to atty  bruce  unity is manifested when pinoys go to the polling centers to elect new sets of leaders to lead this nation  likewise  unity is also manifested by the voters of the losing candidate respecting the result of the election  as a catholic leader  atty  bruce said that the humility of accepting a leader you do not vote is the valued unity archbishop soc should be preaching  ouch  next  atty  bruce rebuffed archbishop soc s statement that unity based on political power  money etc is not true unity  this is not entirely true said atty  bruce  to achieve unity  you need political power and money  hence  archbishop soc is endorsing someone because he wants power  he could have chosen to stay neutral and not endorse a candidate to avoid dividing his flock but he chose the opposite because he wants to be influential  influence is power  but that depends if the people listens to him  otherwise  he will lose his credibility and his flock because of his sinful pride  as the bible says  money is the root of all evil and yet he is endorsing a candidate because he needs money  to gain power  you spend money  archbishop s candidate spends money to win an election  this makes his candidate the very person he is alluding not to support  you may now read atty  bruce s original fb post below  bakit mali si soc hindi sana ako magagalit ng biyernes santo pero pag gumagalaw ang demonyo  kailangan mong sabihin na mali siya  mali ka  bishop    una  unity is an act of state which is an act of god  vox dei  vox populi  so when do you show unity  it is during elections when the whole nation elect its leaders  and unity is manifested when the one chosen by the most number of filipinos lead this nation  but unity is also manifested by the voters of the losing candidate respecting the results of that election  the humility of accepting a leader who is not your choice is the valued unity you should be preaching  clearly  that is when true unity is achieved when you respect the choice of the people even when you have another candidate in mind  practice what you preach  huwag parinig using the pulpit because it reeks of hypocrisy like the pharisees who conspired to cause the death of jesus  second  you need political power  money to achieve unity  the reason you are endorsing a candidate is you want power  you can stay neutral and not divide the already dwindling parishioners but you go out of your way to be on the good graces of politician  why  because you want to be influential  influence is power  and you will only get influence if the people listen to you  and if they do not  you will lose the flock because of your own sinful pride  your lust for power is sad and contemptuous  and money is the root of all evil but you need money  everyone needs money  when you want power you spend money  which makes whoever you are supporting the same person you are saying not to support  third  when you call someone a criminal or attribute a criminal act  what is the duty of every catholic  to love even the enemy  to forgive those who have sinned against us and to do not do unto others what you do not do unto you  god never required an apology from the person  all he said is forgive  that was the lesson from the two other criminals in the cross  what did the crucifixion teach us  it taught us that not all criminals we crucify are criminals because we crucified the son of god so when we call someone a criminal or a sinner  we should condemn with jesus in mind  so we act with justice  and if we can forgive child molesters and return them to the flock because the law never convicted the abuser  how can you convict with your words  jesus is relevant even today because he is the epitome of the persecution of good and his death is vindication against hate and evil  practice what you preach  ,1

22,     no miracle is really needed to erase the stigma of being  a marcos  that bongbong bears  senator marcos simply needs to work harder and deliver more results   recall back to the twilight years of the presidency of former president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii  back then  aquino was so desperate to shore up the flagging political fortunes of his party that he would go as far as reminding filipinos to stop referring to the regime of former president ferdinand marcos as the philippines   golden age   this followed a realisation that was slow to come to his camp of the immense popularity of then vice presidential candidate ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr and the grave threat if posed to his dynasty  it didn t help aquino s liberal party at the time that no less than a new york times report asserted that filipinos yearn for a return to a similar golden age marked by a marcos back in malacanang  michelle pulumbarit    a customer service operator who lives north of manila  said mr  marcos was putting forward a proposal for the future that will bring back the best of the marcos years  she is not concerned about martial law and human rights violations  she said   for me  those are things of the past   she said   that was a time when our economy was booming  even imelda did a lot of good things  she shared our culture with the world  i can forgive her for having so many shoes    a key concern amongst anti marcos campaigners lies in what they regard as an  alarming  position taken by young filipinos who form a huge proportion of the philippines  pool of voters  most filipino  millenials  who were equipped primarily with anecdotal evidence of the martial law years had expressed a widespread disillusionment with the  democracy  pitched to them under the  edsa people power  flag  they only saw the absolute wretchedness of life in the philippines and took the position that things need to change   and that the closest model of how things should be in the philippines was a time when discipline and order ruled  apple buiza    an employee of a manila aluminum siding company  said the fate of imelda marcos s jewels was not a priority for her in the next election  ms  buiza spends hours each day battling traffic to get to work and is frustrated by the current government  she said she has heard stories of how orderly the country was during the marcos years   during the time of martial law  the philippines was disciplined   ms  buiza said as she gestured toward a group of jaywalkers dodging vehicles and blocking traffic   people don t even know how to cross the street now    it is now a widely held theory that the renewed   and surging   interest in the virtues of the martial law years of former president marcos and its regard as a  golden age  by some filipinos is a direct result of a lack of any progress realised over the  odd years that followed the   people power revolution  and  more specifically  over the six years of the second aquino administration  it could be said that the great democratic experiment of the philippines was marked more by a wholesale missing of the real point of freedom of an entire society and a series of governments that ruled since   instead of a stronger nation  what emerged after  years is a country characterised by a non existent fighting capability  mainstream media networks that dumb down rather than enlighten their audiences  and a people that lack a clear picture of what their long term future might look like  the trouble with aquino was that  as president  he focused most of his media time on vilifying his predecessor former president gloria macapagal arroyo  blaming  corruption  supposedly perpetrated by previous administrations  and waxing poetic about his parents   heroic  legacies  meanwhile  then senator bongbong marcos sustained a message to the public consistently themed on the future and moving towards it  back in early  in the days immediately following the massacre of  special action force  saf  troops by elements of the terrorist moro islamic liberation front  then senator marcos charted a crystal clear three point way forward out of the ensuing crisis that gripped the country in its aftermath  while the malacanang of then president aquino suffered an astounding paralysis and repeatedly stammered out mixed messages to the public as the much vaunted bangsamoro basic law  bbl  initiative was crushed under the public relations fallout from the massacre  marcos was in the field cobbling together consensus on how to proceed and assuring a bewildered filipino public that options were being explored  suffice to say  the manner with which marcos stepped up to the challenge while aquino and his entire cabinet descended into an orgy of internal bickering and incompetent statesmanship did not help at all  as is evident in the nyt report  filipinos long before then had already developed a healthy cynicism for the brand of  demo crazy  sold to them by the aquino cojuangco clan  even the whole notion that the aquinos and cojuangcos are symbols of the  spirit of edsa  is now being challenged  indeed  marcos worked hard to save the philippines from the clutches of the bangsamoro basic law  he had  in the process  demonstrated an ironic allegiance to the philippine constitution   a national charter that was crafted under the watch of no less than president bs aquino s mother  former president corazon  cory  aquino  as chief senate reviewer of the proposed bbl in   the junior marcos exhibited the sort of statesmanship and diplomacy that the original malacanang negotiating team led by secretary teresita quintos deles and miriam coronel ferrer utterly lacked  over the course of the review  senator marcos tirelessly travelled all over the country to consult with everyone potentially affected by the proposed law that would have seen a vast chunk of mindanao ceded unto the hands of the terrorist moro islamic liberation front  the outcome of the investigation was nothing short of conclusive  the bbl was unworkable and would have resulted in an outcome the opposite of what its authors promised the filipino people  despite these achievements  however  many filipinos continue to hate senator bongbong marcos  why  because of his surname  senator marcos s father was the late former president ferdinand e marcos  filipinos cannot seem to see past that fact  that is strange  because many of these people are the same people who are advocates of  voter education   a cornerstone of this initiative to develop an intelligent vote in the philippines is to change the way filipino voters evaluate candidates running for office  voter education champions encourage filipinos to ditch their traditional practice of voting on the basis of name  and face recall in favour of qualifications and record of achievement  yet  to his detractors  he is still and only just  a marcos   that s  quite simply  being small minded  then again  it makes sense of course  filipinos are predominantly roman catholic  catholics live by the baffling notion that babies are not born innocent  they believe babies are born guilty of original sin  to erase that  sin   no less than the son of god needed to be put up as human sacrifice to appease his own father  that explains the primitivist way filipinos continue to regard bongbong marcos  in filipinos  minds  bongbong is guilty of his father s alleged sins  so for arguments  sake  perhaps we should ask ourselves  what does bongbong marcos need to do to absolve himself of his father s sins  unlike the divine intervention needed to absolve catholic babies of their guilt  no miracle is really needed to erase the stigma of being  a marcos  that bongbong bears  senator marcos simply needs to work harder and deliver more results  and so far as we ve seen  he has demonstrated that stepping up to any challenge does not faze him at all  it s been almost four decades and the national narrative  as propagated by the powers that be  remains stuck in a bygone past   an age when ordinary people supposedly lacked today s much hyped technological capability to more effectively  spring  change from the grassroots  indeed  a people who lacked mobile technology and social media supposedly instigated a  revolution  over a three year period since ninoy aquino s assassination in   today   years since the internet became available to ordinary users and roughly  years since the dawn of social media  filipino  activists  have failed to step up to the promise of uplifting the quality of the way their compatriots participate in a democracy that aspires to join the modern world  perhaps it is time to regard our politicians using a different way of thinking  you see  it is only when filipinos become pro achievement first before being merely and only pro  that we can hold hand to heart and claim to be a real democracy ,1

26,president ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  seemed not to have made up his mind yet about the death penalty  saying it remains a sensitive topic that involves both practical and moral issues  marcos said this in his interview with one of his biggest supporters  tv host and actress toni gonzaga aired over alltv on his  birthday on september     according to the president  he was having a hard time taking a stand on the death penalty   the death penalty is a tough one because there is a practical issue and a moral issue involved   he said   and the question is  does society have the right to kill its own people  and that s a tough one to get around   he added  marcos likewise raised the question if bringing back the death penalty would actually work in discouraging crimes     as a practical matter  does the death penalty  actually  does it discourage people from committing heinous crimes  and i think the data  not only from the philippines but from other countries  shows that we have to be very stringent about applying the law   he said  marcos  predecessor  former president rodrigo duterte  never missed calling on congress to bring back the death penalty after it was scrapped twice since the creation of the  constitution  congress  however  did not deliver on duterte s call  the  constitution allows congress to bring back capital punishment for heinous crimes  it was revived during the ramos administration but was scrapped again under the arroyo administration  under the duterte administration  the house majority bloc voted to exclude plunder  rape  and treason from the list of crimes punishable with death  the exclusion is supposed to help them arrive at a compromise after some lawmakers remained hesitant about voting in favor of house bill no      in   president duterte wondered why congress decided to exclude plunder and rape from the list of crimes punishable by death under the said house bill  duterte said that while he did not say he would not kill plunderers or corrupt officials  rape is still one of the most heinous crimes that should merit the heaviest penalty  malacañang had said that the reimposition of capital punishment is an important component in maintaining a crime free and drug free philippines   ,0

32,the bbm dilemma  between kid gloves and iron hand  part  of     every head of state has two sources of legitimacy  internal and external  to remain effective  a head of state must build and sustain both types of legitimacy and become aware of how they affect each other  a leader s dwindling internal legitimacy certainly can easily destroy their external legitimacy  though often ignored  the reverse is also true  a deteriorating external legitimacy can also diminish one s internal legitimacy  leaders often pay less attention to external legitimacy to devastating results    internal legitimacy depends on the trust and confidence citizens have on their leaders  external legitimacy comes from the recognition from other heads of states  multilateral organisations  international civil society organisations  and global public opinion     for now  president bongbong marcos   pbbm  internal legitimacy is quite solid  elected with    with an overwhelming margin of about  million votes  pbbm s external legitimacy still needs to be built  no head of state has condemned pbbm   that s good news  in this part  i am going to analyse the threats and opportunities to the internal legitimacy of pbbm  the second part will be about threats and opportunity to his external legitimacy    pbbm s situation is a bit difficult  during the elections  pbbm just needs to set himself apart from leni robredo  which is quite easy because leni s campaign was so disastrous  but as president  he bears the double brunt of being compared to his father and pbbm s predecessor  prrd  during the elections  the key question is how to win  but once elected  the key question becomes how to govern    pbbm won on the basis of the  narrative of continuity   his political base can be generally divided into two groups  the marcos loyalists and the duterte supporters  for the marcos loyalists  they want the son to continue what the father started  for the duterte supporters  they want pbbm to continue what prrd started  but of course  no leader can just be a facsimile of somebody else  the leader then has to wrestle successfully with this question to remain effective  what to continue and what to change    both fem and rrd were very strong leaders who didn t hesitate to rule with an iron hand  pbbm s dilemma is whether to continue this or change his approach to governance  the question then is how far will you let the pendulum swing to the other extreme  the two extremes are  to govern with kid gloves or to govern with an iron hand     when pnp chief azurin issued that statement that was perceived as being gentle towards criminals  the public felt the pendulum swing from the iron hand to kid gloves  obviously  the buck stops at the president s desk  thus the policy can easily be associated as the president s policy prescription  pbbm has already projected and maintained an image of being benevolent  this is good because it disassociates him from the authoritarianism associated with his father and his predecessor  but this comes with the disadvantage of being perceived as a weak leader  and in politics  perception is everything    in the prince  machiavelli reflected on fear and love  and their relevance on statecraft  machiavelli s central question is  whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved   the popular interpretation reduced the complexity of machiavelli s answer to this  it is better to be feared than love  however  machiavelli s advice is more nuanced     one should wish to be both    machiavelli said  however   it is difficult to unite them in one person  it is much safer to be feared than love   machiavelli set apart two kinds of relationships of a leader  one  is transactional   i scrub your back  you scrub mine    the other is those obtained by  greatness or nobility of mind    transactional relationships are not secured  as machiavelli said  these types of relationships  cannot be relied upon   and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared  for love is preserved by the link of obligation which  owing to the baseness of men  is broken at every opportunity for their advantage  but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails     furthermore  machiavelli cautions any leader to incite fear in such a way that if fear doesn t win him love  he at least avoids being hated  this means that the goal of fear is to earn respect  a commanding presence that thomas hobbes once characterised as the presence that could put people  in awe     pbbm has successfully made himself loved  the question is has he made them fear him  the in fighting in his administration that keeps dragging on isn t doing pbbm any service  this is producing a perception that he cannot put his own house in order  where is the man of the house that could put all these warring factions in awe  and if it were true that atty  vic rodriguez wanted so much power for himself  the question that inevitably comes next is  why is atty  rodriguez so brazen in doing that in the first place  doesn t he fear the president who was elected by a a majority    in chinese political thought  there are two ideals of statecraft  the confucian ideal of  human leader  and the chinese legalist ideal of the  enlightened leader   the enlightened ruler is more akin to the machiavellian archetype but cautions the leader from being a despot who is a slave to his whims  in the world of thought in ancient china  benjamin i  schwartz emphasised this feature of the enlightened leader   he must at all times be able to maintain an iron wall between his private life and public role  concubines  friends  flatterers and charismatic saints must have no influence whatsoever on the course of policy  and he must never relax his suspicions of the motives of those who surround him      maintaining an  iron wall  between his private life and public role should be emphasised here  the images of partying  relaxing  and having a good time are aspects of his private that must be kept away from public view as it can and will be used to erode his internal legitimacy     the contemporary archetype of the enlightened leader is lee kuan yew   both beloved and feared  lee kuan yew could put his house in order and instil discipline in the bureaucratic structure of singapore s government   and what s also good about lee kuan yew is he has the advantage of being a leader that the west could warm up to because he is  of course  british educated and spoke and acted in a manner that doesn t appear too foreign to the west  this aspect is something that pbbm is already doing well  which i will discuss in the second part   but what our beloved leader needs to find is that ground between ruling with kid gloves and iron hand  one that fuses his naturally benevolent character with the imperative of statecraft of instilling fear in such a way that won t make people hate him  benevolence must be matched with a commanding presence that could put them all in awe   ,1

38,  when the  families of the  philippine police special action force officers  ask me about progress being made delivering promised justice for them  i have nothing to report  i feel  personal shame because of that   it is not often that we see politicians making statements in solidarity with the philippine government overall  as opposed to solidarity limited along partisan lines at best   a tweet fielded by senator bongbong marcos today demonstrates this sort of winning attitude   pag tinatanong ako ng pamilya ng    ano na ang nangyari sa hustisya na pinangako   wala akong masagot  nahihiya ako   translated   when the  families of the  philippine police special action force officers  ask me about progress being made delivering promised justice for them  i have nothing to report  i feel  personal shame because of that   by saying that  marcos is essentially owning up to government s overall responsibilities to its people  it is a good model of statesmanship   openly expressing his willingness to be one with the national government that he is part of in being accountable for its inability to meet the public s expectations of it  no ifs or buts and no blaming predecessors or other parties  indeed  as far as filipinos are concerned  senator marcos is part of their government  to that expectation  he steps up  the prime suspects involved in the cold blooded massacre of these police officers early this year  allegedly elements of the terrorist moro islamic liberation front  have yet to be apprehended  for that matter  there are no updates on or any evidence of on going pursuit efforts  in short  it is safe to assume that the philippine government is not mounting any action at all to apply the full force of the law towards bringing these criminals to justice  nor is the moro islamic liberation front leadership exhibiting any interest in achieving the same outcome  for a politician to categorically state that the failure of his government is his own personal failure is ground breaking indeed  the philippines  after all  is blame game and mudslinging country   specially during election campaign season  it takes a special breed of politician not seen in recent years to rise beyond the dismal quality of today s political discourse in the philippines  unfortunately  for filipinos  marcos is an infinitesimal exception to the rule  filipino politicians are simply unable to measure up to the rare statesmanship that was once in abundance in the bygone early days  no less than president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii has institutionalised blame politics and brand partisanship in the philippines over the last five years of his rule  effectively colouring his entire administration with the relentless demonisation of his predecessor  former president gloria arroyo  and embedding his politics of exclusion by monomanically sticking to his partisan yellow colour instead of wearing the true national colours and behaving like a real head of state  filipinos have forgotten what true statesmanship is like thanks to decades of being subject to the bs of one bozo after another  tragic  statesmanship is really fundamentally just all about being and speaking like a gentleman  it is not hard  you just need to be an honourable person in word and deed who takes the responsibilities of his job seriously by regarding himself as being accountable for the performance of the larger organisation he represents ,1

50,  but while the statement described this  red baiting  as  disinformation   nowhere in the statement does ibon categorically deny badoy s allegations   that they as well as other  progressive  organisations are really just  legal  fronts of the cpp npa   news has now gotten around that communist front ibon foundation filed an administrative complaint against presidential communications operations office  pcoo  undersecretary lorraine badoy among others  ibon foundation reportedly claim that badoy engaged in  red tagging   presumably  the complaint draws partly from a video showing badoy allegedly  hijacking  the agenda of a talk show that included ibon research head rosario guzman  a statement released by ibon foundation on the  january following the incident condemned badoy for  linking ibon to the communist party of the philippines new people s army national democratic front of the philippines  cpp npa ndfp   consistent to what was observed in the video  but while the statement described this so called  red baiting  as  disinformation   nowhere in the statement does ibon categorically deny badoy s allegations   that they as well as other  progressive  organisations are really just  legal  fronts of the communist party of the philippines and its terrorist arm  the new people s army  npa   indeed  the closest the ibon statement gets to some semblance of a counterargument against the  red tagging  charge is this   ibon has been explaining economic issues to the public for  years  the duterte administration is attacking ibon because we advocate an economy that upholds the people s interests most of all  as with activists and other groups  we are undeterred and will continue to support the efforts of the people s movement to reclaim the economy from the elites that have taken it over   in short  ibon not only cannot deny their alleged links to the communist party of the philippines  they cannot even assert that badoy is making a false claim about those links  if you examine the statement closely  what ibon does suggest is that philippine president rodrigo duterte is against building  an economy that upholds the people s interests  and is  as such  attacking ibon   it seems it is ibon  in this instance  that is making an unfounded assertion  they will need to prove that the duterte administration is implementing an economic policy that runs counter to the interests of the filipino people to clear the air around this so they could move forward with their complaint against badoy  if said complaint holds water  that is   it is interesting how the current opposition  its lackeys in big corporate media  and its circle of so called  activists  dishonestly water down the nature of the cpp npa as terrorists and enemies of the state  they denounce  red tagging  of leftist groups as a  ploy  perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups  however there has been no categorical denial of links between the cpp npa and these so called  leftist  groups coming from any of their leaders  a stanford university report on militant organisations  for example  describes current party list group bayan muna  a key stakeholder in the ibon foundation  as  a political party connected to the cpp and other groups in the communist movement   according to a recent abs cbn news report bayan muna is part of the makaybayan bloc of left leaning party lists that include  gabriela  kabataan  anakpawis  migrante  and alliance of concerned teachers   like most other mainstream reports and discussion surrounding these  leftist  organisations  the report stops short of describing these groups as being linked to the cpp and the terrorist npa  it just takes just a little bit of research or observation over readily accessible sources like social media and even old news reports to see that familiar names  organisations  and slogans are common across all the militant groups mentioned thus far  bayan muna and ibon foundation  in fact  often get mentioned in the same paragraph in many such news reports  dig a bit deeper and you will find the personalities who lead or are  at least  involved with these groups sharing the same social networks  the short of it is  these groups insult the intelligence of filipinos by continuing to pretend that they are not communists  if ibon foundation and other communist front organisation are to be taken seriously about their whining about being  red tagged   perhaps they need to reflect on their own banal dishonesty first and  following that  get real and start making more truthful statements about themselves  their activities  and their true intentions ,1

53,  whatever industries filipinos and chinese filipino industrialists put up  shut down during the post marcos period because of labor unrest triggered by leftist militant groups identified with the communist party  its terrorist arm the new people s army     i keep wondering why everything that is wrong with this country is blamed on former president ferdinand marcos and current president rodrigo duterte and not the political bloc that was in power for thirty years since   marcos was in power for twenty one  duterte six  that s a total of twenty seven  you don t need to have a phd in any discipline to analyze what went wrong with the philippine economy  you just need to read history and analyze the political structure  yet here is philstar columnist andrew masigan in his piece  clarity of need and strength of intention  telling us that  the philippines is asia s sick man again after electing a chief executive who thought that illegal drugs was our most pressing development barrier    the tragedy is that the duterte administration failed to sustain the national industrial strategy  the manufacturing sector eroded since   decelerating to   percent in  and   percent in  until it collapsed during the pandemic  contracting by    percent  instead of further developing local industries to generate jobs  exports and wealth  this government relied on infrastructure spending  and other types of spending  to drive economic growth  it was the wrong prescription   marasigan should recall the philippines  economic history  the spanish and american periods saw the philippines producing coconut oil  abaca and sugar  these were the main exports  manila then was the pearl of the orient  a trading outpost similar to hong kong with a large expatriate community of europeans and americans  it was a plantation style economy which was nothing but a modern version of fief and serf in medieval europe  the monarchy was the catholic church  what was not manufactured was imported  was there an economic policy in place by the commonwealth government  none  that was dictated by the american colonial masters  after world war ii  the americans upped and left  but they retained parity rights for their businesses and kept their military bases  then as now  economic activities were concentrated in luzon  visayan and mindanao housed the large plantations  politicians and the oligarchs were busy rebuilding the wealth they lost during the war  pre war  the philippines had no manufacturing sector  post war  it was the chinese who set up shop to churn out was viable to be produced locally  the only time an economic and infrastructure development plan was in place was after ferdinand marcos was elected  post war  the country had to deal with a communist insurgency  by the time the  rolled in  it was back  then there was the muslim separatist rebellion  both of these were instigated by the late former senator ninoy aquino  marcos declared martial law and put forth an economic development policy anchored by the new society   ang bagong lipunan  why did marcos fail  oil price shocks in  and  and the fact that the only lender of development funds was the international monetary fund and the world bank  imf wb  which was an american controlled institution  it didn t help that by   the us wanted marcos out for not renewing their parity rights and shortening the us military bases agreement shortly thereafter  cory aquino s tumultuous administration was wracked by political instability  labor unrest and military adventurism  fidel ramos  who succeeded her  was able to restore a semblance of order  philippines  was his vision but it was rudely cut short by the asian financial crisis of   following him was joseph  erap  estrada who was ousted by the ruling power bloc despite the overwhelming support of the masses which catapulted him to the presidency  it again fell on gloria macapagal arroyo  gma  to restore order which she did  despite the fact that she was a party to the instability to begin with  we all know what happened in recent history  think about it  there wasn t enough monies in the economy in the  that the cojuangco clan had to borrow money from manufacturers hanover bank to purchase hacienda luisita from tabacalera  whatever industries filipinos and chinese filipino industrialists put up  shut down during the post marcos period because of labor unrest triggered by leftist militant groups identified with the communist party  its terrorist arm the new people s army  and its  legal  front the national democratic front  cpp npa ndf   how can the economy grow when there is no power supply  after that came the high cost of power  all of the marcos development plans were thrown in the garbage can  no investment in infrastructure projects  whatever projects were there was controlled by the oligarchs  even if foreign investors wanted to come in  they were precluded by the constitutional limitations on business ownership  this is why our economy is consumption driven  demand is fuelled by overseas filipino worker  ofw  remittances and business process outsourcing  bpo  operations  we don t export agricultural commodities because our packaging industry isn t as modern as our asean neighbors  it was only recently that a petrochemical plant was established but its output is still short for the demand  its convenient for people like masigan to lay the blame on marcos and duterte when this is farthest from the truth  he should stick to selling popcorn which his family imports  that s where they made their money  popperoo  might as well be pooperoo given the crap he comes up with with his economic  analysis  ,1

114,  every time bs aquino mentions the name marcos  the voters unconsciously give the senator s performance as a public servant a second look and they begin to see him as his own man  separately from his father   why has senator and vice presidential candidate bongbong marcos become so popular with filipino voters  there are plenty of reasons why but the number one reason is because of his number one critic  current president benigno simeon aquino  a lot of voters have become disillusioned by bs aquino s performance over the six years he s held office  they realize that he is quite an unpleasant man who is only good at blaming other people for his own failures  his character is such a turn off  it doesn t help that he doesn t have a face that could launch a thousand ships  it is a cringe worthy experience watching the president speak in public  it s hard to tell if it is because of the shape of his mouth  which looks like it is always upside down or because his mouth is always spewing negative things about other people  either way  bs aquino is just so uninspiring  he has never been one to inspire unity in philippine society anyway  in fact  his speeches are quite often about how  evil  his rivals are compared to him  people have noticed how hypocritical he is by casting himself as pious while throwing negative propaganda against his political enemies  a truly pious person will never speak ill of others  because marcos  jr is a threat to the so called aquino  legacy   bs aquino has shifted to full gear in trying to knock the senator s popularity down  bs aquino  the son of the late  democracy icon  and former president cory aquino would be a laughing stock indeed  when the marcoses return to malacanang  ironically  the more bs aquino talks negatively about the marcoses  the more people give marcos jr a second look  it appears that bs aquino and his supporters do not understand the concept behind public relations  they inadvertently help give marcos jr free publicity at the height of campaign season for the presidential elections  as they say  all publicity is good publicity  this brings us to another reason why marcos jr has become popular with voters  every time bs aquino mentions the name marcos  the voters unconsciously give the senator s performance as a public servant a second look and they begin to see him as his own man  separately from his father  the problem with bs aquino and his supporters is that  it has become obvious that the only things they can use against marcos jr are the atrocities allegedly committed by his father s government during the martial law years and nothing about his performance as a senator  they keep insisting that marcos jr has not apologized for them  but martial law was declared when he was only  years old  how can they blame the atrocities committed by members of the philippine military and police on someone who was still a teenager when they occurred  some people are suffering from a bad case of tunnel vision that they can t think straight anymore  on one occasion  bs aquino criticized marcos jr for dyeing his gray hair black  only a bald man would notice another man s hairdo  i suppose  bs aquino s hypocrisy was made more evident when he hosted the japanese emperor and empress recently  during world war ii  the japanese imperial army committed worse atrocities against the filipino people and yet bs aquino recently welcomed the emperor akihito and empress michiko in the country  while bs aquino sees the importance of making peace with one of the country s previous oppressors  he doesn t see the importance of making peace with the marcoses  he talks about them as if they did nothing good for the country  this despite the fact that a lot of the infrastructure built during the marcos years like the philippine international convention center  the north and south luzon tollways  the philippine heart center  and the san juanico bridge among others are still being utilized by filipinos today  we also need not mention some of the policies initiated by marcos sr like sending overseas contract workers abroad to help the economy still benefit even the bs aquino administration today  yes  those are some of the things that give voters something to think about  unfortunately for bs aquino  the more he highlights how bad the marcoses are  the more he highlights that he is worse than his enemies  this brings us to yet another reason why marcos jr is becoming popular  despite the negative propaganda thrown at him  marcos jr still manages to smile and take things with a grain of salt  the voters notice this and find him a refreshing alternative to the hostile demeanor bs aquino quite often projects  indeed  what the philippines needs is a leader who will promote unity and harmony among filipinos and not someone who promotes discord and division like bs aquino  the voters have had enough of him and his despicable personality ,1

116,pbbm   a foreign policy owl the recent events are replete with diplomatic symbolisms  pay attention  as we just had a masterclass in diplomacy  every architect of foreign policy has a certain leadership posture  one can be a hawk  a hardliner  a foreign policy leader that s confrontational and provocative  or one can be a dove   a foreign policy leader who shies away from confrontation and goes to the length of avoiding anything that can provoke  between the two is the owl  who judiciously combines the two to achieve what every foreign policy is designed to achieve  to maximise gains  and minimise losses in a country s relation with other nations  when he was still a candidate  president bongbong marcos often referred to a  fine line  foreign policy he intends to pursue  that s not the direction of hawks and doves  but of foreign policy owls  two recent scenarios demonstrates pbbm s predilection to be a foreign policy owl   first  the visit of u s  vice president kamala harris in the philippines was handled well by the bbm administration  enough to make china issue a very restraint reaction  whoever thought of vp kamala harris only being transported by brp teresa magbanua  a patrol vessel of the philippine coast guard  should be applauded as it s a masterstroke in diplomacy  certainly  pbbm took part in the decision  the philippine coast guard is not a military force  it is under the civilian authority of the department of transportation and communication  a civilian force being at the spotlight of vp kamala harris  visit sends a message that the philippines is civilianising rather than militarising its pursuit of interests in the south china sea  this greatly helped avoiding a rise in diplomatic temperature that could have had happened if vp kamala harris were aboard a philippine warship  the provenance of brp teresa magbanua is also worth noting  first  the philippines  under the duterte administration  purchased it from japan through a japan international cooperation agency  jica  loan  it s not a hand me down from the united states but acquired through our own efforts  the symbolism  independence rather than mendicancy  second  the name of the ship   teresa magbanua   who is she  magbanua is a filipino hero  her heroism is exemplary as she s just one of the few filipinos who fought the spanish  american  and japanese colonialism  it s quite amusing that vp kamala harris was aboard a ship named after someone who fought against her country s imperialism  while vp kamala harris cajoled our coast guards as the frontliners of freedom of the seas  she was transported by teresa magbanua  a filipino frontline in the fight against the illegal and illegitimate u s  occupation of the philippines  second  pbbm s answer to the question of a dzrh correspondent issue of the chinese coast guards  seized  a debris of a space rocket that was floating near pag asa island   what would be your directive regarding this   pbbm confirmed that he would heed nsa clarita carlos suggestion of sending a note verbal to china regarding the incident   let me quote the rest of what pbbm said as it was such a beautifully crafted answer   when it was first reported to me by the chief of staff  i asked him to immediately call the military attache in the chinese embassy and to get a report  hindi nagtugma ang report ng philippine navy at ng report na nanggaling sa china because the word  forcibly  was used  the philippine navy report and that is not the characterisation in the report coming from china    so we have to resolve this issue   he added   of course i have complete trust in our navy and if this is what they say happened  i can only believe that is what happened  so  we now have to ask the chinese why is it their account is so different and much more benign i m glad that i m going to beijing in early january because this is one of the things we need to work out with the way the region  our region  is heating up  baka may magkamali lang eh  mistake  may misunderstanding then lalaki yung sunog so we don t want that to happen  we want to have a mechanism  we have to find a way na hindi na mangyari yung mga incident na ganyan   no bellicosity  yet firm  that s what pbbm is in this statement  which reveals his foreign policy owl orientation  graham allison  albert carnesale  and joseph nye describe foreign policy owls as those who are cautious about  events getting out of control  history is full of cases where rational decision makers were tripped up by non rational factors  with disastrous results    while standing behind the report of our navy  pbbm didn t take the opportunity to be bellicose but approached the issue levelheadedly  his direction is conflict de escalation and problem solving rather than demonising  his goal is simple  avoid the repeat of the incident  pbbm is taking us to an elegant way of conducting foreign policy  one in which sobriety rules  and where megaphone diplomacy gives way to a more gracious handling of conflict  pbbm handled the issue with finesse  and china should reciprocate in kind   ,1

119,hmmm  how nice  this actress called andrea seems to be enjoying her share of fame on social media  i ve been reading her tweets and stuff that make it to my feed   my impression is that her new found fame is in how she parries the petty attacks on her previous statements in relation to the dismal loss of mrs  robredo  she is clearly dismayed and is lashing out at just about anyone who voted against her candidate  but  to me  she is becoming famous for how empty her mind is about the things she says online  and this  i think  is why people keep bugging her  and she keeps answering them  the more she replies  the more of her blankness is shown  and she doesn t know this  or maybe she does  this is cruel  not a good thing to be publicly amused about  but the only way to stop this cruelty is for this andrea character to  maybe  stop enabling her petty attackers  after all  stupidity might not be funny  but a person who is so clueless of one s own stupidity is kinda amusing   but who am i to say she doesn t like it    ,1

127,  robredo and her camp are very quiet about the woman troll who threatened to  plant  bombs during a pro duterte rally and who also planned to assassinate duterte if the impeachment bid against him doesn t succeed   women who use the woman card   the act of claiming they are being victimised because of their gender   so liberally are disappointing and do not help advance the real issues rational women are fighting for  one woman who quite often use the woman card is current vice president leni robredo  she claims that today s world is not safe for women anymore   attacks and harassment on social media  including threats of rape and bodily harm  are just as painful as attacks in real life  but on social media  we are a lot more vulnerable  safety and protection are a lot more difficult to find in the digital arena   while i don t condone  threats of rape and bodily harm   robredo made it sound like it was only women who receive violent threats online  there are actually men from the pro duterte supporters who have received death threats from rabid liberal party supporters  one person who was publicly threatened on facebook was public prosecutor darwin cañete  someone threatened to enter cañete s home and massacre his whole family recently  the troll even posted cañete s home address for everyone to see and yet cañete did not cry foul and claim to be a victim of gender inequality  he just went straight to the process of prosecuting the troll who made the threats  that is not something we can say about robredo  it seems all she does is complain about her critics online and cry foul that she is being unfairly persecuted  never mind that she produced a video persecuting president rodrigo duterte and the members of the philippine national police for the world see in the hope that the european union and united nations would do something to topple the current government  robredo did not realise that there are also women in the police force and by maligning the agency  she inadvertently put everyone  including the female officers  in a bad light  there are women and men who work tirelessly and quietly  but robredo lumped them all with the others who are supposedly rotting the system  it seems both men and women are not safe against robredo s speculative and reckless remarks  what s unfair about this sorry situation is robredo is the one crying foul after she received backlash from the public after she painted a very bad picture of the philippines to the international community  she made it look like the country has become the wild  wild west   where people cannot walk the streets safely anymore  her picture is far from the result of the latest survey that found that   of filipinos feel safer with the ongoing duterte government s war on drugs  speaking of trolls  robredo and her camp are very quiet about the woman troll who threatened to  plant  bombs during a pro duterte rally and who also planned to assassinate duterte if the impeachment bid against him doesn t succeed    lyn ouvrier threatened to bomb the luneta on april   and swore to plot the assassination of president rodrigo duterte in the event that the impeachment complaint against him does not prosper  she thought she could get away with this  she is dead wrong  lyn ouvrier is not her true name  it is an alias that she uses as she inflicts her vitriol on duterte supporters  lyn is also a certified leni troll  in fact  she is even willing to commit a crime in her name  after all  only a loyal and committed follower would publicly state this in facebook   we are going to plant bombs at the luneta park on april    in order to protect the vice president and disrupt the rally to be organized by fanatics of duterte   it is strange that she can label supporters of the president as fanatics  without thinking that only fanatics would plant bombs in a rally to protect a public figure  in fact  people who would do so are not just fanatics  but are also terrorists   a woman terrorist is not good for women s image  indeed  robredo should be outraged  it shouldn t matter that the troll is her supporter  what matters is robredo should help fast track her prosecution because the troll is willing to murder people for her ideology  while robredo is claiming that women are not safe in today s world anymore  the truth is  filipinos are not safe while robredo is in power because she is using her position to destabilise the philippines and she is inspiring her supporters to harm innocent people  during a radio interview with commentator ted failon  robredo admitted that she asked herself  what have i gotten myself into   damn the public including her supporters should ask her why she ran for the vice presidency in the first place if she didn t know what she was getting herself into  did she think it was going to be peachy being in the second most powerful position in the land  did she expect everyone to agree with her views all the time  she must have been in a daze when she was campaigning   intoxicated by all the attention from the liberal party supporters who deluded themselves into believing she was the second cory aquino  if only robredo listened to her own daughters who begged her not to run for vice president  they had more wisdom than her to foresee  in that instance  they would be embroiled in the bitterness of politics the higher up the food chain you go  in her attempts to blame others for her current woes  robredo also admitted in the same interview with failon that she sometimes blames her dead husband  former department of interior and local government undersecretary jesse robredo  for the situation she is in  she said that if he hadn t died  she would never have entered politics  she inadvertently admitted that her motivation is not to serve the people  but to continue the so called  legacy  of her late husband  and you might ask  what legacy  there are people close to the robredos who are coming out now saying that jesse wasn t as squeaky clean as his supporters claim him to be  but these are all loose talk by people who want to remain anonymous online  you also wonder why they didn t come out with the  truth  prior to the election  that could have helped bring down robredo to earth  instead  we have to deal with a vice president who is so delusional to think that she is the answer to the philippines  problems  in another speech during the belle du jour women s summit  robredo encouraged women to  speak the truth all the time   she should follow her own advice and stop lying to the people  she should start backing her claims with facts and stop denying her own statements when critics are calling her out for spreading false information  it is kinda depressing to watch leni speak in public  she lacks charisma and wisdom  it s hard to imagine how she got the vp post without foul play and it s even harder to imagine her as the president just in case  the only thing going for her is her skill at playing the woman victim card  the fact is  robredo is adding to the division in philippine society  after releasing unsubstantiated claims  she would then spend a lot of time defending herself from critics like the time she denied that she said there were more than   victims of extra judicial killings due to the war on drugs  which contradicts the pnp s much lower figure of over    robredo also insisted that she wrote a letter to the dilg and the pnp asking about the palit ulo scheme   a letter that pnp chief ronald  bato  dela rosa denies he had received  the letter she showed the public did not even state she was inquiring about the palit ulo scheme  instead of apologising for her errors  robredo stubbornly sticks to her guns and denies them even when what she said was on record  it goes to show that she is more concerned about her image and her ego than serving the people  this is not just bad for the women she claims to represent  it is bad for the entire population of the philippines ,1

155,former president rodrigo duterte already has a plan to block any attempt by the international criminal court  icc  to arrest him  even before the government has responded to a proposed resumption of the investigation of the charges of crimes against humanity against him by the tribunal prosecutor  his former spokesperson said on tuesday  harry roque  who disclosed on tuesday that he was now counsel to duterte in the icc case  said that the ex president would  never  cooperate with  foreign courts  in trying him for any crime     he also said   and actually this idea came from him   that if  for any reason  the icc will continue to exercise its jurisdiction  he will go before philippine courts for a restraining order to restrain the philippine police from serving the warrant of arrest against him   roque said in an interview with anc  duterte will argue that philippine courts are  able and willing  to prosecute cases against him and there was no basis for  foreign institutions  to interfere with the country s judicial system  he said  option for victims  kin international law professor romel bagares said families of the victims of the bloody drug war had a legal remedy against such a move by duterte  who has returned to davao city where he served two decades as mayor before he was elected president in    supposing mr  duterte secures a tro  from a davao regional trial court  other parties   like the victims or any other interested parties   can then appeal before the supreme court   he said  bagares acknowledged that the decision of president ferdinand marcos jr  not to rejoin the icc would make it difficult for the court to proceed to trial  even if the icc pre trial chamber  ptc  issues warrants against duterte   who would enforce the arrest warrants without the philippine government s cooperation   he asked   the summonses are of no effect if the suspects also do not recognize the icc procedures   he said  but bagares noted that the icc had proven that it was still able to arrest suspects with the help of  international instruments   marcos position marcos said on monday the philippines would not rejoin the icc because local investigators were already doing a probe of the drug war  so there was no need for the icc to do that    duterte withdrew the philippines from the icc in march  after its prosecutor then  fatou bensouda  opened a preliminary examination of the charges against him and several other officials of his administration  including then national police chief ronald dela rosa  who is now a senator  roque said people who have  gripes  against duterte  should file complaints before a philippine court and if there is probable cause he is willing to face them  but before a philippine court   in june  icc prosecutor karim khan proposed to resume the investigation of the thousands of brutal drug war killings after it was suspended late last year upon the request of the former administration  the icc ptc requested the government and the complainants who filed the charges against the former president to comment on khan s proposal by sept    justice secretary jesus crispin remulla said the department of justice  doj  was willing to provide the icc with a report of its investigation of abuses in the conduct of the drug war started by his predecessor  menardo guevarra  who is now the solicitor general   we will furnish them the available information as a matter of comity   remulla told reporters on tuesday  he was in favor guevarra said the government s legal team had arrived at  a general consensus on how to handle the icc case   but the office of the president  doj  the department of foreign affairs  and the office of the chief presidential legal counsel were still studying  the mechanics for implementing their agreed course of action   on aug      then senator marcos and  of his colleagues voted in favor of senate resolution no   to ratify the rome statute  the treaty that established the icc  in support of then president benigno aquino iii s decision for the philippines to join the icc  in a facebook post on tuesday  ruben carranza  who had served as a member of the presidential commission on good government  noted that marcos was reversing course   the same one who won t rejoin the icc voted to join the icc in  because  its   ratification signifies philippine commitment to human rights and is our contribution to an effective international criminal justice system    carranza said  quoting a part of the senate resolution   seven of the  senators who approved the resolution are still serving in the chamber  loren legarda  francis escudero  lito lapid  ramon revilla jr   jinggoy estrada  pia cayetano and alan peter cayetano  dela rosa   i m happy  dela rosa  who led the brutal war on drugs  was grateful for the decision not to rejoin the icc   i must admit it  being the  no   accused   i am happy   dela rosa told reporters  then senate president juan ponce enrile  who is now the president s chief legal counsel  was the only senator who voted against the resolution  the  year old said joining the icc might hamper soldiers in carrying out their duties and might also  expose philippine presidents to all kinds of suits where they will have to spend their own money  personal fortunes to defend themselves and the worries that accompany them while they await the verdict  which is outside our normal forum   senate majority leader joel villanueva said he disagreed with mr  marcos and said  it would be better  that the senators speak with the president  to share our sentiments   roque said duterte was confident that mr  marcos  will do everything  to prove to the icc that it should not exercise jurisdiction over the former president  roque was one of the founding members and former chair of the center for international law  an organization of lawyers that pushed the philippines to ratify the rome statute   ,0

210,  leni robredo has abused that tolerance by being a party to to groups and communities directly engaged in the planning and instigation of activities meant to destabilise and  eventually  overthrow the government of president rodrigo duterte   this is the latest  statement  from  vice president  leni robredo related to the recent reorganisation of the senate that resulted in certain liberal party  lp  senators being relieved of their committee chairmanships   when we were given the mandate by the people  we were determined to work with this administration to put national interest before politics  but despite our sincere efforts  it is now clear that the duterte administration is incapable of tolerating dissent  no matter how constructive   and here is why the efforts of the  vice president  to make sense in this latest statement failed on three counts      national interest before politics  this is  of course  coming from robredo who presumably represents the interests of the lp  the lp  if we recall  primarily characterised its representation to the filipino people with the use of the colour yellow across all of its branding paraphernalia  no less than former president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii preferred to wear a yellow ribbon to symbolise his national leadership  if the lp was really serious about that focus on nation rather than on politics that robredo talks about  they would have long ago ditched the use of those yellow symbols and that  l  hand gesture in favour of true national symbols and colours      despite our sincere efforts  there was never any  sincere effort  coming from the lp to work with duterte  in the lead up to the  presidential elections  the lp campaign against current president rodrigo duterte was nothing short of vicious  in the heat of the campaign  aquino himself called for a united front against duterte  aquino also referred to duterte as  a future threat to democracy   roxas  for his part  mounted an agressive campaign to follow through on that messaging and  in the final stretch to election day  attempted to forge a last ditch  unity  alliance with another rival candidate  senator grace poe  presumably to combine their respective voters  base in the hope of beating duterte who was  by then leading the polls  roxas reportedly described that call for unity as  a call for decency   as if implying that duterte s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency  roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him      the duterte administration is incapable of tolerating dissent  setting aside the fact that the  vice president  is woefully inarticulate considering that she is but a heartbeat away from the presidency of a country of more than a hundred million  the duterte administration seems to have been quite tolerant of her presence as a dissenting voice in the executive branch  indeed  robredo has abused that tolerance by being a party to to groups and communities directly engaged in the planning and instigation of activities meant to destabilise and  eventually  overthrow the government of president rodrigo duterte  she is currently being investigated for her ties with nicolas lewis relating to allegations that her campaign for a seat in congress in  was funded by foreign sponsors  under philippine law  foreign contributions to election campaigns are illegal and politicians caught receiving foreign contributions are subject to permanent exclusion from running for office in the future  contrary to popular belief  the philippine media remains the same rambunctious community of  thought leaders  and  journalists  since filipinos  won their freedom back  in   it is nothing close to being like the broken cowering community of  victims  that robredo is trying to paint them as  so  by all accounts  there is no evidence that the philippine government is engaged in any conspiracy or concerted effort to suppress dissent  so  again  it seems  vice president  leni robredo is acting and making statements way outside of her element  she is part of the executive branch of the philippine government and does not speak for the senate which belongs to the legislative branch  furthermore  senators  being senators  are a tough brass balled bunch who can take care of themselves and don t normally represent themselves to their constituents in the girly sugar and spice manner that characterises robredo s lame political act  best that robredo find other ways to make herself relevant  she can start by firing her pr team for gross incompetence ,1

213,the senate committee on women  children  family relations and gender equality is keen on inviting members of the philippines  aviation security command  avsecom  to shed light on the human trafficking of filipinos into myanmar  the matter of inviting members of the avsecom to the senate s probe into the alleged outbound human trafficking activities in thailand and myanmar was raised by sen  raffy tulfo and was seconded by sen  risa hontiveros  who chairs the senate panel  this was after the panel heard the testimony of  paulo   one of the human trafficking victims  who testified before the committee on how he was given a fake id pass by alleged airport officials at naia terminal  so he can board his flight to thailand where he was supposedly promised work in a telemarketing company  fortunately  paulo said he was able to  escape  from the ordeal which could have led him to work for a crypto scamming job in myanmar  tulfo raised alarm over the incident  pointing out that the incident also shows a  clear and present danger  to the country   meron talagang clear and present danger dito na madaling mapasok ng terorista kung ganon  itong ating mga airports   kasi pwede nila gamiting itong mga fake na passes  wala nang kapkap  wala nang scrutiny  dala dala ang bag na may bomba  and yun  patay na tayo   there is really a clear and present danger here  because it means a terrorist can easily penetrate our airports  because they can use fake passes  no frisking  no scrutiny  they can bring bombs inside and explode and that would be the death of us    tulfo pointed out during the hearing   so meron talaga tayong lapse in security dito  kailangan talaga palalimin natin ang imbestigasyon dito  so we really have a lapse in security here  we really need to get into the bottom of this in this investigation    the senator added   kailangan natin ipatawag ang avsecom  kelangan may masibak sa avsecom  we need to call for the avsecom  heads should roll in the avsecom    he reiterated   sila ang nakakaalam ng proseso  hindi ka pwede pumasok kung hindi ka dumaan sa proseso  may sumalo sa kanila  victims  at may sumundo sa kanila na myembro ng sindikato na kasabwat i m sure may kasabwat dito sa avsecom  na nag i screen ng mga ids  kaya dapat ipatawag ang avsecom at dapat may managot dito  they know the process  you can t enter if you haven t gone through the process  somebody assisted the victims and someone picked them up who is clearly a member of the syndicate  who is evidently an accomplice i m sure there was an accomplice here at avsecom  who screened the ids  so avsecom should be summoned and someone should be held accountable   tulfo also said  hontiveros agreed and directed the panel to send an invitation to the avsecom to appear in the next hearing  in his testimony  paulo explained that his recruiter  a certain laisa magallanes told him that an  escort  would help him with immigration to expedite his departure from the philippines and was told that   would be deducted from his salary for this service  but after checking in  paulo said the so called  escort  told him to get out of the line at the immigration counter and asked him for his passport  when it was returned to him  he was later surprised to see that his passport already has a stamp of the bureau of immigration  bi    even without going through the immigration counter  paulo s passport was stamped with the official bi exit stamp  someone handled him at the airport  bypassed immigration  and gave him a fake id from whsmith  a store in naia terminal   to pretend to be an employee  paulo was suddenly afraid of the process he was being made to go through  so he told the recruiter that he would not continue   hontiveros explained   it s like pastillas part   but worse and more intense  are airport security or personnel also involved  are the illegal recruiters in the pockets and complicity of bi or airport officials  the pain that many filipinos in other countries are suffering because of our fellow filipinos who take advantage for their own interests   the senator added  last week  hontiveros gave a privilege speech about alias rita  and  other overseas filipino workers  ofws   who were promised jobs in thailand  but were trafficked into myanmar to become crypto scammers of a chinese syndicate based in shwe kokko  a town in the kayin state of myanmar  in the hearing  the deputy minority leader called attention to the ofws who are still in myanmar  many of whom are physically abused by their chinese employers  during the hearing she introduced alias  baby   a trafficked filipino who almost died in the hands of her chinese employer in shwe kokko   hindi katanggap tanggap ang sinapit ni baby  kuryente  baton  latigo ang sinapit niya at ng kanyang mga kasama  marami pa sila ang nasa myanmar pa at kailangang kailangan ang agarang aksyon ng ating gobyerno  what happened to baby is unacceptable  she and his companions were subjected to electricity  batons  and whips  many of them are still in myanmar and the immediate action of our government is essential    hontiveros said   unfortunately  many filipinos go through this illegal process  no matter how dubious  because of desperation   she lamented  faced with employment challenges in the philippines  the constant increase in prices while there is no progress in workers  salaries  hontiveros said filipinos cannot be blamed if they choose to accept dubious job opportunities just to give something to their families   this is also a challenge for us in government not only to clean up our immigration system  but also to urgently provide adequate and dignified jobs and livelihood for every filipino   hontiveros stressed   ,0

by the executive secretary   the minority would like to point out that there were clearly badges of good faith on the part of usec  sebastian  administrator serafica  and board members beltran and valderrama that the committee report apparently failed to notice and give importance to   the minority senators said in the  paged report   aside from the fact that there was no evidence of an intention to conceal the execution of so no   from the president  the sworn affidavits and the testimonies of the four key persons made during the public hearings are consistent in their assertion that they only did their job and what they believed were required of them at that given time   they said  pimentel and hontiveros also said the recommendation of the majority to initiate adminstrative and criminal charges against them and to issue a look out bulletin  are lacking factual and legal basis    these are human beings ah  with careers  reputation and families the treatment is undeserved  uncalled for  and unjustified   pimentel said  the minority senators also said the blue ribbon committee report  failed  or purposefully refrained  to discuss the part which es rodriguez played in this unfortunate debacle   rodriguez  they said  was insinuating that there was an intent on behalf of the sra board members to conceal the execution of so no   froom the president  but the testimonies during the hearings and sworn affidavits submitted clearly established that all documents  including the planning and drafting of the sugar order  recommendations  were promptly communicated to the office of the president through the office of the executive secretary  pimentel pointed out  he  rodriguez  also admitted he purposely did not answer  sebastian   by virtue of his position  executive secretary rodriguez has a direct link to the president  he stands as the gatekeeper to the president   they said  the minority senators added   there would not have been any miscommunication had the executive secretary simply replied that the sra board should give the president more time to study the  draft  so no   and to hold in abeyance the planned referendum pending advice or instruction from the office of the president    it was clear to us early on that all communications related to the issuance of s o  no   were timely and clearly communicated to the executive secretary  however  the executive secretary s unilateral decision to sit on it contributed to the debacle   hontiveros said  during a press briefing  she also called the recommendation to file criminal and administrative charges against the four officials to be  disproportionately punitive    walang basehan at hindi makatarungan kung kakasuhan pa sila  hindi dapat pinagdidiskitahan ng administrasyon ang mga empleyado ng gobyerno na ginagawa lang naman ang trabaho nila  there is no basis and it is an injustice if they are going to face cases just for this  the administration should not be threatening government employees who are just doing their job    she said  asked why the minority report did not recommend any charges to be filed against rodriguez  pimentel said they have opted not to and would just like to appeal to other senators to  let this be on their conscience  instead   wala  di na kami nag recommend ng charges against rodriguez  let it be na lang  let this be on their conscience na lang  and this is addressed to the majority   pimentel said   we will cross examine them  majority senators  when they decide to charge the four personalities   he said   ,0

286,the court of appeals  ca  has voided two search warrants issued by the quezon city regional trial court  rtc  that led to the seizure of firearms  ammunition and explosives allegedly in possession of three human rights activists who were arrested in manila in  and charged criminally in court  in a decision written by associate justice emily l  san gaspar gito  the ca also reversed the ruling of the manila rtc  where the cases were filed  which denied the plea of activists ram carlo bautista  alma moran  and reina mae nasino to suppress the illegally seized evidence and to nullify the search warrants  bautista  moran and nasino were arrested on nov     in tondo  manila on the basis of search warrants issued by judge cecilyn burgos villavert of quezon city rtc  seized in their alleged possession were one hand grenade  a   caliber pistol and magazine with live ammunition  a bushmaster    mm rifle with magazine and live ammunition and several other alleged illegal items    criminal cases were filed against them before the manila rtc for violations of presidential decree no    as amended by republic act no    an act further amending the provisions of presidential decree no    as amended  entitled  codifying the laws on illegal unlawful possession  manufacture  dealing in  acquisition or disposition of firearms  ammunition or explosives or instruments used in the manufacture of firearms  ammunition or explosives  and imposing stiffer penalties for certain violations thereof   and r a    an act providing for a comprehensive law on firearms and ammunition and providing penalties for violations thereof   they pleaded to nullify the search warrants and to suppress the use of alleged evidence reportedly seized in their possession  they told the trial court  among other things  that search was illegal because it was done at an address different from that stated in the warrant  that the evidence seized during the search are inadmissible because they  fruits of a poisonous tree   the warrants were invalid for lack of specificity of the place to the search and the items subject of the search  and the search was invalid because it was not conducted in the presence of the lawful occupant or done in the presence of two witnesses  when their plea to quash the search warrants and to suppress the evidence seized during the implementation of the warrants were denied by manila rtc judge marivic t  balisi umali  they filed a petition with the ca  at the time of her arrest  nasino was pregnant  in detention  she delivered a baby girl on july    at the height of the covid  pandemic  the manila city rtc denied nasino s petition to be with her newly born child either at the hospital of inside her jail dormitory to be able to breastfeed her    nasino elevated the issue before the ca which dismissed her petition on account of mootness since the baby had died and had been buried  on the criminal charges as a result of the two search warrants  the three activists denied the charges against them and pointed out they were arrested without a warrant of arrest  they told the ca that the firearms  ammunition and explosives do not belong to them and were just planted by the raiding team  in granting their petition  nullifying the search warrants  and suppressing the use as evidence of the items seized during the search  the ca said   the right against unreasonable searches and seizures is one of the fundamental constitutional rights that remains constant despite the everchanging constitution of our country  from the  malolos constitution to the present  constitution   the protection afforded by the right was further reinforced by its recognition as a basic human right under the international covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights  to both of which the philippines has given its imprimatur   both the convention and the declaration recognize a person s right against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one s privacy and property   courts are therefore expected to be vigilant in preventing its stealthy encroachment or gradual depreciation and ensure that the safeguards put in place for its protection are observed  we do so today   a search under the strength of a warrant is required to be witnessed by the lawful occupant of the premises sought to be searched  it must be stressed that it is only upon their absence that their presence may be replaced by two    persons of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality   in the present case  petitioners were actually present in the place but what is disconcerting is that petitioner bautista was required to leave the room while the search was being conducted  it was only later on that he was called and the items seized were shown to him  this is irregular   thus  the argument of respondent people that the subject search warrants specifically identified petitioner bautista s house does not hold water  to the point of being repetitive  the subject search warrants indicated the wrong address and with the wrong description  which resulted to the improper implementation thereof   the implementation of the subject search warrants is further marred by irregularities committed by the officers in the actual conduct of the search  notably  the search in petitioner bautista s room was not made in his presence  as he was brought downstairs  it was only when he was brought back to his room  this time in the presence of the barangay officials  that the seized items were shown to him  not having seen the actual search conducted on his room  he wrote  up  when he signed the two    certification of orderly search  indicating he was signing them  under protest    meanwhile  on the part of petitioners moran and nasino  they were hand tied and made to lie face down during the search conducted in their rooms   it should be stressed that the subject search warrants were addressed to petitioner bautista only  notwithstanding so  petitioners moran and nasino were likewise subjected to the search and several items  which were not in plain view  were allegedly confiscated from them   clearly  petitioners  right against unreasonable search and seizures was blatantly trampled upon   another fact worth mentioning is that while the address in the subject search warrants indicate brgy    the barangay officials who were present during the search were from brgy    thus further emphasizing the point that the address in the subject search warrants is erroneous   with the erroneous addresses that were never clarified  there isbut one logical conclusion  i e   the applicant and his witnesses did not really have personal knowledge of the surrounding facts which would have justified the issuance of the subject search warrants  consequently  the existence of probable cause is doubtful   wherefore  in view of the foregoing disquisition  the instant petition is hereby granted  the orders dated july    and july    are hereby reversed and set aside   search warrants nos      and     are declared void for failure to meet the standards of a valid search warrant  and all evidence procured by virtue thereof are deemed inadmissible so ordered   associate justices eduardo b  peralta jr  and walter s  ong concurred in the decision   ,0

292,  indeed  ruling filipinos with an iron fist seems more effective than the softly softly approach that has been used since marcos left   filipinos do not know what they want  in   hundreds of thousands of filipinos took to the streets to rally against the late strongman  former president ferdinand marcos  the three day protest eventually led to the ousting of the so called  dictator  and alleged human rights violator  twenty five years later  filipinos from the mindanao region of davao are lauding the duterte family for their style of leadership that is reminiscent of the marcos years  they love the duterte mayors particularly former mayor who is now the vice mayor to his daughter sara  gun toting rodrigo for their wild west style no nonsense leadership  most filipinos from davao or the davaoeños are quite aware of the hired mercenaries   what they dub the  davao death squads   dds    and are even proud to say that the phantom team is largely responsible for keeping the peace and the order in their beloved city  they say that since the people cannot rely on the justice system  these death squads at least keep the criminals off the streets  which in turn makes it safer for regular people to walk about  full disclosure  these are all based on anecdotal statements and not on an official study  most vocal davaoeños would readily admit that the improvised system works for them  one commentator even asked the question   if an iron fisted machiavellian approach is preferable to enforce peace   order  are you saying that  better off not having the edsa revolution in the first place   indeed  ruling filipinos with an iron fist seems more effective than the softly softly approach that has been used since marcos left  i even received a lot of hostility from duterte supporters for my article criticizing mayor sara s use of violence to get her way  so  i thought  hmmm there must be something that people from other regions in the philippines are missing  the evidence  in fact  seems to speaks for itself  the department of tourism awarded davao the distinction of being the  most livable city in the philippines in   and  according to reports  the foreign direct investment magazine had even highlighted davao as  the  asian city of the future    the importance of davao as a regional trade hub is highlighted by its transport infrastructure  davao s airport is the busiest in mindanao  and the city also boasts two government and nine private seaports  construction of more roads and bridges is underway according to their website  now that is something to think about  as the fifth largest city in the philippines  davao s economy has grown steadily in the last two decades  there is no shortage of investors in the city of   million and most people there attribute all this to the efforts of their beloved mayor whose efforts at cleaning up the city and introducing economic reforms  which include dismantling of protection for  infant industries  and the breakdown of industries with monopolistic or cartel tendencies  seem to have paid off  it s been said that davao contributed significantly to making the philippines the world s top exporter of papaya  mangosteen  and even flowers  the annual income of davao city in  is said to have reached  billion pesos  the richest city in the country outside of metro manila   so i now wonder  wouldn t the rest of the philippines be better off electing rodrigo duterte clones to their respective local governments to effect the same level of discipline we see in davao  just imagine if the image and likeness of  the man  together with his brand of  leadership  is put in place in every city in the country  the result might see the entire country being more than eligible for  the most livable place on earth  award  that scenario would be just short of amazing  i guess all that is needed is for us to turn a blind eye to the activities of the hired mercenaries  which if the rumor is true  goes hand in hand with a duterte styled management  and if one commentator  an avid duterte supporter  is correct  for as long as you are not a drug pusher or do not engage in criminal activities  you can be assured that you won t get any visits from any  death squad  any time soon  in short  if we take the word of a davaoeño who has for some time enjoyed relative peace and order  it s all good  apparently  even the human rights advocates have not been very vocal about their complaints either  who wouldn t want a curfew on minors observed in the city  under the duterte rule  all business establishments  in particular bars and discos  would be mandated by a city ordinance to refrain from selling alcoholic drinks beyond   am  that would certainly reduce the number of casualties that result from public brawls and drink driving accidents the roads would be a lot safer too because motorists will be forced to observe road rules and regulations  regular checkpoints in key parts of city and at the city boundaries will be in place round the clock to ensure strict implementation of traffic rules  and just like in davao  motorcycle drivers with no helmets and motorists with defective lights will not be allowed to enter or drive in any city in luzon and the visayas the use of fireworks and other pyrotechnics  as well as smoking  would be strictly prohibited in the entire country  we will have more people with complete sets of fingers if illegal fireworks traditionally lit on new year s eve are banned  smoking will be banned too   even outdoors  if you are under a roof of any kind  violators will be made to pay hefty fines  perform community service  serve jail time  or a combination of the three  president noynoy aquino will most likely be forced to quit smoking  and while we are at it  we can extend similar penalties to people who love singing in the wee hours of the morning  but this will be the most shocking rule for all filipinos in luzon and visayas  littering would be prohibited  i don t know how filipinos would be able to adjust to this  the death squad will be likely to have their hands full implementing this rule alone considering how most filipinos can t seem to kick their tossing habit  there will definitely be a mother of a withdrawal period as filipinos quit cold turkey throwing their trash wherever they please just think about it  for almost three decades  filipinos have enjoyed their so called freedom to lay waste over the entire country  isn t it time that someone with an iron fist instill discipline on all of us  or are individual rights and civil liberties more important than a clean and safe environment  you decide what you want ,1

295,former senator leila de lima recalled that the international criminal court  icc  prosecutor already mentioned the names of former president rodrigo duterte and former philippine national police  pnp  chief and now senator ronald dela rosa as two of the personalities possibly responsible for the state sponsored killings under the previous administration s war on illegal drugs       so long as the government is not going after the top leadership of the pnp death squads who committed the killings  the icc will not be dissuaded from ordering the prosecutor to resume his investigation on duterte s crimes against humanity    she said in a viber message to senate reporters  in her statement  de lima claimed that the current marcos administration  through the office of the solicitor general  seeks to stop the investigation of the widespread extra judicial killings  ejks  committed during duterte s drug war   which  i firmly contend  amount to crimes against humanity     they want the international criminal court s pre trial chamber to tell the icc prosecutor not to resume its investigation  this government says that the icc has no jurisdiction because the killings were not a systematic attack on the filipino civilian population and that the philippine state is investigating and prosecuting whatever crimes were committed  solicitor general menardo guevarra also claims that the killings were not the result of a state policy or program to kill drug suspects in police operations    she stressed    these porous claims cannot persuade the icc  the icc is the least of all to believe these claims considering the amount of evidence already gathered by the icc prosecutor showing that the killings were indeed state sponsored  no less than the public statements of duterte himself calling on the pnp to eliminate drug suspects are on record in the icc prosecutor s investigation  guevarra cannot go on denying that duterte publicly ordered the killings with his arrogant and reckless statements    the ex senator added    de lima maintained that it is  callous and narrow minded  if not dishonest  for the office of the solicitor general  osg  to deny the existence of a state sponsored systematic attack when we all witnessed the prevalent  almost daily occurrence  especially at the height of duterte s drug war mid  up to   of summary executions of suspected drug offenders by pnp and vigilante death squads   she said that the icc would also just brush aside guevarra s claim that the philippine state is able and willing to investigate and prosecute the drug war killings    then and now  the government is unable to show the icc any convincing proof of the existence of a genuine domestic investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the drug war carnage  particularly those with the highest responsibility therefor  up to the present  neither the doj nor the ombudsman is in the process of filing any criminal action against duterte despite his loss of immunity    she emphasized    the marcos jr  government is also not investigating or prosecuting duterte s top pnp generals and officers who carried out his unlawful orders during the drug war    she said  de lima said that   the rome statute is a robust international institution that will not be defeated or dissuaded by the propaganda and rhetorics of duterte s defenders and enablers who  sadly  still bear much clout under the present dispensation     resisting an intervention by icc  an international body equipped with the competence and singular determination to inquire into crimes of such scale as crimes against humanity  and beyond the reach of the influence of the strongman former president  connotes a misplaced sense of national self worth  true justice for thousands of victims of the drug war killings cannot be denied on account of a false notion of sovereignty    she added   ,0

destination   this  after the department of trade and industry  dti  tuesday presented to marcos the proposed eo on the creation of green lane for strategic investments after identifying the barrier across multiple regulatory agencies that hamper the smooth entry of foreign direct investments  fdis  in the country   malaking bagay  yun  that will address immediately  yung tinatawag na ease of doing business na laging nirereklamo sa atin  that s a huge thing  that will immediately address the complaints we receive regarding ease of doing business    marcos told dti officials during their meeting in malacañang   until we get to change the procedures    and to say that    baka ito hindi na kailangan  baka ito extraneous na ito  ito obsolete na ito  ganyan  maybe  it s no longer needed  maybe it s extraneous  it s obsolete  like that   you cut it down as much as we can   he added  cheloy garafil  officer in charge  office of the press secretary  said the eo will mandate concerned offices to establish a green lane to expedite and streamline the process and requirements for the issuance of permits and licenses  including resolutions of issues concerning strategic investments

investment promotion agencies  government agencies and local government units to effect greater synergies  we also continue to help in the ease of doing business in the country   marcos said in his speech at the  philippine business conference and expo in manila   we are doing this by enhancing our digital infrastructure in order to streamline application processes  business permits  licenses and other documentary requirements   he added  the president has also reiterated his government s commitment  to make the philippines a viable option for businesses  both for local and foreign investors    that is why we feel that not only do we encourage foreign direct investment  not only do we encourage capital intensive investments in our country  but we also very much must understand

302,looking to  reintroduce the philippines  to the world  president ferdinand marcos jr  has plans for his nation on the international stage and at home   if  that is  the twin specters of pandemic and climate change can be overcome or at least managed  and if he can surmount the legacies of two people  his predecessor and his father  he also wants to strengthen ties with both the united states and china   a delicate balancing act for the southeast asian nation   and  like many of his fellow leaders at the united nations this week  called on the countries that have caused global warming to help less wealthy nations counteract its effects  in a separate interview with former australian prime minister kevin rudd here  marcos also laid out his economic agenda where he hoped there would be  not one more hungry filipino   marcos  swept into office in the may  philippine elections  is drawing distinctions both subtle and obvious between himself and his voluble predecessor  rodrigo duterte  who alienated many international partners with his violent approach to fighting drug trafficking and the coarse rhetoric he used to galvanize supporters  asked if duterte went too far with his lethal drug crackdown  marcos redirected the criticism toward those who carried out the plan   his people went too far sometimes   marcos told the associated press on friday   we have seen many cases where policemen  other operatives  some were just shady characters that we didn t quite know where they came from and who they were working for  but now we ve gone after them   marcos said that his administration s war on drugs will shift its focus to target the big networks involved in such illegal activity in the country and not on  the kid who makes  a week selling weed   marcos said that he ordered the philippine national police to  go after people who   if we get them  if we neutralize them  or put them in jail  we put them away  whatever it is   will make an actual difference so that the supply of drugs  the system of distribution  the system of importation of drugs because much of it really does come from abroad    that will actually make a difference  it will put a stop to it  and that s what we are working on right now   the president added  citing that the  argument or rather the discussion about human rights in the philippines in the past few years has really derived from the anti drug war that president duterte undertook   marcos said what can be done is  to examine and learn lessons from the experience from the past administration   he said that  enforcement  which has been the part of the drug war that has been most vigorously pursued by president duterte  only gets you so far   marcos said that instead of simply enforcement  the  focus  would be on  prevention  education and cure    to be more sensitive and more sympathetic to those who actually have gotten caught up in this lifestyle   he added   not one more hungry filipino  in the same interview with rudd at the asia society here  marcos said what he hoped to achieve with his economic agenda was simple   not one more hungry filipino    it s a very simple aim  it s a very simple goal   said marcos  acknowledging that  it is not necessarily a simple problem to solve  and it requires a great deal of effort and thinking on the part of the public sector   marcos sits concurrently as the philippines  agriculture secretary  the president noted the importance of their partnership with the private sector to reach the administration s goals  so far  the country is addressing the supposed shortage of sugar and rising prices of basic commodities  but marcos said improving agricultural productivity and streamlining bureaucracy will ensure a more efficient government service  adding that this will be among his administration s strategies to ensure economic transformation  in the same event  marcos also touted the country s macroeconomic fundamentals and enabling policies as among the main reasons that make the philippines a leading investment destination  he said the philippine economy expanded by   percent last year and   percent in the first half of this year  marcos also cited enabling policies and investor friendly laws that seek to  leverage game changing reforms   he also took note of the country s human capital and boasted of a  young  educated  hardworking and english speaking workforce that is globally competitive   family legacy marcos    sat for a wide ranging interview in new york on the sidelines of the un general assembly s annual leaders  meeting  three months into his administration  he seemed energetic and enthusiastic   and eager to project his vision for the nation beyond its borders  on thursday  he met with us president joe biden in a bid to strengthen the sometimes complicated ties that have ebbed and flowed between the two nations since the philippines spent four decades as an american colony in the early  century   there have been bits and pieces where they were not perhaps ideal   marcos told the associated press   but in the end  that overall trajectory has been to strengthen and strengthen and strengthen our relationship   in addition to duterte  marcos also must draw distinctions between himself and the most iconic figure in the philippines  public sphere  his late father  whose name he shares  ferdinand e  marcos sr   hero to some and plundering dictator to others  ruled from the  to the   including a tumultuous period of martial law and repression  he made the family reputation an indelible part of filipino history  addressing the family legacy directly is something the son has been loath to do  at least explicitly  though he vehemently rejects use of the term  dictator  to describe his father s rule  to him  the political baggage of his parents is a remnant of the past   i did not indulge in any of that political back and forth concerning the marcos family   he said   all i spoke about was   what are we going to do to get into a better place   and people responded   engaging  he said  would have simply been a retread   and an unnecessary one   it doesn t help  it doesn t change anything   he said   so what s the point   the elder marcos placed the philippines under martial law in   a year before his term was to expire  he padlocked congress and newspaper offices  ordered the arrest of political opponents and activists and ruled by decree  thousands of filipinos disappeared under his rule  some have never been accounted for  no to icc when it comes to his predecessor  marcos treads a nuanced political line as well  distinguishing himself from duterte s in your face rule can benefit him at home and internationally  but duterte s popularity helped catapult him into office  and the former president s daughter sara is marcos  vice president  the extrajudicial killings associated with duterte s years long crackdown provoked calls that his administration should be investigated from the outside  and he vowed not to rejoin the international criminal court   a precept that marcos agrees with  after all  marcos asked  why should a country with a functioning legal system be judged from elsewhere   we have a judiciary  it s not perfect   he said   i do not understand why we need an outside adjudicator to tell us how to investigate  who to investigate  how to go about it   marcos cast the coronavirus pandemic as many other leaders have   as a balancing act between keeping people safe and making sure life can push forward   we took a very extreme position in the philippines  and we eventually had the longest lockdown in any country in the world   he said   that was the choice of the previous government  and now  we are now coming out of it   in recent days  he has both removed a national mandate to wear masks outdoors and extended a  state of calamity    something he said he didn t necessarily want to do  but keeping the declaration in place allows more people to continue getting help   it s not very encouraging when people look at your country and they see   well  it s under a state of calamity   that s not good for tourists  it s not good for visitors  it s not good for business   marcos said  encouraging ties with china  particularly given beijing s aggressive maritime policies  might be a daunting prospect for a nation so closely and historically aligned with the united states  but  marcos says  it s possible   and necessary   it is a very fine line that we have to tread in the philippines   the president said   we do not subscribe to the old cold war  spheres of influence      so it s really guided by national interest  number one  and second  the maintenance of peace   peace comes in many flavors  last week  marcos traveled to the southern part of the nation   a predominantly muslim area of a predominantly catholic country   to express support for a multiyear effort to help a onetime rebel group  the moro islamic liberation front  give up their guns and govern their autonomous region effectively  while moro has come into the government fold  smaller militant groups including the violent abu sayyaf have continued to fight

379,a heated exchange between sen  raffy tulfo and sen  cynthia villar on the conversion of farmlands to residential areas marked the deliberations on the proposed budget of the department of agriculture  da   which dragged on till the early morning hours on thursday  tensions rose as tulfo asked about two issues in a way that visibly miffed villar  who was then defending the da budget  the conversion of farmlands into subdivisions and the negative impact of the rice tariffication law on farmers   tulfo stood to ask what the da had been doing about the  prevalent  irregularities in the construction of farm to market roads  fmrs  across the country   this program is peppered with corruption and is being used by influential politicians for their own benefit   fmrs  become cockpit to market  subdivision to market  or resort to market roads   he said  tulfo further asked how the da was validating these projects  citing the case of some localities that became  riddled  with the fmrs even though they were not producing rice  corn or vegetables   our lowly farmers are being duped because the money that was intended for them to help them bring their produce to the market was being abused by politicians who have seen and are exploiting this loophole in the system   he said  villar explained that while funds for fmr come from the da  it is the department of public works and highways  dpwh  that builds the roads  the existence of the projects are validated through drone technology  she added  tulfo asked for a report on all fmrs constructed by the da  which he said he would use to validate the projects on site  da dpwh  collusion   this is a problem because when collusion happens between the da and the dpwh  the nation is lost   he said  during the duterte administration  the dpwh was headed by villar s son and now fellow senator mark  through the years  the family  headed by the patriarch  former senate president manny villar  has built a business empire centered on the real estate sector and has also expanded to include shopping malls  convenience stores  coffee and pastry shops  banks  and more recently  broadcasting  tulfo cited a  commission on audit report that flagged  million worth of unfinished fmr projects  with only four out of  completed    this by itself is proof that this program is replete with irregularities   he said  tulfo then asked why the da had been allowing the  massive  conversion of farmlands in the provinces to become housing complexes  which he said was undermining the country s food security   the farmlands are shrinking because these are being bought by large  developers  which is why subdivisions have now spread in the provinces   he added   we don t buy agri land  villar replied   you know  that is our business  i want to tell you that we don t buy agricultural land  we only buy lands in cities and capital towns   she explained that buyers of the houses sold by her companies only wanted the opportunity to resell the property in times of financial difficulty   you have to understand that agriculture  a business also  you sell your land at a higher price to buy a bigger piece of land in less prime places where you will do your farming   she said  but tulfo said the farmers were being exploited when they were forced to sell their farmland at low prices due to decreasing yield and the low selling price of their produce supposedly due to the rice tariffication law  under the law  republic act no    signed by then president rodrigo duterte in january   annual revenues from tariff collected on rice imports that are in excess of  billion shall be distributed as cash assistance to small farmers tilling two hectares of land or less  the scheme will run up to   no guilt at this point  a more assertive villar reminded tulfo that she  wrote the law  herself  before explaining why the country needed it to address one of the most pressing challenges for farmers  the high cost of rice production   i don t feel any guilt to the small rice farmers  all the money that came from  was given to small farmers   she said   in response  tulfo suggested that  instead of allowing farmland conversion  the da should give farmers capital to buy farm machines and stave off real estate developers   this is why i am pushing for the passage of the national land use act  four presidents have come and gone but this bill has not been passed  and i wonder why   he said  villar said she disagreed with tulfo on this point  saying a national law was no longer needed for this purpose since local governments already had their respective land use plans  to defuse the tension  senate president juan miguel zubiri suspended the session  when it resumed  tulfo  now apologetic for the lateness of the hour  said he was now too  ashamed  to ask some more questions  he then turned to villar again and asked   madam chair  are you tired   villar  now smiling  said she had always been tolerant and suggested that she and tulfo have a personal session where she could answer his other questions   ,0

381,warning that ordinary consumers risked paying higher electricity prices  president ferdinand marcos jr  on sunday said he hoped the court of appeals  ca  would reconsider its issuance of a temporary restraining order  tro  suspending the implementation of the power supply agreement  psa  between south premiere power corp   sppc   a unit of conglomerate san miguel corp   smc   and manila electric co   meralco     the  implementation of the psa between meralco and san miguel  it is unfortunate that this has happened   it will cause further dislocations and possible price increase for power   the president said in a statement   we hope that the ca will reconsider  and include in their deliberations the extremely deleterious effect this will have on power prices for ordinary filipinos   he added  the tro request stemmed from the energy regulatory commission s  erc  rejection of the joint smc meralco petition for a  centavo per kilowatt hour increase to offset soaring fuel prices as a result of russia s invasion of ukraine  smc had argued that there was a  change in circumstance  after the psa was signed in   citing skyrocketing coal and fuel prices  due to the surge in the cost of imported coal  for example  it became more expensive to operate its power plant  but it was unable to pass on the added cost to consumers because the erc rejected its proposed rate increase  from   smc said its power entities had so far incurred  billion in losses for operating its coal fired power plant in sual  pangasinan  and its natural gas fed facility in ilijan  batangas  the regulatory body  in its sept   order  ruled that the agreed price in the psa was fixed in nature  and the grounds for increase cited by sppc and meralco were not among the exceptions that would allow for a price adjustment   day effectivity smc appealed the erc rejection and the ca last week granted the tro requested by smc  this move could lead to a spike in the monthly power bills of meralco customers  a concern raised by the erc  the erc cited a portion of the ca ruling dated nov       in view of the circumstances and the interest of the general public  this court grants the tro and hereby suspends the implementation of the psa  the tro shall be effective for a period of  days from service on respondents   erc chair monalisa dimalanta expressed  grave concern on the instantaneous effect  of the temporary suspension of supply agreements  in a statement  she said this would expose about   million meralco customers in metro manila and adjacent areas to higher electricity prices as the fixed rates in the current psas would no longer be enforced  according to the regulatory body  the fixed price psa of meralco with sppc covered  megawatts  mw  of supply and dimalanta stressed that such agreements  have been shielding meralco consumers for the past several months from the volatility of prices from wesm  wholesale electricity spot market  and automatic fuel pass through psas   nonetheless  the erc expressed confidence that the ca  will accord great respect  if not finality  to the regulator s factual findings because of its special expertise over the energy sector   with the suspension of the psa due to the tro  meralco might be forced to buy more expensive electricity to supply customers in its franchise area  meralco said it would consult its counsel to explore the next steps in light of the ca decision and would follow up with the department of energy  doe  on its prior request to immediately secure additional power supply without going through the required competitive selection process  csp    we have written the doe to follow up on our previous letter requesting for csp exemption of certain emergency psas to shield our customers against volatile and potentially higher wesm prices   said jose ronald valles  first vice president and head of regulatory management of meralco  opposing views consumer group power for people coalition    had lambasted the ca for what it described as an  illogical and anticonsumer  resolution on the issue   the tro is absurd and rash  it suspended the psa between smc and meralco  which governs how smc can supply meralco with electricity and how much smc can charge   gerry arances   convener  said in a statement  terry ridon  convener of infrawatch ph  a think tank focusing on resolving infrastructure underdevelopment in power  transport  telecommunications  water  public works  and natural resources  said the president should allow full judicial proceedings to take their course and  his views may ably be represented through erc lawyers and the solicitor general   ridon added that the tro would allow continuing discussions on the fair and reasonable rates which could be imposed on the meralco franchise area given elevated fuel and coal prices in the last few months   this provides a way forward toward a determination on whether the price proposal in the joint petition constitutes the least cost to consumers in comparison to other prospective proposals extraneous to the current power supply agreement  such as prices through emergency procurement or the spot market   ridon added  according to dimalanta  the erc would defer to the appellate court on their next move  but it already referred the issue to the office of the solicitor general  the decision of the erc rejecting the joint petition of smc and meralco for a rate hike was a close   vote  the two dissenting erc commissioners   alexis lumbatan and marko romeo fuentes   noted that  under the smc meralco petition  meralco customers would have to pay an additional   billion over a six month recovery period  under scenario two  where erc rejected the petition  and smc withdrew from its psa  leaving meralco to secure a one year emergency supply deal  meralco consumers would have to pay an additional   billion for electricity  a similar scenario where the power would be sourced through a competitive selection process would result in an additional burden of   billion for meralco customers  a third scenario that has meralco sourcing power from the electricity spot market will burden consumers with   billion every single month  the two dissenting commissioners pointed to an internal simulation done by the erc s regulatory operations service  ros  to determine  which available option best serves and protects the consumers   the ros in its response  through alvin jones ortega  chief of the tariffs and rates division  confirmed that granting the price adjustment remained the cheapest option   the dissenting erc commissioners said ,0

440,  de lima wasn t ousted because she was critical of duterte or because she was digging into his alleged role in the davao death squad  she was ousted by her own colleagues because they believed she was using the senate to get back at her enemy    i might be jumping to conclusions  but what if it is true   those are the words of senator leila de lima in her privilege speech right after she said  the implication is that we have a group of serial killers and mass murderers right within the ranks of the organization which is supposed to protect and serve the people  damn  i won t blame other people if they start swearing at de lima  she believes her own lies  she admits to not having the evidence to prove her allegations that there are members of the philippine national police who are abusing their power but she already talks to the media  particularly the members of foreign media as if what she s saying has been proven without a shadow of a doubt  the fact that her privilege speech was addressed to president rodrigo duterte is already accusatory  without providing evidence of her  theory   she already painted duterte as the mastermind behind her ousting from the senate justice committee investigating the alleged extrajudicial killings  her accusations are an insult to the senators who can think  independently   de lima seems to be accusing them too of collaborating with duterte to undermine her  that is not going to earn her any brownie points among her colleagues  she is digging her own grave  she already earned the ire of some senators and  as such  she should quit talking while she s ahead  she just keeps yakking away  her privilege speech is enough to give most people a headache  it was all about how she had become a victim in her crusade to stop the alleged  extrajudicial killings   granted  the head of the executive branch of government does have a track record of strong arming members of congress into doing what he wanted them to do  specifically during bs aquino s term  this was evident during the impeachment and trial to remove the late former chief justice renato corona from his post  but there was strong motivation among the congressmen and senators to accede to bs aquino s wishes back then   because they had to appease the president so he could give them funds from the priority development assistance fund  pdaf  and the disbursement acceleration program  dap   both of which had been scrapped after the supreme court ruled they were illegal  this is not the case with the current administration  besides  the circumstances of de lima s ouster from the justice committee chairmanship is different from corona s ouster from the supreme court  de lima s was more of a random decision based on conduct unbecoming of a senator that she had exhibited  indeed  de lima wasn t ousted because she was critical of duterte or because she was digging into his alleged role in the davao death squad  she was ousted by her own colleagues because they believed she was using the senate to get back at her enemy  in other words  she was abusing her position and dragging the reputation of the senate through the mud  to quote senator win gatchalian   senate committees are tasked with shaping policy direction and crafting legislative reforms  unfortunately  under the leadership of senator de lima  the committee on justice had become a hollow vehicle for the fulfillment of personal political vendettas    we simply had to put a stop to that   gatchalian s statement said  he said the decision  was a difficult one   but he added that  in the end  i am confident that we made the right choice to protect the integrity of the senate and to safeguard its reputation as a true and faithful instrument to further the interests of the filipino people    de lima is definitely not objective anymore  she has an axe to grind  some say she is behaving like a mad woman  if she feels like the whole world is conspiring against her  then she should now appreciate what former president gloria arroyo felt when she was denied her right to travel abroad and her right to presumption of innocence back in   that was the time de lima stopped arroyo at the airport as she was leaving to seek medical treatment abroad and detained her even when there was no case against her at that time  de lima is now holding on to the sole witness against duterte  edgar matobato   a witness she did not tell the other members of the justice committee she will be presenting beforehand  in her privilege speech  she did not really explain why she did not tell senator panfilo lacson about matobato  she just said that as early as    edgar matobato has already been identified by one dds witness as a companion of said witness in one of his dds   as if that makes any sense at all  this raises the question as to why de lima didn t use him earlier  i dare de lima supporters to ask her why she didn t use matobato against duterte when she was still the chair of the commission on human rights  chr  or when she was secretary of the department of justice  doj   what the hell is wrong with people who still believe in de lima s drama  she failed in her roles in the chr and doj  now less than six months in the senate  she is proving to be a failure as a senator too  there are still gullible people who believe in people who play the victim card  they pose a hindrance to philippine progress  some of de lima s supporters say they would rather believe the words of matobato   a murderer who confesses in his role in the davao death squads   than the words of a convicted drug lord like herbert colangco  while both matobato and colangco are both scumbags who are just trying to save their own asses because they don t have a choice  colangco s testimonies against de lima are supported by the fact that he ran bilibid like he owned the place and he did it with impunity since as he insinuated  de lima turned a blind eye to his activities because she was getting a cut from his seedy profits   during a congressional inquiry on drug proliferation at the new bilibid prisons  colangco likened the prison facility s maximum security compound to the manila red light district in roxas boulevard  ang maximum po ay ginawa ko talagang parang roxas boulevard  kahit walang dalaw  sample model binayaran ko ng   sa labas  ibebenta ko sa loob ng     colangco said in the house of representatives   i turn the maximum  into roxas boulevard  a sample model i pay   for outside  i sell for     colangco said he was running a resort like hotel with facilities like air conditioning and shower inside the maximum security compound  he earlier confessed selling boxes of beer during his concerts in the bilibid  which he said senator leila de lima had allowed in exchange for share in the money   how can de lima explain these allegations  she was doj secretary for six years but did not stop or was too incompetent and  possibly  too corrupt to stop the debauchery that went on inside the national penitentiary  this is an outrage  this is something her supporters need to address too  they can t let her off the hook just because they hate duterte  the current problems duterte has to deal with are the result of the previous government s ineptitude  which de lima was a part of  she just doesn t have the moral high ground to criticise duterte for her own failures  i do hope that the new justice secretary vitaliano aguirre will file formal charges against de lima soon so de lima can have her day in court  we all know that senate hearings are mostly in aid of grandstanding politicians  not legislation ,1

456,president ferdinand marcos jr  has ordered the department of environment and natural resources  denr  to bolster its regulatory powers on small and large scale mining to ensure that standards are updated and that mining firms are strictly implementing their respective safety and health programs for workers  marcos made this instruction in a meeting with denr officials in malacañang last week   we want to legalize small scale mining firms because many of them are still illegal and the miners have no protection  we want to strengthen the regulatory framework for them to operate legally and to give our miners assistance and protection for a safe working condition   marcos said  he also expressed the need to enhance social protection and security for workers in the mining industry   we might be able to access financing  they might be able to access social protection   marcos told denr officials  the miners    they have no safety  a lot of them have died   marcos lamented  referring to miners who do not have the proper training or inadequate safety measures inside the mines  on small scale mining  there are bills that the president may certify as urgent  including the amendment to republic act  ra   to incentivize small scale mining  ssm  to provide social assistance and labor protection as well as government assistance programs  under ra   or the  act creating a people s small scale mining program   ssm pertains to mining activities that rely heavily on manual labor using simple implementation and methods  the law also defines small scale mining as an activity that does not use explosives or heavy mining equipment   i think for now the need is for the regulatory capabilities  especially for the small scale   marcos said  destructive mining unabated  in southern philippines  destructive mining practices both by small scale and large scale miners continue unabated  in zamboanga peninsula  open pit mining has become a practice by commercial miners  in tawi tawi province  languyan town shows the devastation of nickel mining activities there  environmentalists said nickel mining activities have also destroyed the environment on tumbagaan island and other sites in tawi tawi  mining money was also being used in the past to bankroll political campaigns in the muslim autonomous region comprising the provinces of tawi tawi  basilan  sulu  lanao del sur and maguindanao  as early as   the regional legislative assembly of the previous and the now defunct autonomous region in muslim mindanao  armm  had asked the denr to issue an order stopping all destructive mining activities in the muslim autonomous region  in september   the barmm said it suspended all nickel mining operations in tawi tawi to pave the way for a review of the region s mining policy  but details of the review were not made public  the philippines is the world s second largest nickel ore producer in  after indonesia  with both southeast asian nations as the top two suppliers to china  the biggest buyer  latest available industry data show that   million wet metric tons  wmt  of high grade ore  or nearly  percent of   million wmt of the high grade material the philippines exported to china in the first half of  came from tawi tawi  cease and desist   tawi tawi accounted for  percent of overall nickel ore exports  totalling   million wmt  to china during the six month period  in   then armm assemblyman hanibal tulawie  then chairman of the committee on environment and ecology  said that a resolution was passed asking the denr to immediately issue a  cease and desist  order on all mining companies operating in tawi tawi and also in basilan  sulu  lanao del sur and maguindanao provinces after he received numerous complaints from the public and environmentalists who are opposed to destructive mining methods  photos of nickel mining operations in tumbagaan island posted on facebook also showed huge trucks and barges hauling off red soil  which was allegedly being shipped to china where it is processed  there were previous reports indicating that tumbagaan island was totally devastated because of mining explorations and the nickel mining activities there  the same thing allegedly happened to panglima sugala town  rehabilitation underway  then president rodrigo duterte  who was made aware of the mining devastation on the island  has ordered a stop to all mining operations in tawi tawi  then cabinet secretary karlo nograles said duterte was very much concerned about reports that tumbagaan island has been completely devastated by mining activities   the island has  at this point  been mined out  and while rehabilitation efforts are underway  the president is issuing a directive to stop any and all mining   he said  duterte ordered authorities to step up rehabilitation by planting trees in areas devastated by nickel mining  but surprisingly  duterte did not order an investigation into the mining in tawi tawi or who were the groups behind the environmental destruction  this is allegedly the reason why it was not acted upon by denr  particularly the mines and geosciences bureau  the denr earlier expressed commitment to review mining laws  including small scale mining  to ensure that standards are updated and that the provision of the implementing rules and regulations takes full advantage of remote sensing and innovation in artificial intelligence ,0

458,usapang natural calamity  ngo  and disaster management may mga takeaways ako sa nakaraang pagbaha  our country lacks civil defense infra  especially for flooding  this is also a result of decades of corruption  and negligence from national to lgu  the ultimate victims of these corruptions are the people  i hope the current government and its successor would give weight to the importance of anti flood infra  especially in mindanao  it s not enough that we should only restore our woodlands and forests  we also need actual infra  it should continue to be developed until it becomes a way of life and a sophisticated system  pbbm showed us how to both calmly and intelligently lead in times of disasters  there are things beyond our control  there are also things that can be mitigated  pbbm s frustration of the not so good effect of the calamity made him say the words   what happened   this question that he deliberately said to the public shows that his leadership is the type that finds oppportunities  for improvement  in bad situations  this is rca  root cause analysis   pbbm  as a pro active leader  does rca to find out what could have been wrong  or what could have been done better  this is a common trait in the leadership of big companies  and it also applies in government management  leaders who want to  please  the people would cover the opportunities for learning with  good  image like highlighting the good parts to hide the bad metrics  but leaders who want to  lead with better result  are not afraid to discuss the areas of opportunities  it is dangerous to sugarcoat opportunities with glossy pr photos or  photoshoot of charities  when you do not address the root cause of the problem  being reactive during disaster aims to cure the defect when it happens  our government already has a lot of agencies to do the  reactive  management  it is a risky and dangerous form of management  but it is still needed  in fact  we have government offices to do the dirty and dangerous job   what makes our government agencies better is the fact that they are both reactive and pro active  example  the dpwh  dpwh creates infra for flood management to cushion the impact of future disasters  at the same time  they manage destroyed infra to cure an actual disaster related damage  for ndrrmc  they are also both pro active and reactive  they are pro active in the sense that they conduct civil training to people on how to self manage fire  flood  or earthquake  this will equip the people the knowledge on how to manage these disasters  they are also reactive in the sense that they are the first responders to calamities and casualties  being reactive is part of disaster management  that s the most dangerous part  i have never seen any private foundations doing the actual rescue done by the ndrrmc and military who even shed blood and offer their lives just to help  the doh and dswd are both reactive and pro active too  aside from the proactive and reactive management  i think i need to add one  this is the auxiliary layer  this may include private ngos who offer optional support to the needy  their help are much appreciated  but with or without these private ngos  the government  headed by the presisent  is still obliged to do the dirty and dangerous tasks  private ngos  relief goods and distribution of food that could last for a few days and often do not give permanent cure to disaster damage are often superficial and sometimes marred with controversies  as it can also be used as a political tool or can be weaponized to advance a political agenda  private ngos are appreciated as auxiliary  but let us also remind ngos to do their mission silently and outside the prying eyes of the public to avoid controversies  let us not use disasters and suffering to make us feel good that we are helping  publicizing the help of ngos  during  disasters and suffering should be their  last priority  or should not be necessary at all to avoid the impression that they are using disasters to  show that they are helping   helping the people silently should be the priority over validating themselves that they are helping through photoshoots  pr  and self promotion amidst the suffering of the people  report to stakeholders  of these private ngos should be done during board meetings and notice letters  not through publishing endless photoshoots  during  calamities  when in fact  our government  lead by the president  is the actual force who did the proactive  reactive  and the dirty job  so that these auxiliary private ngos are safe to give optional support under the convenience provided by government agencies like the military  ndrrmc  etc  pbbm is the leader who asked the question publicly  what could have been wrong   this is a quality of a leader who is not afraid to dig the root cause of the problem  knowing the root cause of the problem would help leaders address it  it will also aid them to study   develop the best solution  private ngos during calamities do not necesarily do the hard part of the proactive and reactive management  many exist as auxiliary optional help  but not required  any help that they could offer silently are well appreciated though  their optional help can still aid many people  especially if the help was offered during the most inconvenient part of the diaster like giving support to the military during their actual disaster management  providing food to unsung heroes of ndrrmc doing the actual rescue  providing dignified houses that could last a lifetime to those who lost their homes  purchasing a parcel of land to be awarded to those who lost their propeelrties due to landslides or erosion  or giving financial aid to farmers who lost their crops with an amount that is high enough to recover their losses  sana ganito ka substantial ang tulong wishful thinking lang naman  sana hindi po puro pa cute pa distribute ng sardinas at  kilos of rice na naka supot  in your opinion  do you know a private ngo who self promote themselves amidst suffering of the people  or take a lot of photshoots to show the public that they are helping to gather public validation  but under the convenience and safety provided by the pnp  military  lgu  or other government agencies  do you also know ngos or a friend who does do not post photos  but was ready to help  how about ngos or people who even sacrificed their lives just to help without their photos taken ,1

problem shared by everyone  no matter our political color  and we should all work together to combat what we already have   she told the audience  and while fact checking is necessary  robredo lamented it as  inadequate    instead of engaging in hyper politicized debates about individual issues  lies  and myths  we must pull back and situate each lie within the bigger process of disinformation we must expose  so to speak  how the sausage is made  and talk about who is benefiting from disinformation  who is benefiting in every story  in every lie that is being said  and what is the agendas  what are the motivations   she said  she offered solutions  which are grounded in the best practices of other countries  to the issue  taiwan s  fast  fair  and fun  strategy  maria ressa s suggestion to view disinformation as having an impact on human rights and protect data privacy and banning the surveillance advertising  and reforming social media platforms  the former vice president  who lost the  presidential elections  is in a short vacation in the philippines after spending months in the united states to attend speaking engagements in harvard university  where she was one of the hauser leaders  as well as the massachusetts institute of technology and the democracy forum of the obama foundation  she was also recently in zurich to speak at a conference hosted by the asia society switzerland  she will fly back to the united states on friday  dec    to deliver a series of talks at the asia society new york  the how institute in new york  princeton university  tufts university  northeastern university  and bentley university  cornell university and georgetown university have also extended invitations to her  but she is yet to confirm if these will fit her schedule   and the reason why i m telling you this is that these invitations are a clear indication that the eyes of many around the world are on the philippines   robredo said   those whom we have engaged have shown particular interest in disinformation and influence operations in the philippines  we are  after all  considered unfortunately ground zero for such a phenomena   she added  the former official shared that the philippines is considered a  petri dish  for  those who weaponized social media to spread lies  control the flow of information  erode our trust in each other and in our institutions  polarize society  and dismantle the structures for meaningful public discourse   she explained that during her speaking engagements  she realized that people  want to understand how we arrived at the situation we are in right now  and why    they want to see what lessons can be learned from our experiences  and from there perhaps apply the same lessons to their own contexts  they are asking if we see a way forward  and to show them this way   robredo  one of the most victimized by fake news in the country  added  she described the purveyors of disinformation as being  organized  with a  set strategies and objectives    they are well funded  and they have shattered social media as a space for political discourse in the philippines   she lamented  robredo addressed for the first time the  len len  videos  which are supported by president ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  s sister  senator imee marcos  it is not only disinformation that the philippines is fighting against  but  influence operations   a term coined by professor jonathan ong  a sociology professor at the university of massachusetts amherst who wrote a groundbreaking study about disinformation in the philippines   yung  the  number two ang tawag niya dito sa  he calls in the  research  senator satirist   pero tatawagin na lang natin na  but we will just call  satirist  often in a position of access and power  who delivers coded attacks that can transcend fact checks   she said   kaya siya hindi nafa fact check kasi satire nga  pero familiar naman kayo dito   di ba   yung mga  len len  videos  they are not being fact checked because they are satire  but you are familiar with these  right  the  len len  videos    robredo added  the former official  however  shared hopes of a future free from disinformation   while more work remains on the horizon  the outcome even when narrow holds promise that the tide can be turned  when actions are rooted on promoting transparency and accountability in government and social platforms   she said   ,0

483,the appointment of prof  clarita carlos as national security adviser of the incoming marcos admin and her subsequent announcement that redtagging will be a thing of the past under the marcos administration has been a welcome news for leftist groups and their sympathizers  while it is true that the critics of the ntf elcac were waiting with bated breath how former ntf elcac spokesman lt  gen  parlade will react  perhaps anticipating he will go gaga over prof  carlos statement about ending redtagging  to the chagrin of the general s critics  he has nothing but good words for prof  carlos  in fact  he agreed with prof  carlos that redtagging should be put to rest because the  has already awaken  but before that  the retired general talked about reviewing his books while taking master studies in ateneo and in australia  parlade remarked that after reading  he realized not much has changed especially those concepts on economic development by a certain feliciano fajardo  the takeaway from the fajardo s books is that if the philippines don t reform  our democracy will die  he urged filipinos to understand how the communists duped filipinos into thinking redtaggging is the issue which is not  parlade said our problem as a people is that we are ignorant of their revolutionary dual tactics  parlade went on to elaborate what he meant by this  for example  the communist talks of peace and yet bait us in violence  they claimed to be activists yet they are engaged in the armed struggle  the retired lt  general ended the fb post by telling those people who rejoiced at the appointment of prof  carlos and her subsequent statement to just relax because redtagging  according to parlade will be put to rest because the  has already awaken  he warned that country s greatest problem or challenge is not within but outside the country  you may now read lt  gen  antonio parlade s original fb post below  sobrang galing at talino ng nadesignate ni pbbm na nsa na si prof clarita carlos  napa review tuloy ako ng ilang books ko sa masteral studies sa ateneo  us     and australia     i realized not much has changed especially those concepts on economic development by feliciano fajardo  if we dont reform  our democracy will die  so  let s understand how these communists duped us into believing that redtagging is the issue  it is not  it is our ignorance of their revolutionary dual tactics  they talk of peace yet bait us in violence  they claim to be activists yet they are so engaged in the armed struggle  they talk human rights but they are the most vicious  tortuous  and most murderous armed group  they speak of corruption in government but they are the most exploitive extortionists we have known  they profess to be pro poor but look at how their insurgency forfeited our funds for baranggay development and livelihood in favor of the wealthy  they speak of morals and humanity yet corrupt the minds of our youth to nurture hate against govt  dun sa mga kumunistang natuwa sa appointment at statements ni incoming nsa  chill muna kayo dyan  tutuldukan na natin ang isyung redtagging  sapagkat  na katao ang mulat na mulat na sa katotohanan  hindi na tayo babalik sa madilim na karanasan natin sa mga teroristang ito  mas matindi ang hinaharap natin sa rehiyon sa labas ng ating bansa  ,1
484,members of congress  and i m referring to both houses  are expected to craft laws which would best best serve the interest of the people  unfortunately  however  a group of lawmakers who were responsible for the enactment of republic act  not only betrayed the very people they have vowed to serve  but have even exposed all of us to security threats  last week  at a media forum  two prominent lawyers  larry gadon and ferdie topacio  assailed ra   also known as the  public service act   saying it was not only unconstitutional but also poses a threat to the country s economy and security  according to the two lawyers  the lawmakers effectively amended the constitution when they redefined public utility as public services so that the former term would now only refer to electricity distribution and transmission  petroleum and petroleum products  pipeline transmission systems  water and wastewater pipeline distribution and sewerage systems  seaports and public utility vehicles  with the public service act  airports  railroads  railways  subways  wire or wireless telecommunication services  and wire or wireless broadcasting stations are no longer considered as public utilities  thereby opening them up to  percent foreign ownership  the new law  gadon and topacio claimed  overturned what has been protected for almost a hundred years by all the constitutions adopted by the filipinos to govern the country  as the    and  constitutions have declared that public utilities which include airports  railroads  railways  subways  wire or wireless telecommunication services  and wire or wireless broadcasting stations  should have at least  percent filipino ownership and foreign ownership to be limited to  percent  in order to run around the constitutional provision  the two lawyers said  the lawmakers redefined the coverage of public utility by removing from it airports  railroads  railways  subways  broadcast stations and wireless telecommunication  but retained seaports  electricity distribution  transmission of petroleum and petroleum products  water distribution and sewerage systems  and public utility vehicles  by doing this  they have arrogated to themselves the power solely vested on the supreme court   the interpretation of the law  under this new public service act  the united states no longer needs to invoke edca  or the enhanced defense cooperation agreement  to put up military bases  they would simply put up their own airports over which they have absolute control and who knows what they would be putting out there  we have just become targets of whichever opponents the us might pick  but again no  maybe other countries could also put up their own military bases here in the disguise of commercial airports  and presto  we have just become their mini battlegrounds  why bring the war to their respective territories when they can do their battles here  thousands of miles away from their countries  actually  even when the bills were still being deliberated at the senate and the house of representatives before being signed into law by former president rodrigo duterte last march  lawyer ariel inton  president of lawyers for commuters safety and protection  had already expressed his opposition to the then proposed law  according to inton  proponents of the measure came up with a brilliant strategy of amending the constitution without resorting to legal processes  the proponents insist that we have to lift the nationality requirements for the industries which used to be listed as public utilities to attract foreign investors  however  inton said  a study revealed that it is not the nationality requirement which turns off these foreign investors  but the corruption  inadequate structures and bureaucratic red tape which are allegedly synonymous with setting up business here in the philippines  these  according to inton  are what should be addressed by the government  proof of this  according to the lcsp president  is the fact that even months after ra   there are still no foreign takers  but even with or without any foreign taker  the threat to the national economy and security remains  and that is aside from the fact it is in direct violation of the constitution  to remedy the situation  rj javellana  president of the united filipino consumers and commuters  filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the supreme court seeking to declare ra  unconstitutional  respondents to the petition are executive secretary lucas bersamin  senate president juan miguel zubiri and house speaker martin romualdez  in his petition  javellana said  the country cannot afford to leave these public services in the hands of foreigners whose interest or agenda may be detrimental to national interests   of course  but if i may add  we also cannot leave the fate of the country to lawmakers such as those who crafted the bills leading to ra  who view foreign interest as far superior to that of the people whom they have sworn to serve  it s been almost half a month since former media man benny antiporda was suspended as acting administrator of the national irrigation administration by the office of the ombudsman over some petty complaints filed by some disgruntled employees of the agency  but up to now  we haven t heard of any action from the ombudsman with regard to the graft cases filed by antiporda against some nia officials  except maybe to ask for their counter affidavits in relation to the case  a legal procedure denied by the ombudsman to antiporda when they handed him his suspension order  to recall  a group of concerned nia employees filed a case against antiporda last november  and  days after  on november   the ombudsman s office  without furnishing antiporda a copy of the complaint and asking him to answer the said complaints  issued a six month preventive suspension against the acting nia administrator  signed by no less than ombudsman samuel martirez  acting on an anonymous complaint with haste  even suspending the respondent without according him any chance to refute or answer the allegations against him  and i had always thought martirez to be a brilliant legal mind  he was even appointed as associate justice of the supreme court before being appointed ombudsman  was he aware he was denying antiporda his basic right when he signed his suspension order without asking him to present anything to answer his accusers who  at that time  were nameless and faceless  take note that officers and members of the nia employees association of the philippines have categorically denied any hand in the filing of the complaint against antiporda  and on the contrary  even expressed support for him  isn t martirez courting impeachment  according to some lawyers i have talked to  the ombudsman could be liable for betrayal of public trust for the manner in which he handled antiporda s case  but then  they may be wrong as they might not be as brilliant as martirez    ,0

502,changing the  focus  of the fight against illegal drugs  president ferdinand marcos jr  said he had told the philippine national police that he was  not interested  in small time drug pushers and instructed officials to put more effort into going after big time narcotics suppliers and distributors  marcos said on friday that he gave the order during a meeting with top pnp officials after he took office on june   succeeding rodrigo duterte  whose brutal war on drugs is under investigation by the international criminal court  icc  prosecutor     it is certainly my view that enforcement  which has been the part of the drug war that has been most vigorously pursued by president  duterte  only gets you so far  and my approach is slightly different   marcos told a forum with the asia society on friday at the close of his six day us visit    my first command conference with our policemen  i said we will adjust  let us adjust our focus   as to the enforcement  to put it very bluntly  i simply told them   look i m not interested in the kid who makes  a week selling weed   that s not the person that i want you to go after   he said   i want you to go after people who  if we get them  if we neutralize them  or put them in jail  we put them away  whatever it is  we will make an actual difference so that the supply of drugs  the system of distribution  the system of importation of drugs because much of it really does come from abroad  that will actually make a difference  it will put a stop to it   marcos said  duterte s anti drug campaign has led to thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings whose victims were mostly impoverished suspected drug pushers and users who were gunned down during police anti drug operations  the philippine drug enforcement agency reports that a little over   people had been killed in the drug war since   human rights groups say the number was closer to    data from the independent monitor dahas ph  whose members are mostly from the university of the philippines third world studies program  have shown that duterte s drug war consistently targeted small time pushers  failing in its promise to bring down so called high value targets   new war on drugs  toward the end of his term  duterte admitted that he was unable to end the country s drug problem  which he promised to get rid of in three to six months after taking office in june   he said his self imposed deadline was just a campaign  hubris   adding that he was  really wrong  in making the promise  after he won the elections in may  marcos said duterte told him to continue the controversial anti drug campaign  in an interview with vlogger toni gonzaga earlier this month  the president said the war on drugs would continue  but it would be waged in a different manner    he said there were  working groups putting together the new war on drugs   marcos emphasized measures for drug prevention and rehabilitation of drug addicts   more sensitive  the government s drug rehabilitation program has to be  more sensitive and more sympathetic to those who actually have gotten caught up in this lifestyle   pull them out of that culture and to help them start again and do live a good life as good and contributing members of society   he said  at the forum in new york  marcos said   we cannot stop the drug war  the problem continues to exist  what we can do is to examine and learn lessons from the experience from the past administration   the president said last week that icc investigators need not come to the philippines to look into the alleged crimes against humanity committed by his predecessor and other officials in the drug war  the only way that the icc investigators would be welcomed into the country would be  if the whole system collapses  or  if we have a war here   marcos said  he also said the country would not rejoin the icc  which it left in march  by withdrawing from the rome statute  the treaty that established the tribunal based in the hague  netherlands  on icc probe marcos said the icc should not intervene in the country s domestic affairs   the alleged crimes were all committed in the philippines  they were all committed by filipinos  why will we need a foreigner to tell us how to deal with it   he said in an interview with the newly launched alltv network of billionaire manuel villar  duterte ordered the withdrawal of the philippines from the icc after its prosecutor opened in february  a  preliminary examination  of allegations of crimes against humanity committed by the former president in his drug war since his days as mayor of davao city   although the philippines withdrew its membership from the icc in march   taking effect one year later  the icc said it had jurisdiction over the country until march   under article  of the rome statute  a state  shall not be discharged  by reason of its withdrawal  from the obligations arising from this statute while it was a party to the statute  including any financial obligations which may have accrued   ,0

536,the bbm dilemma  how the west might strangle him  part  of   in part   i wrote about the domestic issues that might affect the internal legitimacy of president bongbong marcos  read  https   tinyurl com    in this part  i will discuss what pbbm is doing well in terms of beefing up his external legitimacy  and the crisis he might face in terms of foreign policy    let me repeat the difference between internal legitimacy an and external legitimacy  internal legitimacy depends on the trust and confidence citizens have on their leaders  external legitimacy comes from the recognition from other heads of states  multilateral organisations  international civil society organisations  and global public opinion  a leader need both in order for him to have a stable government    for now  president bongbong marcos   pbbm  internal legitimacy is quite solid  elected with    with an overwhelming margin of about  million votes  pbbm s external legitimacy still needs to be built  no head of state has condemned pbbm   that s good news  but i can see that changing in the future    so far  pbbm is doing well in terms of diplomatic positioning  his choice of indonesia as the first country to visit is a diplomatic masterstroke  as i wrote earlier   pbbm s first state visit bears this deeper meaning  we must finally deeply embrace our easternhood  synthesise with it whatever good we inherited from our western colonisers  and integrate these two heritages into a strong identity that will give us that unique positioning among our eastern peers as we rise together as asia   read  https   tinyurl com      in his speech at the un general assembly  pbbm emphasised the duterte foreign policy doctrine   friend to all  enemy to none   signalling to the world that there will be continuity with his predecessor s foreign policy line  i just wish that pbbm also included his  trade not aid  foreign policy doctrine in his speech    pbbm s speech outlined four  transcendental challenges  the world is facing right now  climate change  development of advanced technologies  widening geopolitical polarities  and global inequalities   inequities  so far  so good    however  pbbm will face a foreign policy crisis  perhaps one of the most critical ones in his presidency   which will happen a year before the  national elections  this foreign policy crisis is the renewal of the generalised scheme of preference  gsp   with the european union    the philippines successfully applied for the gsp  deal with the eu in   this trade deal is set to expire by the end of december     through the gsp  deal  the philippines is able to export   different types of goods to the eu  duty free  in exchange of this  the philippines must commit to implement  international treaties which cover issues like labor rights  human rights  good governance  and environment    according to franz jessen  the former head of eu delegation to the philippines   an estimated php  billion worth of  exports were benefiting from gsp  trade preferences  especially in the food and agricultural sector  this makes the eu the philippines  second largest export partner  after japan and before the us and china   as you can see  the agricultural sector is one of the main beneficiaries of this trade deal   the flagship issue of pbbm    according to dti   gsp  also gives an impetus for foreign companies to invest in the philippines  a number of companies have established their manufacturing operations in the philippines in order to take advantage of gsp  benefits  thereby contributing to employment generation and the developmental goals of the country  these operations cut across a range of industries including electronics  agriculture  processed foods  apparel  craft goods  travel goods  and home appliances     to know how the foreign policy crisis might unfold  it s worth understanding the process of renewing the gsp  deal with the eu     the eu has a common trade policy  an eu member country cannot enter into a trade deal with a  third country   the term for non eu member state  on their own  this means that if you are a non eu country  for your products to be able to enter any eu member state  you have to negotiate with the eu as a whole    the eu commission  the executive body of the eu  negotiates these trade deals with third countries  the eu council  made up of the heads of states governments of the member countries  and the eu parliament must then approve the trade deal for it to be effective    since   members of the eu parliament have been warning that the philippines might lose its gsp  status because of human rights issues     in february   the eu parliament adopted a resolution with a vote    make several demands from the philippines  i would like to highlight the following  read  https   tinyurl com    a  allow the icc prosecutor to investigate in the philippines b  make the philippines a member of the icc again c  release leila de lima d  abolish the national task force to end local  communist armed conflict  ntf elcac    when the gsp  trade deal expires on  december   the bbm administration will have to negotiate its continuation  the eu parliament will have to approve the deal  it s not farfetched tha the eu parliament would press on the philippines on those four things    pbbm will definitely face this foreign policy dilemma in   give in to the demands of the eu parliament to continue the gsp  trade deal  or don t renew it and therefore affect industries that export to eu duty free  in this trade deal  the eu has the upperhand  it s a unilateral trade deal with the eu    the eu is the only one opening its markets for ph some exports  tariff free    either way  a crisis in our domestic politics will ensue  this might also be a crisis that the opposition needs in order to divide and conquer the marcos duterte political base in order to rise in the  national elections and beyond  it s also a crisis that the opposition has so much influence because the eu parliament composition has a lot of social democrat parties and liberal parties  the liberal party of the philippines and akbayan partylist are very much connected to them     if pbbm gives in to their demand  that would mean that he would have to allow the icc prosecutor to investigate in the philippines and surrender prrd to the icc if ever the prosecutor issues a warrant of arrest  if pbbm chooses to not continue the gsp  trade deal  he might face resistance from different industries  specifically the agricultural sector  that export to the eu through the gsp  scheme  the opposition will exploit this issue to the hilt in order to raise fears among our people and perhaps even encourage unrest   ,1

546,it s the optics  my friend  learn from franklin delano roosevelt  on september     philippine star published a photo of president bongbong marcos  pbbm  delivering his speech at the un  according to philippine star  they got the picture from the office the press secretary  ops   among all the photos from the ops  philippine start selected this particular picture  pbbm is not the focus of the picture  but the mostly empty seats at the un general assembly  unga  hall  a picture is worth a thousand words  the adage goes  and when one looks at this picture the words one would associate with it are all unflattering  in every story  there is a verbal and visual narrative  the verbal narrative of this photo requires understanding context  unga general debates are divided into two sessions   morning and afternoon  the heads of states do not usually attend the session where they are not scheduled to speak  they use their time economically  usually meeting bilaterally with other heads of states when they are not scheduled to speak  thus  the   unga hall is mostly empty as there are only limited number of speakers in each session  the rest of the heads of states are busy attending to other foreign policy function  after all  they were not at the un to listen to lengthy speeches  they were there to represent their country as the highest diplomatic symbol  in case of monarchs  or highest decision maker in terms of foreign policy  however  the moment you have to verbally explain an image after the fact  that s a sign that you have a problem in political optics  which is  the public s opinion and understanding of a situation after seeing it as the media shows it  and the possible political effects of this   cambridge dictionary   the selection of this photo has a purpose  and certainly it s not to make pbbm look powerful  the visual narrative  as opposed to the verbal narrative is simple  pbbm was ignored by a lot of heads of states when it was his time to speak  thus  reinforcing the  story  about pbbm that he is a weak leader  the emptiness swallowed pbbm and rendered him insignificant   leni s campaign had one bad optics after another  nothing beats the  hadouken  atrocity  later on the campaign  she explained why she did that  again  her verbal narrative of its context did not matter  in february     she said that it was for her supporters  they requested her to do it  so she indulged them as it was a  small price to pay  for their hardwork  obviously  even the verbal narrative was as much as a failure as the visual narrative  they both reinforced the story about her that she has poor judgment  a puppet  and thus not capable of being president   in the  optics  of political communication  dan schill summarised the findings of empirical studies on the impact of visual and verbal narratives      people believe what they see more than what they read or hear     when visual and verbal messages are in conflict  viewers have difficulty remembering the verbal information  and    visual messages override other messages when processed simultaneously   politicians who are aware of the power of optics often have  advance staff and event planners to create emotional and resonant images   schill emphasised  these images are those that reinforce a particular personality that make them look fit for the job  or images that reinforce that their deeds match what they preach   if a politician  for example  is pushing for austerity measures  it will not help him convince the public if images of him circulate doing lavish things  if a politician is selling a plan that requires being patient because their fruits come only after a long time  any image that shows them taking an opportunity to seek pleasure will not help them  delayed gratification is the essence of long term visions  you forego and resist the temptation for instant pleasures in order to enjoy a better or longer lasting reward  u s  president franklin delano roosevelt  fdr  is a very good example of delivering good optics  fdr was u s president from  to   his new deal policy helped the united states survive the great depression  and he successfully led his country to victory during world war ii   crippled by polio  fdr made sure that the american public didn t see his disability   in when fdr painstakingly walked to demonstrate his strength  sarah pruitt narrated that  strict white house rules prevented people from taking pictures of or filming him either in his wheelchair or being helped in and out of cars  roosevelt also worked very hard to develop a way of walking by using heavy leg braces and a cane  and leaning on someone else s arm a struggle he also did not want to be preserved on film    the u s  secret service often destroyed photographs of fdr in a wheelchair taken by journalists   fdr went to great lengths demonstrating that he could walk otherwise he would be perceived as weak  that was the brilliance of fdr  he knew his weakness and made sure that his visual representations to the public did not reflect being weak  in private  he was free to embrace his vulnerability  in public  he projects an image of strength  responsibility  and courage  managing the visual representation of the president may be adjudged as dishonesty and not being  transparent   but not every kind of transparency is good  presenting a head of state that

561, all that these rallies really prove is that yellowtard supporters are willing to dress in their pink best  get on a chartered bus  and scrunch together in a rally at the beck and call of their  leaders  on a sunday afternoon   from what started out as an estimated   strong crowd before sunset yesterday  the  official  estimate issued this morning  and amplified by mainstream media  ballooned to    in its  report  on the event  inquirer  reporters  jeannette i  andrade and krixia subingsubing further bumped up the estimate to    as expected  most participants in this rally wore pink   a reminder that theirs is an exclusive club of partisans who identify with a political brand  this latest  show of force  was impressive   impressive in how it demonstrates the resolve of a beleaguered political camp to send across to the public an unfounded perception that they are  winning   but are the yellowtards actually winning  this is the more important question  how many voters are the yellowtards actually converting  the most recent reports on voter preference polls issued by reputable research firms show that administration tandem bongbong marcos and sara duterte continue to maintain a formidable   very likely insurmountable   lead over the rest of the opposition candidates  pulse asia  reporting off the results of a survey conducted over the  through the  february showed marcos and duterte attracting  and  percent of survey respondents  preferences respectively  yellowtard presidential candidate leni robredo attracted a measly  percent while opposition vice presidential candidate exhibited a more respectable  percent of respondents  the recent publicus asia pahayag report made use of an even more recently collected sample acquired over the period  through the  march  this period would have likely captured any change in voter sentiment accounted for by successful yellowtard rallies conducted then  the fact is  however  there is no evidence that the proverbial needle had moved  the more recent publicus report remains generally consistent with the pulse asia numbers with marcos and duterte attracting  and  percent of survey respondents  preferences respectively  all that these rallies really prove is that yellowtard supporters are willing to dress in their pink best  get on a chartered bus  and scrunch together in a rally at the beck and call of their  leaders  on a sunday afternoon  as to the number of non yellowtards who would suddenly experience a miraculous change of preference and express this by doing the same  there is no reliable way of measuring how many people fit that story  in short  it is only a fool who would conclude on the bases of these  shows of force   impressive as they may be  that voters are being won from rivals  more importantly  the manner with which the yellowtards are trying to win over voters is intellectually dishonest  all of what they contribute to the national political chatter are no more than appeals to emotion  the colour  crowds  and  notably  the celebrities who perform for free at these rallies are targeting only one thing   an emotional response  even this far into the campaign  the yellowtards would be hard pressed to articulate clearly what their  movement  even stands for  they proclaim themselves filipinos   champions of democracy   yet show no evidence that said democracy is even being threatened to begin with  they claim on one hand to to be  in solidarity  with gay people and feminists yet  on the other  schmooze with the conservative roman catholic church whose members and honchos are dogmatically opposed to both  these bald inconsistencies are likely at the root of why a strong colour branding is being used in this campaign   to distract filipinos to the vacuousness and dishonesty of yellowtard ideology  with just a little more than  days to go in the campaign it looks like rallies like these are all the yellowtards really have to show the filipino voter  anecdotes of members of their lot  converting  their parents  their driver  their maids  and even their own children are being exchanged in yellowtard echo chambers  but if the polls are to be believed  even if all the rest of the opposition candidates stand down from their candidacies and back robredo as a  unified  force  marcos would still enjoy a comfortable lead  and if they lose these elections  there are indications that they have already thought that far ahead  one cannot put it past them to incite rumblings of another  people power revolution  that they hope would result in an illegal change in leadership  the yellowtards  quite simply  feel entitled to an electoral win this year as they are of the strong belief that god himself is on their side  for the sorts of people who think that way  any means justify the end ,1

582,social welfare secretary erwin tulfo on tuesday said   million filipino households had  graduated  from extreme poverty and would no longer receive conditional cash grants from the government  freeing up to  billion for new beneficiaries of the poverty reduction program  tulfo reported the plan by the department of social welfare and development  dswd  to delist these beneficiaries to president ferdinand marcos jr  during the third cabinet meeting of the new administration on tuesday  according to press secretary trixie cruz angeles    the number of beneficiaries to be delisted is more than  percent of the   million households which are recipients of the conditional cash transfer  or pantawid pamilyang pilipino program      this frees up  for other qualified persons to replace them and now be included in the  program   angeles said in a statement  in a phone interview with reporters  tulfo said the dswd made the move after he received a  marching order  from the president to review the conditional cash transfer program first implemented by the arroyo government and expanded by the aquino administration  he said the dswd was investigating   more households to determine whether they were still qualified to benefit from the program  which provides cash to the poorest of the poor families to help maintain essential nutritional needs  keep young children in school and obtain basic health care  asked what the president s reaction was to his report  tulfo said   he looked at me  surprised  he looked surprised   cleaning up the list but did mr  marcos support the planned delisting   yes   tulfo replied   it was his marching order to clean the  list    they are not considered anymore as poor   he said of the large number to be removed from the list of  beneficiaries  he said the dswd s national targeting office  which determines who are supposed to be included in the   only had  poor and nonpoor  on its list   if you are poor  you continue to be in the   once you are nonpoor  we have to take you out  if you are nonpoor  you are no longer qualified   he said    in a july  television interview  tulfo said that those who had  graduated  from the   can now stand on their own two feet    they can survive day to day and then their children  they may have graduated  so they are no longer qualified   the dswd chief said  the  poverty reduction strategy was institutionalized by republic act no   signed in  by mr  marcos  predecessor  rodrigo duterte  as a permanent government program  it would get yearly allocations from the national budget  the program is conditioned on the beneficiary families  commitment to achieve target outcomes in health and education  qualified beneficiaries include farmers  fishermen  homeless families  indigenous peoples  those from the informal sector and those living in isolated and disadvantaged areas  especially those without electricity  under the law  the monthly education grant is  per child enrolled in day care and elementary school for a maximum of  months a year  and  per child enrolled in junior high school and  per child enrolled in senior high school  a compliant beneficiary also receives a  monthly health grant and  monthly rice subsidy  according to the dswd  a total of   billion in cash grants was released to about   million households last year alone  the program as a whole provides  social assistance  in the form of monetary support and  social development  aimed at breaking the  intergenerational poverty cycle  by giving the poorest filipino families the means to invest in health and education   report the  unqualified  tulfo told the inquirer that he would ask the help of the public to clean up the list of beneficiaries by offering a reward to anyone who can give information about households or persons who are  beneficiaries but unqualified to receive the cash benefits  he clarified  however  that the reward system would not be implemented this month while the dswd scrutinized the  list  under the bounty program which may be implemented as early as september  a tipster can receive   for each nonpoor name he can provide to the dswd hotline or official facebook page  five names could earn the informant    but only if the dswd social workers verify them  dating back to arroyo years  this is to make sure that we are not leaving any people  who are not supposed to be there receiving money instead of the people who deserve the help   tulfo told the inquirer in a phone interview   we are just making sure that our list is real and clean  that the people receiving the ayuda  are the right persons who need the ayuda   he said  tulfo said the president will get a  clean  copy of the list once finalized by the dswd  but this could take weeks  the current list contains the names of beneficiaries from as far back as  during the arroyo administration  tulfo said  the  law states that the cash aid could be given to poor households for a maximum of seven years  tulfo said that the reward system could help save money for the government if the minimum   monthly that an unqualified beneficiary could receive were taken into account   an investigation team which tulfo will later form will verify an informant s tip with help from social workers   when we say  nonpoor   it means you can afford to buy home appliances  furniture  and then if you are a  beneficiary yet you can afford an air conditioner  then how can you afford that   tulfo said   ,0

general antonio parlade jr  in statecraft on  july   i asked him about this  you can watch the episode here  https   www facebook com forthemotherlandph videos   lt  general parlade responded   personally  i know that s the right thing for the government to do  specially knowing that president duterte has a personal experience with the leaders of the communist party way back when he was still mayor  so he was effectively able to maintain peace in davao city   duterte aimed to translate a local policy into a national policy by including communist recommended people in his cabinet  so for the very first time  the country was governed by a cabinet of communists and capitalists  in a way  this was also an experiment in how the parliamentary system works  in a parliamentary system  the party that got elected into power often doesn t get the majority votes  hence  in order for the top political party to govern  they have to form a coalition with other parties in order to be the ruling government   as a result of the coalition which is often between political parties of different ideological lines  the country moves into the center rather than into extremes  but for this to work  compromise is necessary  duterte s offer was so generous not only because there was no peace treaty yet  the communist party of the philippines  as represented by their legal fronts in congress  doesn t command a sizeable number of votes  they have support but it s not that significant   the political power of the communist party  to use mao tse tung s words  mainly  grows out of the barrel of the gun   as followers of mao s line of thinking  the communist party of the philippines takes this to heart  that s why they have an armed group called the new people s army   as jose maria sison wrote in philippine society and revolution      revolutionary base areas and guerrilla zones must be created in the countryside first  it is here where the enemy has to be defeated before the final seizure of power in the cities  the new people s army shall advance wave upon wave over a protracted period of time to destroy the enemy in the whole country   the capability of the communist party to use violence to advance their interests   personal or ideological   is the reason why they are being taken seriously by philippine politicians  however  as we all know  duterte s experiment failed   all those duterte appointed weren t confirmed by the commission on appointments  the communist party and its supporters blamed duterte for this  they didn t think duterte used his political capital to lobby for the confirmation of their people   but why would duterte use his political capital for them if they didn t reciprocate his generosity  they used the peace talks and ceasefires as a moment to recruit for and further consolidate their armed wing  just like they had always done  the communists are stuck in lenin and mao s approach to politics  they still believe that their political power would continue to grow through the power of the gun  duterte gave them an opportunity to govern  to show people how their policies could work even within a capitalist system  just like how socialist policies work well hand in hand with capitalism in scandinavian countries and other european countries  they are stuck in the idealism of mao and failed to transition to the pragmatism of deng xiaoping  they don t just want power  they want to have absolute power   and this absolute power could be achieved by seizing power  not through democratic means  but by overthrowing the government  whoever at its helm  and by replacing it with a dictatorship  under the communist party of the philippines   they want everything  and because of this  they get nothing and the government is left with the only option of totally eradicating them just like what suharto and lee kuan yew did in indonesia and singapore  respectively  if duterte can t achieve peace with the communists  no one else can  no president could have given them a better opportunity than duterte  the people the communist party of the philippines recruit to fight for their armed wing are suicide missions  military victory can never be achieved by the communist party of the philippines  so while the children of the high ranking members of the communist party of the philippines enjoy the fruits of capitalism   here in the philippines and abroad   their young  poor  and marginalised members are sent to their deaths for a mission that can never be accomplished  if a mission cannot be accomplished  it has to be abandoned  why the top leaders of the community party of the philippines aren t abandoning the mission is a combination of idiocy and greed  the latter seems more plausible  those at the top enjoy a life of privilege sustained by the influx of cash from revolutionary taxes collected through the bandits of the npa and donations from abroad channeled through their legal fronts  the communists have failed   they have failed to seize power and  more significantly  they have failed to establish a business model that follows socialist structures  the latter is worth emphasising  in almost half a century of its existence  the communist party of the philippines has failed to establish a competitive business model that is fully owned by workers like that of mondragon in basque  spain   while mondragon wasn t really established by communists  it s the most successful socialist enterprise in the world  mondragon has successfully competed against firms that are capitalists in structure  in which the workers don t own the means of production  mondragon is the  largest company in spain and the leading company in the basque region  survey the top companies in the philippines and you would never find anything like mondragon  mondragon didn t wait for a communist revolution to succeed in order to become successful  it effectively organised itself within the context of a capitalist system  mondragon follows a fair wage distribution between workers and managers  workers participate in decision making  workers  wages are higher than jobs in other similar enterprises   so why did the communist party of the philippines and other socialist groups failed to establish something like mondragon in the motherland  why they have not succeeded in creating an alternative successful business model that could compete with traditional capitalist ones  why they haven t parlayed the revolutionary taxes they got into establishing such enterprises   it s because their leaders are infected by the same political virus that infects a lot of our politicians  they build castles in the imagined perfect context of the future through their inane motherhood statements rather than do something that is implementable in the imperfect context of the here and now  the revolution the communists need isn t the protracted people s revolution they are selling to the public that entices young people to die for a mission impossible  the revolution they need is a revolution of the imagination  the communists should abandon the armed struggle  period  they should campaign for a shift to a parliamentary system that would serve as a fertile ground for diverse ideologies to debate policy direction and implementation  and they should start creating alternatives to the capitalist system by instituting successful enterprises that are worker owned rather exploit people s desperation and fool the youth of our country that overthrowing the government is going to create heaven on earth   well  a lot of the children of the high ranking members of the communist party of the philippines are already enjoying heaven   in capitalist countries in europe  and some in the united states  the country they despise the most  they enjoy capitalism to the fullest extent  while their comrades suffer and die in the philippines   ,1

611,must read reposting from lt gen  ret  parlade  what s on my mind  the letter of fr bobby to ateneo community  dear fr bobby  kumusta ka  majority of my kids are ateneans so i would like to respond to your letter as a father first and as a filipino next  before i answer your first few questions l want to agree with you that indeed we had a divisive election  a very divisive one  what happened and why it happened  simple  you  the jesuits  are partly to blame why our people are much more fragmented now  don t search for these answers from our leaders and our citizens because you know it  did we allow our students to forget history  oh no  fr bobby  they remember  but all they remember from your lessons of  years was martial law and the strongman marcos  and how the family pillaged the country as it brutalized all those who opposed his rule  they remember those who fought for  freedom  like the members of bayan  bayan muna  gabriela  kmu  act  tf detainees  km  kabataan  anakpawis  karapatan  akbayan  cnl  anakbayan  and many more   most important of all they remember the  l  sign and what it stood for  laban  the yellow cult is very much alive and the poison runs in their veins   yes  fr bobby you taught them to hate the marcoses that much and that they should do everything to prevent their return at all cost  you succeeded  as far as the ateneo community is concerned  but  you failed miserably in genuinely reaching out to the  poor  the powerless  and those in the laylayan   i say genuine because that house to house that you did have not transformed them into more productive citizens  not even during the administration of several aquinos  the homilies that you delivered have not convinced them they will be better off with the return of the yellows  they are not color blind and these people that the pink camp mocked are not deaf either  they sense the hypocrisy of your  leaders  even as the rc church aggressively endorsed them  they compose the majority of the  who believe that another six years of a duterte type leader will usher them to better life  that s what you missed while in the comfort of your lavish homes  so what happened fr bobby  well  the duterte government  no matter how you hate him  showed these ordinary people the change that you will only speak of  lip service is no longer acceptable and the people in the laylayan felt it  are we so naïve to not realize that even as president duterte is about to step down  his acceptance and popularity is still shooting above the roof  explain that to the ateneans father  in layman s language  not with all your rhetoric of moral values and the search for truth  the truth is right in your face and you refuse to see it  do you still want people to believe that  the task of alleviating poverty is a marathon  and not a sprint   people are drowning and we have to save them now  i am writing this letter while in hanoi  is this relevant  of course  here is how   the year  was when north vietnam supported by its communist allies attacked south vietnam in a violent war that ended with the us losing the war and leaving the ravaged country in   the communists were winning in laos  kampuchea  cambodia   and were encroaching in malaysia  indonesia  singapore  south korea  and thailand  the philippines around that time was also being threatened by the partido kumunista ng pilipinas  pkp  especially after jose ma sison organized his own faction  the cpp in december   the following year  in march   sen ninoy aquino helped establish the new peoples army from dante buscayno s ragtag group of bandits in tarlac  also in march   sen aquino exposed oplan merdeka  taking sabah  through his privilege speech on that fake jabidah massacre in corregidor  in the process he got the support of tungku abdul rahman  premiere of malaysia  in organizing  training  and supplying arms and war materiel to the secessionists lead by the lp stalwarts of mindanao  alonto  midbantas  lucman  dimaporo  and prof missuari  they composed the series of batches      of the mnlf  which the british sas trained with the gurkhas  eventually in   the mnlf split from the mim of datu udtug matalam  who was founded earlier in        these were the years the secessionists and the cpp npa rebels were born  to fight and bring down the marcos government  did anyone teach our students what sen aquino was trying to do during those times  was he fighting marcos dictatorship when there was none  or did he perpetuate the violence with the organization of these armed groups which forced marcos to declare martial law  no  nobody wants to tell these part of history especially as it clearly identified sen ninoy as a traitor to his country  but he did die in the tarmac  after he returned to malaysia to seal his treasonous commitments with the malaysian leaders  so he was labeled an  icon of democracy  instead  meantime  did you teach our students what was happening in and around the philippines  which necessitated the  legal and constitutional declaration of ml by marcos  in order to stave off the attacks of the rebels  no  we only taught our students what happened during the ml  especially the  brutality  of the afp as it tries to fight those who armed themselves to fight the government and destroy our democracy  in collusion with the communists in our midst  and then we memorialize the death of these traitors to our democracy by carving their names in that wall we fondly call  bantayog ng mga bayani   we cant force our students to remember history not taught to them  yes  let us not give up on our country because its the only one we got  peace na sana tayong lahat  lt gen parlade  ret ,1
612, leni robredo s revelation that she consults a lot with catholic priests is a red flag  catholic priesthood is western civilisation s most ancient boys  club  to be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned   the only thing opposition partisans can say about abs cbn personality boy abunda s interview of leni robredo is that he  interrupted her a lot   that s actually not true  abunda was constantly trying to steer robredo back on topic and  in most cases  reiterating the question of the segment  the trouble with leni robredo is that she was too reactive to abunda s questions which were evidently designed to test the breadth and depth of context that his interviewee would be able to apply in his or her response  an example of robredo falling into this trap is her responses to abunda s questions on how to pay the national debt  in reality  no one president can  pay  the national debt  it can  under his or her watch within his or her term  be serviced and managed to certain economic and fiscal parameters  this is part of the day job of the secretary of finance  rather than stammer through a lame attempt to answer what was clearly a trick question  robredo could have simply responded by saying the above   that debt servicing be kept reasonable  that debt levels be managed within the frame of forecast economic performance  and that she will work closely with her economic and fiscal managers to achieve these debt management goals  easy  right  the most awkward segment of the interview   one that robredo visibly struggled with and where the profound inconsistency of the ideological underpinnings of her campaign became apparent   was abunda s question on abortion  abortion is a cornerstone of the feminist movement  feminists are big on this whole  my body my choice  thing  considering that robredo s  pink  campaign theme panders to the feminist community  it is clear that she is allowing her personal catholic faith to cloud her judgment  indeed  robredo s revelation that she consults a lot with catholic priests is a red flag  catholic priesthood is western civilisation s most ancient boys  club  to be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned  this is the whole trouble with the yellowtards  they claim to be liberal and presume to be chummy with the gay community and the feminist movement  however  the yellowtards  top leaders are also outwardly prayerful and schmooze a lot with catholic bishops and priests  the roman catholic church is clear on its position with regard to homosexuality and the sorts of liberal lifestyles and pro choice philosophies espoused by the gay and feminist communities  all of these run counter to catholic dogma which is deeply incompatible with liberalism  robredo herself admitted in the interview that she finds herself  conflicted  by all this  this is disturbing considering that the philippines aspires to join the ranks of modern liberal democracies that host societies where tolerance for diversity of lifestyles and life choices is paramount  the roman catholic faith is not compatible with this aspiration and robredo  being a professed devout catholic cannot claim to be an authentic liberal in this regard  fish are caught by the mouth and robredo had bitten the proverbial hook and was effectively reeled in out of her depth and found herself gasping for oxygen  perhaps her yellowtard followers should  instead  be thanking boy abunda for interrupting her frequently  if he didn t  robredo could have made an even bigger fool of herself and damaged further her already floundering campaign ,1

616,a bit of political law for the rainy days the reason and purpose for having a cabinet   with all the cabinet secretaries  undersecretaries and assistant secretaries   is to allow the head of the executive  president  to delegate his functions to people who are ready  willing and able to do just as if he were the one doing them himself  the cabinet officials are not autonomous  they are just delegates or qualified agents  as it were  as such  they don t have inherent powers  the only power they have that may be properly attributable to them is the ability to think  everything else is delegated and would ultimately be reviewed by the president  so  if cabinet officials are incapable of thinking on their own  aka morons   the delegated powers would be for naught  they would be left undone  and the jobs  functions and official obligations they leave ultimately rebound to the president  which  to me  is a sorry case of renvoi  that would then saddle the hapless president with all of the stuff that he was supposed to be unsaddled by the appointment of delegates  it is sorry and dismal and sad  that is why we  the people  should be vigilant and critical of people appointed to the cabinet  because they are supposed to be unburdening the president by virtue of their appointment  and not unduly saddling him with and by virtue of their idiocy   ,1

624,madness and statecraft  we all know that pbbm is a gentle person  as we had seen during the campaign  he can still retain that gentleness  but he has now to show more the hidden dragon in his crouching tiger  unleash his madness   even during his campaign  former president rodrigo duterte s brand has always been a no nonsense come hell or high water guy  his brand has always been  peace and order is the foundation of development   he started his presidency with shock and awe  it s a military strategy to show an overwhelming display of force to influence perception and undermine their will to fight  in street parlance  it s  kwelyohan   we witnessed a whole range of effective emotions from him  specially anger    and they were imbued with authenticity  both his supporters and detractors were on their toes  anticipating and guessing what he would do next  he kept us all alert  awake  and even some felt afraid  do you remember the first few months of his presidency in which he kept all of us awake after  am  so we could wait who he would name in the infamous list of officials involved in the shabu trade  he opened that by naming five generals  that was his opening salvo  the commander in chief calling out his men for their alleged dastardly acts  prrd also gave an impression that he seemed like a  volatile  leader  even gave an impression of  madness   he was mad  definitely  and was never afraid to show it   in the discourse of livy  machiavelli pointed out that it is very wise thing to do to simulate madness at the right time  in game theory  this is called the  madman theory   we are all rational beings    meaning  consciously or unconsciously weigh the costs and benefits of our action  prrd gave an impression that he was working against his interest  he doesn t care if what he would do would cost him the presidency or if it would make him look less presidential  he was not even to go to jail  that s what endeared him to a lot of filipinos  here s a man working against his self interest in order to advance national interests  that s the reason why he left office with the highest trust rating among all philippine presidents  whether or not it was tsismis or truth that he killed people is not the point  whether or not it was true that he made a foreigner eat cigarette butts in davao city for violating the anti smoking ordinance does not matter  what mattered was the people have been instilled this belief that he might do it    so as a self interested individual  you are deterred  that is the art of deterrence  to discourage someone from doing something by instilling doubt or fear of the possible consequences  and the consequence he often mentioned is the most extreme one  death  remember how one mayor allegedly involved in the drug trade escaped the philippines and never returned  while you yourself is afraid  you also feel safe because you know that others would also be afraid to do something stupid  nagtabaan ang mga dating adik sa kanilang lugar was an often joke i hear from filipinos living in the netherlands   every leader has to determine for themselves what s urgent and what s merely important  the urgent takes precedence  for prrd  it was peace and order  pbbm s urgent matter is food security  both are  malapit sa bituka   the problem is  peace and order issue is the one commonly associated to being a  commander in chief   pbbm s task is to make food security a matter that must be taken up by the figure of the  commander in chief   and the operative word there is not  chief  but  commander   instead of hearing others saying  the president ordered x  y  z   the people must see and hear more that it was pbbm ordering it  pbbm s critics will definitely target the attention he is pouring into the urgent task of  food security   in the game of perception  out of your mouth will make people in general think it is out of you mind  and thus you would be vulnerable to accusations that you are neglecting other urgent issues  the other urgent issue that s being floated is  peace and order   and again  in the game of perception  if it s out of your mouth  people will think you are neglecting it  we all know that pbbm is a gentle person  as we had seen during the campaign  he can still retain that gentleness  but he has now to show more the hidden dragon in his crouching tiger  unleash his madness  the time horizon of the electorate is very short because we change presidents every six years  that s why they are impatient  they want action after action because six years is nothing but just a sneeze  this very short term for a president compresses time and space  making people believe that you can change things in just a short amount of time  in other political systems  the government has a longer time horizon because they can get re elected  that s why they understand more that for change to take root time is a long road  that s why prrd s six years had been appreciated so much by a lot of people  there was never a down moment in those six years  there were also perceptible changes  just take note of the anti smoking executive order of the president  it was a very

628,  the catholic church locally has allowed itself to be whored out by a desperate political party that keeps changing its name since they destroyed what they used to have   this pm came to me the morning of march     a not insignificant group of some  lay christian leaders heeded the call  they organized themselves and discerned together the best senatorial candidates to support among the  contestants  since  these christian leaders from the catholic  evangelical and protestant persuasions have come up with gabaykristo  a set of christian criteria by which to measure the politicians  they researched the stance of the  candidates on various important national issues  they got the profiles of the candidates and they met several times to set up the criteria for screening the candidates  this is a serious kind of discernment circle that the bishops have been calling out  they call themselves the people s choice movement  pcm   they came out with two layers of screening  the first screening is to vet the candidates on two know out issues  belief in god and federalism charger change  they believe that a person who does not have the fear of god in him can easily abuse others  they also believe that the present state of the country is not ready for federalism and charter change   candidates were eliminated on these two knock out issues  the  candidates who remained in the pool were then subjected to the second screening  they were rated using criteria based on gabaykristo  a guide of  specific questions which are divided into four categories   character   honor competence   abilities  faithfulness to public service  faithfulness to god  the constitution and the laws  each of the  questions was graded from  to    being the lowest and  the highest  the ten candidates with the highest scores were declared the selected candidates  the following  in alphabetical order  were the selected   best senatorial candidates that our country   people need during these times        alejano  gary   aquino  bam   cominares  nery   diokno  chel   gutoc  samira   hilbay  pilo   macalintal  romy   poe  grace   roxas  mar   tanada  erin our lay leaders  with the people s choice movement  have done their work of discernment  now is the task for all the lay faithful to campaign the deserving candidates so as to counter the money and the political machineries that the trapo politicians are using  there are still two months for all to do this particular exercise of the christian faith  bishop broderick pabillo march     i replied  i don t care what he has to say and   name of friend   please feel free to block me at anytime  the catholic church locally has allowed itself to be whored out by a desperate political party that keeps changing its name since they destroyed what they used to have   i will give you some examples and please tell me where the bishops rationally explained the following  sereno who is not catholic in mass and with nuns  love this     yes use the catholic voter base   not bad for a person who is totally against  the sign of the cross  that is truly principled  i got this from thinking pinoy   samira gutoc  is prostituting the public worship of the mass to whore votes  somebody please show me where the bishops condemn or approve this  cheap attempt to appeal to multiple demographics  tolentino and the liberals in    why are they  bishops  so selective   maybe they were paid to be selective  when i look at this i can t help but ask what commandment was that    i am the lord your god  you should have no other  gods before me    what part in the bible    first  remove the beam out of your own eye  and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother s eye   the sins of one political group  are so invisible to them   galing     two years ago after attending mass i wrote this   whatever happened to separation of church and state  the bishops could care less about saf  or dengvaxia because their sponsors won t let them andy bautista  he only deprived the filipino of their vote   no condemnation from the bishops   none    good ateneo boy  ignores his sons and is hiding in the us  if i think inc block voting is a joke and abuse why is this any different   nowhere here did i say anything personal   to my friend   but you can not argue that for the bishops it s very personal   and if it s personal what does that have to do with god  end of my reply  march    my friend who sent me that bs  post  which is a thinly described liberal party ad paid for by the liberal party   had only one reply midway through my counter rant   hahaha  at any rate we can still make our our research and pray of course before we cast our votes   that thing she sent me does not ask for research  it claims to have done the research for us and expects us to be like sheep and follow their prescription  whatever that committee claims to be wanted those  people from the start  then they came  up  with some b s  formula to justify the  people they want  it is a lot like hiring a pinoy survey company  before you finalize the rate they usually ask what do you want the survey to say and you pay them to come up with the justification of what you want the survey to said  so that famous d strafford survey from three years ago  the only thing new was the name  the technique was not  look at their list   they are all silent on the following issues  none existent drug war pre   measures taken by that administration to limit the distribution of illegal drugs  dengavaxia    children dying from a state sponsored vaccine  and its funding  janet napoles connection with the previous administration  who should be responsible for the deaths of the    if anybody  what dap was used for and what was manipulated  in order to make dap possible  the constitutionality of dap  comelec s role in the validity of the  elections   the disappearance of andy bautista and funds in his possession not mentioned in his saln  do you know why they are silent on these issues   they only care about issues they can blame on duterte so that makes anything  they say personal   their list reeks of a personal vendetta  the catholic church officials are one with their candidates and have been for a long time and want you to believe these candidates have merits outside their clandestine relations  even during the previous term   they mostly turned a blind eye on the sins of the administration at that time  the catholic officials that did speak out against  the balding   bewildered  bespectacled  one were not offered main stream media coverage    weird how we can have truly defenseless children dying    yet this is the only evidence of the catholic church speaking for any kind of accountability     of course the list is endorsed by bam aquino   he who spent his entire term cosplaying the uncle he never met who he included in his initial bid for the senate  bam apparently is far more academically accomplished than his presidential cousin yet shares the same lack of originality  a google search i did using the terms   cbcp pastoral letter fake news  produced the results above  how charming  page  results are exclusively composed of rapple  abs cbn and the cbcp itself   a look into the rappler article dated june   shows that this humble website that i have been writing for since  is mentioned  the other websites they list all seem to defend the duterte administration and nor do they  list websites fiercely loyal to the yellow cause to the point they function as attack dogs   funny how rappler is not included in their witch hunt and is in fact spreading the fake news list  rappler faces a host of charges ranging from libel  foreign ownership and tax evasion  cbcp seems to be in too much of a rush to declare certain people fake news   if rappler is indeed guilty of dodging local foreign ownership laws wouldn t any of their publications by definition be fake news since they have a fake foundation  rappler like the cbcp  mouthpieces no not hide their political agenda very well  for both of them one side is flawless and one side is eternally damned   by favoring rappler  wouldn t they be in favor of media outlets who flaunt the local laws  the officials speaking for the catholic church go through a lot to hide their obvious bias towards the yellow movement whose last president was noynoy aquino  they are here to dictate to you politics not morality  they had very little in terms of public sermons for noynoy aquino even though he faced accusations of squandering lives and public money   they also feel extremely offended when their punching bag punches back  this is a personal fight  the bigwigs of the local catholic church want you to believe it is really about following god   i believe in god and i refuse to blindly follow some agenda filled vendetta disguised as a  work of  discernment   the local catholic church is more focused on kissing up to the liberal party than respecting their flock as children of god   if i was fond of blindly following people with a personal agenda who expect me to swallow their proclamations hook  line and sinker  i would read rappler ,1

msmes  that were just starting to recover  to dialogue with their employees so that they can meet halfway and come up with a winning solution to the problem  laguesma also gave his assurance that the labor department would not resort to extreme actions of closing companies that failed to pay their employees the mandatory  month pay because doing so would be at the disadvantage of the workers also   we will not close down companies that cannot afford to pay their workers their  month pay  we don t like to deprive the workers of their opportunities to get their rightful benefits and continue with their jobs   he said  the labor department  laguesma added  is in consultation with the department of trade and industry and the small business corp  about the  month pay loan facility they earlier initiated to help the msmes meet their  month pay obligation to their workers at zero interest and without collateral   we wanted to know if said loan facility is still open  we wanted to know the terms of payment   he added  the dole secretary said they fully sympathize with the situation of employers at present but  he pointed out  employers could not avoid paying their employees the  month pay   the problem is this is a statutory legal obligation  it cannot be waived  and it cannot be a subject of an exemption   laguesma also said  at the same time  he warned companies that have no valid reasons for not paying their workers   month pay on time  saying they might turn out paying their employees double the amount of what they should originally pay  under the thirteenth month pay law or presidential decree  pd    rank and file employees in the private sector shall be entitled to  month pay regardless of their position  designation or employment status  and regardless of the method by which their wages are paid  provided that they have worked for at least one month during the calendar year  the formula and computation of the  month pay is  total basic salary earned during the year divided by  months equals the proportionate  month pay  it shall be paid not later than december  of every year  an employer  however  may give to his or her employees one half of the  month pay before the opening of the regular school year and the remaining half on or before december  of every year  the frequency of payment of this monetary benefit may be the subject of an agreement between the employer and the recognized collective bargaining agent of the employees  exempted from payment of  month pay are the government and any of its political subdivisions  including government owned and  controlled corporations  except those corporations operating essentially as private subsidiaries of the government  employers who are already paying their employees   month pay or more in a calendar year or its equivalent at the time of the issuance of pd   persons in the personal service of another in relation to such workers  employers of those who are paid on purely commission  boundary or task basis  and those who are paid a fixed amount for performing specific work  regardless of the time consumed in the performance thereof  except those workers who are paid on piece rate basis  in which case their employer shall grant them  month pay   an employee who has resigned or whose services are terminated at any time before the time of payment of the  month pay is entitled to this benefit in proportion to the length of time he or she has worked during the year  reckoned from the time he or she started working during the calendar year up to the time of his or her resignation or termination from the service  sen  mark villar has filed a bill seeking to grant  month pay for contractual and job order personnel in the government service  in filing senate bill  sb   to be known as the   month pay law   villar explained that contractual workers  cos  and job order  jo  personnel play a vital role in government service   they fulfill their duties diligently and passionately comparable to permanent government employees  notwithstanding  they are not entitled to mid year and year end bonuses  such as the  month pay  among other benefits   he said  villar noted that job order and contractual workers do not receive benefits such as mid year and year end bonus that regular or permanent employees of the government get  during his stint as department of public works and highways secretary  the senator said he saw the needs of government employees and his appreciation of the situation prompted him to file sb    in light of the persistent rise in the inflation rate  which led to an extraordinary increase in prices of food  fuel and other commodities  filipino workers  including contractual and job order personnel of the government  face greater hardships in their lives  contractual and job order personnel lack security of tenure   according to the senator  villar said based on his bill  the  month pay of job orders and contractual workers should not be less than one half of their monthly pay   the passage of the bill should be done post haste  this will repay the services done by job orders to the government  the government knows how to repay the dedication and sacrifices of these workers this year   he explained   this bill supports the recent joint circular  of dbm  department of budget and management  and coa  commission on audit  extending the services of jos and cos until december    villar pointed out  he said he expects some   non permanent government workers to benefit from the passage of the measure by congress

657,while the robredo camp led by the ovp spokesman atty  barry gutierrez is filled with optimism that the   increase in leni robredo s rating in the latest pulse asia survey indicates what they called the turning of the tide  a dissertation put forward by a robredo critic attempts to douse cold water to the jubilant mood of the robredo camp  the dissertation of the robredo critic stated that leni robredo is nothing without the anti marcos vote  the author krizette chu of manila bulletin explained that her dissertation will show why leni s numbers can t breach the ceiling and why marcos is a constant variable in her campaign  basically  chu said that leni robredo supporters aren t really pro leni but rather rabidly anti marcos and anti duterte  chu s thesis statement are anchored on two things first  observation  second  numbers  with that said  chu implied that leni s chances of overhauling bbm s lead and scoring a come from behind victory is nil  you may now read chu s original fb post below  on her own  without the anti marcos vote  leni robredo is nothing a dissertation on why leni s numbers can t break the  very low  ceiling and why she really needs to keep mentioning marcos in her campaign  most of leni s supporters aren t decidedly pro leni  they re rabidly anti marcos  which is why she has a low ceiling and will not break that ceiling  so my thesis statement rests on two things first  observation  second  numbers  so on the first one  the soft leni but hard anti bbm vote  they re the ones who choose leni because bbm is the alternative  if leni doesn t win  bbm will  for example  i get to keep some of the the true and few leni supporter friends i have even when i am very rabid anti leni because they don t take offense when i criticize their bet  they don t take it personally  first  they re honest enough to say that leni isn t their ultimate bet but they have no choice because she is the frontrunner against marcos  had they a better choice  they wouldn t choose leni  but because she is the only candidate closest to bbm  they have to throw their support behind her to stop a marcos presidency  i get it and don t begrudge it  then there are those who are anti prrd  so they think leni is the only true opposition  how can she not be come off as only real opposition when all she did was oppose in the  years she was vp  the other bets at one time showed support for the prrd admin  lacson  isko  manny supported different facets programs of the current admin  lacson s atl  isko pre pandemic pre plans to join the race  manny with pdp laban  so the very few the ones who hate duterte and decided to hate him because they easily fall into propaganda without doublechecking  have decided to support leni  meaning  they have come into supporting leni late  and many don t love her the way the rabid loyalists love bbm  ps  do i think that a pro duterte can ever choose leni  no  i scoff at those who claim they support leni now but still support duterte  nope  not with the many roadblocks she put before this admin by continually opposing every single thing  not when she lied about our police before the un and embarrassed our country  not when she lied about coordinating with afp during natural disasters but apparently it was just some people and not the organization  all to push the idea that she s always the first on the ground which would be fine except in her frantic push for power she diminishes the frontliners on the ground who have been there even before storms hit  so many vote leni because they have no choice but leni  the numbers back this  in june   leni was one of the least favorites in the presidential preference surveys  hindi pa actual presidential surveys but preference palang  she only got  percent  sara was as we all know the frontrunner  followed by isko  bongbong  grace  and manny  leni was last  leni was last let that marinate during a time she had already showed off as the  first on the ground  during the pandemic another proof that she didn t have solid support  it took months for her own people and allies the  group  to declare their support for her  it took them months to decide between robredo and isko  that s how weak she was between june and september of   the presidential preference survey only showed a  percent increase from  to  percent  her number has slowly risen because the anti marcos vote solidified behind one candidate  many undecideds decided to back leni because they have no other choice  do they think she s brilliant  no do they think she s pure  no do they think she s great  no do they think she has the makings of a great leader  no  under her lp is a shadow of its former self and she couldn t even unite the opposition  they even lashed back at her  that is what leni has not a solid leni vote  just the anti marcos vote  the  percent from september is now at least  percent  ceiling of   percent before election  because she has the anti marcos vote  and this is ladies and gentleman the reason why the lady from naga cannot campaign without her anti marcos platform because she and her team knows that this is the only reason she even has the numbers to begin with  on her own  without the anti marcos vote  leni is nothing  o mamaya na ulit kain muna ako chicken rice   ,1

682,senate president juan miguel zubiri on monday indicated that he would support a move by other senators to ban philippine offshore gaming operators  pogos  following reports of serious crimes  including killings and abductions  that had victimized pogo workers from china  zubiri said he was having doubts about whether the small revenue from the pogos was worth it     on a personal note  we must weigh the social costs of pogo vis a vis the meager income they give to the national coffers of only  billion a year  plus  they do not employ filipinos  so there is no added benefit to our local labor force   he said  philippine national police chief gen  rodolfo azurin jr  also on monday said he had proposed several  safety nets  to deal with the spike in the number of crimes linked to the industry to sen  ronald  bato  dela rosa  a former national police chief and the senate public order and dangerous drugs committee chair  on sept    dela rosa s committee opened an investigation of the reported kidnappings and killings of pogo workers  zubiri said that senators would wait for the report of the committee before deciding on the proposal to ban these chinese run online casinos   so  the question is  is it worth it  that will be tackled during the presentation of the committee report of senator dela rosa   zubiri said  senate minority leader aquilino pimentel iii has already made up his mind to ban pogos  saying that allowing them to continue was  dangerous    that is akin to harboring would be criminals and gangsters that can eventually cause massive disruption of peace and order in the country as we are beginning to see now with the spate of kidnapping incidents and other violent activities related to pogos   he said  he called on malacañang to heed calls for a total ban on pogos as undesirable foreigners were turning the country into a  playground for crimes   sen  imee marcos  who also is against pogo operations  last week said she brought up the matter with her brother  president ferdinand marcos jr   but he has not yet decided on whether pogos should be kicked out of the country    she said she was initially in favor of pogos because the country was making money from them   that was then  but now  just like the  e sabong   its okay as a source of income but it is not commensurate to what we are paying for in terms of the crimes   kidnappings and abductions   she said  according to the philippine amusement ang gaming corp   pagcor   online gaming began in  and was unregulated  pagcor started to regulate gaming hubs in   the pogo business started to boom in  under president rodrigo duterte  who was then trying to curry favor from china  this was marked by the influx of thousands of chinese who entered the country legally and illegally to work in pogos  last week  authorities closed down a pogo company in pampanga province following the arrest of a chinese national and the rescue of  others who claimed they were abducted and forced to work in the gaming company  the pnp said on sept   that it had recorded  kidnapping cases so far this year   of which were pogo related  last month  authorities also rescued two thai pogo workers in mabalacat  pampanga  the two were alleged victims of human trafficking  entry requirements the pnp s proposed measures to deal with pogo linked crimes included imposing a requirement that pogo workers must show that there were no pending cases or arrest warrants against them from their home countries   we really don t know these people who are entering our country  they might be fleeing their country to hide from justice   azurin said  he also proposed monitoring all pogo workers upon their entry into the country   azurin said it was important that police and barangay officials knew where these workers were staying to enable authorities to check on whether they were abiding by the laws and ordinances in the country and to  keep track if they are paying the right taxes    all government agencies should work together to attract foreign investors and at the same time we do not sacrifice the security of every filipino   he added  pimentel urged congressional leaders to make the pogo ban a legislative priority  saying it was the  moral duty  of congress   we can t afford to dilly dally on banning pogos when the nation s moral fiber and peace and order are on the line   he said   we should act now  it will be a bipartisan measure   he added  he was referring to senate bill no    filed by sen  joel villanueva  which seeks to prohibit the conduct as well as the placing of bets on online gambling platforms  majority s call but the burden of passing a measure to ban pogos were on the senate majority  pimentel said   get your act together  if you say  stop pogo   we  will support you    pimentel said  quoting himself as telling majority senators  sen  grace poe  chair of the senate committee on public services  also backed a total ban on pogos  she cited recent findings of the ongoing inquiry which showed that the  social costs outweigh the economic gains  from pogos   if before  this industry was hounded by issues of nonpayment of correct taxes  mass migration and real estate bubble  now it is aggravated by the issues of kidnapping  prostitution  torture and even murder involving pogo workers   she said    it s like pogo as a mother vice gives birth to a whole slew of other vices and crimes   she added  finance secretary benjamin diokno last week said the government collected   billion from pogos at their peak in   but this dropped to

694,as mayors and governors now have the burdensome task of implementing programs and projects that otherwise should be done by agencies of the national government  president ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  called on local government units  lgus  to be open to public private partnership  ppp  as a mode of financing undertakings in their provinces  cities  and towns   i think this is the way forward  and i encourage all our  to be open to the possibilities of ppps  especially in your areas   he said in a brief meeting with officials of the league of cities of the philippines  lcp  in malacañang on tuesday    marcos administered the oath of office to new lcp officials led by its president  cebu city mayor michael rama  the president said infrastructure and digitalization were among the focus of his administration and lgus could join in implementing various projects through ppps   there are plenty of opportunities  especially in infrastructure  we have friends from various countries   especially the ambassadors who paid us courtesy calls   they are offering us a lot of help   he added   there s oda  there s private sector   joint venture   well  you re  local government  you know that already  local government generally cannot do it by itself  we have to find partners  we have to find local partners  we have to find investors  you re used to that   he told mayors  a ppp is a long term arrangement between a government unit and private companies  it usually involves using private capital to finance government projects such as toll roads  hospitals  and airports  and then allowing the private financiers to collect fees from taxpayers or users over the duration of the ppp contract  aside from helping cash strapped governments build much needed public infrastructure at no money outlay on their part  this can help lgus by tapping private sector expertise in undertaking big projects  starting this year  lgus will be handling big ticket programs and projects previously carried out by the national government  this followed the decision of the supreme court in  granting the petitions of batangas gov  hermilando mandanas and the late former bataan gov  enrique garcia jr  that the lgus  internal revenue allotment or ira  which is now called the national tax allotment or nta  should come from  percent of  all  national taxes not only from the bureau of internal revenue as was done in the past but also from the bureau of customs  collections of import duties and other taxes  the result is that for   lgus will be getting a record   trillion of the national budget through their nta  according to earlier estimates by the department of budget and management  in   this amounted to only   billion    faced with a smaller share of the overall tax revenues  then president rodrigo duterte signed executive order no   in early june  stipulating that the national government will  devolve  or transfer to lgus the implementation of formerly national government functions  it cited section  of the local government code of  allowing the transfer to lgus of local infrastructure  for education  irrigation  and trade   agriculture and natural resource management  environmental services  telecommunications  peace and order  social welfare  transportation  tourism  and housing services functions  in his meeting with the lcp officers  however  the president said he has formed a team headed by the department of the interior and local government  dilg  to look into issues of devolution and decentralization arising from the implementation of the mandanas garcia ruling  marcos recalled that he already had  extensive discussions  with mandanas and the late interior secretary jesse robredo on the devolution issue when he was chair of the senate committee on local government  contentious functions the original concept  he said  was to use the ira for the fourth  fifth  and sixth class provinces or lgus and provide assistance to provinces that operated hospitals but didn t have the funds  the remainder of the ira would be given according to the provisions of the local government code that varies depending on the lgus  he said  however  there were difficulties in applying the ruling to some cities  and the decision making on fund appropriation was left to the discretion of local executives  according to the president   but we are still continuing to look at it  what i  is  what really belongs to local government and what does not belong to local government   he said   also  some  have been given to local governments  sometimes it can t be done because we don t have a new item   we don t have new funds  and we don t have training for whatever  it is for   he said  he said one example was the land use plan  wherein several lgus faced difficulty in implementation because of the lack of money and qualified personnel  adding that this work could be given to the national government   even the repair of school buildings was a contentious issue  marcos said  because it was not clear if the national or the local government should be responsible  the president suggested that the national government could provide additional allocation to the lgus mandated by law to conduct school building repairs  he said the department of education did not have enough budget for school repairs  but that he proposed to vice president and education secretary sara duterte to just give materials  funds  or other forms of assistance to the lgus   ,0

786,when will this house of cards drama end  am pretty sure you are aware of the atty  vic rodriguez saga  it has been going on since end of june  we re mid september  how long will this drag on  in every progression of this saga  it just gets messier  and as it gets messier comes the erosion of the institutional integrity of the office of the president  vacc s statement on the leakage of government documents  not yet made public  is right on the money   the leak of the draft administrative order and the alleged memorandum from the presidential legal counsel should be thoroughly investigated because of the very serious implications involved    the serious implication is clear  a matter that should have been resolved within malacañang by the president seems to have been resolved for the president  that s what it looks like  and it doesn t look good for the office of the president  which is the highest decision making body in our country  atty  rodriguez first got appointed as executive secretary  then issues started to bubble up  allegations of his wrongdoings  improprieties  and inefficiencies are exposed to the public either though direct public accusations of personalities close to the president or through too obvious blind items  but is this drama and political waltzing really necessary  if atty  rodriguez erred  there s the ombudsman  yup  have we forgotten that there s such an institution in our country that can conduct proper investigation on issues concerning public officials  any person can file a complaint against him  the ombudsman can investigate and prosecute acts or omissions appearing to be illegal  unjust  improper or inefficient   illegality  unjustness  impropriety  inefficiency   in some shape or form  these four issues had been raised against atty  rodriguez since the time he was appointed executive secretary  yet why no one is filing a complaint against him    the end justifies the means  is a machiavellian doctrine  some people might have taken it in its vulgar form that any end could justify any means  but those who have really read machiavelli knows this for sure that it is an imperative of skilful statecraft  if the end is morally important enough  if the end would benefit the common good  then pursue it by all means possible  while being cognizant that each mean is an end in itself  the consequence of each means must be weighed as well  thus one must choose the means that would lead to the least adversarial consequence on the road to the terminal goal  perhaps removing atty  rodriguez as executive secretary and demoting him to the position of chief of staff is for the  common good   if this house of cards saga will not end  it s not a farfetched idea that he might just be demoted further as head janitor of malacañang    still inside but not quite there anymore  but the road from point a to point b has produced too many detours and unnecessary consequences to the office of the president that one cannot help but asked  is atty  rodriguez a powerful piece on the political chess board or a domino tile that if removed would lead to other pieces to fall  what the hell is going on  when will the ombudsman be activated to do its job so atty  rodriguez can start answering allegations against him in the proper forum  this political drama has even led to unnecessary ego fist fights among the supporters of the president  what exactly is the point of this chaos  as this continues to drag along  a lot of mere observers to this political drama are confused  tired  and getting increasingly disappointed because a lot of us have signed up for the west wing but we seem to be getting house of cards instead   ,1

798,  leni robredo s supporters need to get real  there is no such thing as a humble politician  politicians tend to be narcissists and are full of themselves   congresswoman and vice presidential candidate leni robredo insists that she doesn t have any ambition to seek the presidency  she said it like harboring such an ambition is a bad thing  she brags about being the only one among the candidates who does not aspire to seek any post higher than the vice presidency  i suppose robredo thinks her statement will make her look  humble  compared to her rivals  she s been playing this  reluctant  candidate act from the very beginning and her tactic is starting to get old  people are starting to think she is exhibiting false modesty  for one  we ve heard it all before  prior to agreeing to be mar roxas s running mate  robredo kept saying on record that she didn t have any ambition to be vice president  now that she is in the thick of the campaign trail for her vp bid  she is saying the same thing about the presidency  somebody ought to tell her to quit saying things she might have to take back later on  it s so easy for anyone to go back to what she said in the past about her stand on issues and call her out on it  she has to be consistent  consistency is not a very common trait among filipino public servants and she s looking more and more like a typical one  someone even made a comment saying that the fresh faced leni is starting to look like a trapo  traditional politician  because of her hypocritical statements  second  she s not making any sense  does she even know why there is a vice president to begin with  the vice president is someone mandated to act in place of the president in the event of the president s death  resignation or incapacity  what if something happens to the president and robredo happens to be the vice president  since she keeps saying she does not want to be president  she won t be able to fill in for the president because she does not want to be in his shoes  the philippines will be in a dilemma because of her  reluctance   as someone asked me on twitter  how can one aspire to be vice president and never consider the possibility of becoming president even accidentally  i can only scratch my head on that one  it seems robredo cannot think too far ahead and lacks foresight  that s not good for someone seeking the second highest government post in the land  she thinks that as the vp  she can continue doing what she wants  like continue pushing her advocacies as if she was still in congress  but if she becomes vp  she will have to answer to the president  at this stage  if popularity surveys are to be believed  mar roxas won t win the presidency so the future philippine president will not be from the liberal party  therefore  robredo won t be free to bring her advocacies to a national level if she ever wins the vp post  this was even confirmed by some of roxas s supporters  because a lot of people who will vote for robredo won t be voting for roxas  the latter s supporters are reduced to begging robredo s supporters to vote for roxas as well and warning them that robredo won t be able to implement her policies if roxas doesn t win  they are effectively saying that it is useless to vote for robredo without roxas as the president  but even if roxas wins  he has his own agenda and it won t necessarily be in line with robredo s agenda  the two running mates may appear united during their campaign sorties but the truth is  they were just forced to run together by bizarre circumstances  it is like a marriage of convenience for them  if they do not have anything in common  their relationship will break down soon enough  the campaign platform they crow about is only good on paper and will not likely be implemented just like what happened to bs aquino s platform in   besides  we ve seen enough philippine presidents and vice presidents whose relationships eventually went pear shaped in the past  the most recent break up is between incumbent president benigno simeon aquino and vice president jejomar binay  binay was even considered a close family friend of the aquinos but that didn t stop members of the liberal party from mounting an attack on binay in an attempt to derail his bid for the presidency  binay then attacked the bs aquino administration  which he is still a part of  in retaliation   another president and vice president pair who went their separate ways were the late cory aquino and salvador laurel respectively  laurel even wrote a scathing letter to cory venting his frustration at their  fundamental differences  and the way cory renege on the promise to be  servants of the people s will and the people s well being   the point is  the same thing can happen to roxas and robredo especially since they don t have a lot in common  i can imagine roxas must be resenting the fact that  from being plucked from obscurity  robredo has now overtaken his popularity with the voters  the liberal party s plan to use robredo to pull roxas s popularity up did not work  they did not consider the fact that the voters can choose the president and vice president separately and not as a team  robredo s supporters are insisting that she is a modest and humble person and their proof is in how she uses public transport in travelling to and from her hometown  but there are people who think this is a shallow reason and are not easily impressed by that especially since she travels in luxury using jets and helicopters to campaign sorties out of town  robredo s supporters need to get real  there is no such thing as a humble politician  politicians tend to be narcissists and are full of themselves  they have to be  otherwise they wouldn t be able to sell themselves effectively  robredo definitely exhibits narcissistic tendencies whenever she promotes her bid for the vp post  she puts her rivals down in order to pull herself up  she doesn t believe in winning based on her merits  she thinks she has to badmouth her rivals in order to win  robredo s supporters also think she is pious  but a truly pious person will not turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed during the present administration  if she does not have the courage to speak out against bs aquino and his cabinet members who are not performing their duties as expected of them  then she is not going to be effective in the vp post  she will not be able to  draw national attention to advocacies that need to be pushed   the bs aquino government has ignored a lot of the things that need attention in the provinces  the farmers suffering from drought is one of them  we have yet to hear robredo criticize the bs aquino government for neglecting the farmers even after the deadly riots in kidapawan  robredo s silence on that matter can be considered tantamount to her condoning the government s criminal negligence there  it boggles the mind when one thinks of why robredo is still sucking up to bs aquino  he didn t even want to confirm her husband jesse as department of interior and local goverment  dilg  secretary when he was alive  he died with the title  acting  dilg secretary  bs aquino made no secret about their fundamental differences in governance and even cited it as a reason for unnecessarily delaying his confirmation    there are various reasons kung bakit acting  in the case of jesse  we had some differences during the campaign as to style  we want to make sure we can really work with each other well  it does no good to get him through the whole process of the ca only at the end of the day to find out that there might be difficulties in our working style  among others  our core philosophy  so we did agree na acting na muna   aquino said   in short  bs aquino did not believe in jesse robredo  it was even reported that he was about to file charges against bs aquino s buddy former dilg undersecretary rico puno for various complaints that reached robredo  puno was also criticized for breaking into his apartment as soon as news broke that jesse s plane was missing  it was rumored that puno wanted to get  sensitive  documents containing information pertaining to an investigation on puno and some philippine national police officials  leni even had to ask the justice department to secure her husband s condominium after the break in   robredo s wife  atty  leni robredo  admitted to the press in naga that she herself had made the request that their apartment be secured  according to a report by abs cbn s anthony taberna on tv patrol thursday  september   leni robredo had asked for heightened security after she was notified that department of the interior and local government  dilg  undersecretary rico puno tried to enter robredo s condominium and offices in the national police commission and the dilg  both in quezon city   it was only after jesse died that the president and the rest of the liberal party members started praising jesse robredo s name  this was after they observed the public s growing sympathy for jesse  the liberal party have certainly made up for their past indiscretions against jesse by elevating his widow s status  i guess all is forgiven now that the liberal party is helping leni become vice president  it turns out she wants the power associated with the post  she thought she d have us all fooled when she said she is not ambitious ,1

843,the chinese embassy in manila said on monday that it had requested philippine authorities to intensify efforts to protect its nationals amid a recent spate of kidnappings involving chinese victims   we immediately checked and verified the specific cases  held discussions with the  communities  and lodged representations with the philippine law enforcement authorities  requesting the philippine side  to protect the legitimate rights and interests of chinese citizens in the country   it said in a statement sent to the inquirer    the embassy noted that in recent years  there had been frequent cases of  kidnapping  blackmailing  illegal detention  and other vicious cases  targeting its nationals due to online gaming and telecommunications fraud  it urged philippine agencies to  strengthen our law enforcement cooperation and their crackdown on kidnapping  blackmailing  illegal detention  and other criminal acts  that endanger its nationals  but at the same time  it also reminded its citizens to  firmly establish legal awareness  keep away from immoral activities  stay away from online gambling and telecommunications fraud  and avoid falling into gambling related blackmailing and injury cases   at the senate  a hearing was set on sept   on the  kidnapping wave  that had reportedly victimized dozens  including chinese and filipinos  and the spread of disturbing videos showing supposed victims being tortured by their captors  some of whom appeared to be foreigners   we want the philippine national police to shed light on the videos circulating and the reports coming from sources so that we will know if these are true or not   sen  ronald dela rosa  senate public order and dangerous drugs committee chair and a former pnp chief  told reporters  conflicting statistics senators grace poe and jv ejercito had pushed for the inquiry in separate resolutions as they also called on the pnp to stop the spate of abductions  both noted that the police had so far presented conflicting statistics about the number of cases  which poe said only caused  undue and unnecessary anxiety and fear  our countrymen   she observed that while pnp chief gen  rodolfo azurin jr  had tried to downplay the string of kidnappings  there were many reports and videos of such incidents on mainstream and social media    this  kidnapping wave is creating a state of fear  anxiety and vulnerability among filipinos   poe said in senate resolution no     there is an urgent need to determine the status of these cases  possible motives  agency efforts to identify the perpetrators and the measures instituted by relevant authorities to prevent the continuous rise of abduction in the country   she added    ejercito said he was particularly disturbed by the proliferation of video clips on various messaging apps and social media platforms showing people  believed to be kidnap victims  being tortured  one showed a blindfolded man whose left ear was severed by one of his captors as two other persons held him down  according to ejercito  another showed several men hitting with a hammer their bloodied victim  all of them  chinese looking   as they engaged in  chinese sounding  conversation   while we still don t know if these videos were real or just a hoax  or if these really happened in the country recently  we need to check  veracity    he said   the government should act swiftly to put an end to this spate of kidnappings and killings  take control of the situation and guarantee our people of their safety and provide an assurance of a peaceful community   ejercito said in senate resolution no    test for gov t he added that it would be better if president ferdinand marcos jr  himself would issue a statement directing the police to solve the kidnappings as he surmised that criminal syndicates may be  testing the waters    every time there s a new administration   criminal groups  test the leadership  they are testing  the marcos  administration and the new pnp leadership   ejercito said  azurin  meanwhile  continued to deny the supposed kidnappings of chinese filipino nationals in metro manila although he said he had deployed more policemen near philippine offshore gaming operators  pogo  establishments in the capital region amid an increasing number of abducted pogo workers   we saw the need to beef up police presence in entertainment areas  specifically in parañaque  pasay and makati   he told reporters on monday  pnp data showed that out of  kidnapping cases from january to september this year   were pogo related  slightly higher from the  recorded in the same period in   azurin said it was a challenge to identify foreign nationals in pogo companies  as well as legitimate operators  because of lack of records    we really need to engage our immigration  so we would know who are the chinese nationals coming to our country   he said  adding that the information would make it easier for the pnp to investigate such cases  azurin also said that members of the federation of filipino chinese chambers of commerce and industry inc  had told him that  the  reported kidnappings are not true    we are really very fortunate because they have volunteered to help us and to report to us any information regarding any crime incident that they know about  as i ve said  there are no crimes that are reported to us that we have not acted on   he said  as for the supposed abduction videos  azurin said these were old incidents that were being released on social media to make it seem they happened recently   i really don t know their intent in releasing those videos because if they think they are hurting the pnp in posting them  they are    the economy   he said  ,0
844,oh  sugar  bbm s balancing act last week we were rocked by the scandal of two opposing decisions  one is the order of the president against importing   metric tons of sugar  and the other  the sugar order no      which allowed it  signed by then undersecretary sebastian on behalf of the president as secretary of the department of agriculture and chairman of the sugar regulatory administration  while the current issue is revolving around the process that led to sebastian deciding to go ahead with the importation  there is a deeper issue here  deeper than the legal problem  even much deeper than the technical problem of whether we should import sugar   in april   the u s  department of agriculture  usda  forecasted that  for    september  to august     sugar production  declining to  million mt  nearly  percent lower than the current usda official estimate for    this is attributed to lower fertilizer usage because of rising fertilizer prices leading to lower yields    further  usda forecasted that the demand for sugar from the  food and beverage manufacturers will look to increase production and sugar usage as the economy recovers from   although rising sugar prices will constrain greater consumption    read  https   fas usda gov data philippines sugar annual    certainly  the obvious solution is to import sugar  however  flooding the market with so much sugar will lead to the price of sugar to decrease  while this will be welcomed by food and beverage manufacturers  as this will bring down the cost of production  this will affect the income of local sugar farmers  the technical question is whether we should import sugar  the answer is yes  but the question also involves a political question of when you should do it  politics isn t just a game of addition  it s also the art of timing  poor timing can lead to a political disaster    is not something that just appeared under the bbm administration  its draft was already presented in the previous administration  understanding  s rocky history is key to unravelling the political peril that president bbm faces  the philippine news agency reported on april    that sugar producers were already against then draft   read  https   www pna gov ph articles    the united sugar producers federation  unifed  was vehemently against  unifed has about   member planters nationwide  unifed president manuel lamata even had this harsh words against the sugar regulatory administrator hermenegildo serafica   the moment administrator serafica signs and makes that draft so  official  we will haul him in court again for contempt and seek his arrest for defying the ongoing case filed against him related to the suspended so     was the standing sugar importation order at that time  the sagay city and himamaylan city regional trial courts issued a tro on   which allowed importation of   mt of sugar  two sugar farmer groups were against   negros occidental federation of farmers associations and the rural sugar planters association inc   was panned by sugar farmers as  grave injustice  untold irreparable injury  loses and damages to the sugar industry that has been devastated by typhoon  odette  on dec     read  https   newsinfo inquirer net      court stops sugar      then senator zubiri was against then draft   he said on april      the proposed   mt importation deal will put them at a gross disadvantage  and leave them completely unable to recover from the setbacks already imposed by the pandemic and the skyrocketing fertilizer prices   senator imee marcos was also against it  calling then draft   an epic disaster   so if  wasn t approved in the previous administration  what gave them  whoever they are  the audacity to approve this now  remember  news about approval of  came out on the same day press secretary trixie cruz angeles stated that president bbm didn t approve the importation order  is the timing coincidental  for me  the approval of  is hitting two birds with one stone  one  to satisfy the interest of sugar importers and the main beneficiaries  food and beverage manufacturers  and two  diminishing the political capital of the president   in april   neda released its assessment of reform directions for the philippine sugar industry  read  https   neda gov ph an assessment of reform directions        one of the key findings of the neda report is that liberalising  which includes importation  the sugar industry would  predictably hurt planters and millers  both of whose profits are projected to decline  percent  while consumers gain in welfare  consumer plus  by up to  percent   neda concluded that  liberalisation would benefit consumers but would favour the rich more than the poor  all this would be at a clear cost to the sugar industry stakeholders   the industrial users of sugar  food and beverage manufacturers  will benefit  but not your everyday families because  sugar   neda noted   takes a much smaller part of the average family budget  and given now widespread dietary health concerns  is even subject to moves to reduce consumption   neda isn t against liberalization of the sugar industry  it only cautions that  it would best be done gradually and only partially  especially in the face of severe distortions in the world sugar market   as i mentioned  the approval of  hits two birds with one stone  satisfy the interests of industry users and importers and to diminish the political capital of the president  the first one is easier to see  the second one needs further unpacking   according to the neda report  there are about   sugarcane farmers from    just as much as    is clearly against their interests  agriculture is a flagship issue of the bbm administration  clearly  this would be targeted by anyone who would like to destabilise his administration by fomenting discontent from sugar farmers and other agricultural workers  why  got approved so easily in the first two months of the bbm administration  while it didn t under the duterte administration  when it was first drafted  the president is not against importation  just like the neda report  bbm wanted to do it gradually and partially  it s about timing it well in order to make sure that sugar farmers don t suffer from the massive influx of the supply of sugar in the market  which is the essence of president bbm s recent pronouncement about sugar importation   a balancing act  watch  https   www facebook com bongbongmarcos videos    now the question is  why was the essential element of timing in politics forgotten when  was approved  am pretty sure that the people in the department of agriculture  and even those close to president bbm are aware of the resistance the draft of  and its precursor  faced during the campaign period and during the last few months of the duterte administration  if they were not  maybe they should improve their political acumen  they know that the president promised to protect the interests of the farmers during the campaign  as early as now  some people would like to make it appear that the president would work against the interests of the sugar farmers  expect more of this kind of handiwork in the next  years   ,1

and i will let justice take its course  remulla s son  juanito jose diaz remulla iii  was arrested on tuesday for alleged possession of over  million worth of kush  or high grade marijuana  the philippine drug enforcement agency  pdea  reported the arrest only two days later without any explanation for the delayed public disclosure that often quickly follows a high profile drug bust  the pdea said the arrest was part of a  controlled delivery  operation in which an illegal drug shipment is monitored under supervision by an antinarcotics officer until the owner or the consignee takes possession of it the justice secretary was then in geneva  switzerland  where he defended the bloody drug war of former president rodrigo duterte before members of the united nations human rights council  after the arrest was disclosed on thursday  calls for remulla s resignation immediately came out on social media from people demanding  delicadeza   or propriety  on the part of the justice secretary  who exercises power and influence over the government prosecutors who will eventually handle his son s case   it s unacceptable to just pen a letter when  as the justice secretary  your son commits what has been painted as the most criminal act in the philippines for the last six  and counting  years  boying remulla should resign   sociologist athena charanne presto said on twitter    mr  marcos said the justice secretary was  aware that he must allow the processes of the judiciary to work properly and that no one in the executive should interfere   the justice secretary also was supported by several lawmakers  including sen  jv ejercito  remulla served as assistant secretary at the office of the president under then president joseph estrada  ejercito s father  and later as chief of staff of sen  loi estrada  the former president s wife   knowing remulla for three decades  i know he will not tolerate this even if it s his son who is involved   ejercito told the inquirer   self evident  according to sen  sherwin gatchalian  the demand for remulla s resignation was  uncalled for  unjust and without basis   public officials  he said  should  be judged on their own merits  on their work performance and not on what other people  even if related to them  do   sen  imee marcos said remulla s statement on the incident was  self evident    i need not say anything more   she said  house dangerous drugs committee chair rep  robert ace barbers said there was no need for congress to investigate the arrest of remulla s son   i pray for secretary remulla and his family  in the same manner that i do offer prayers as well to those other families who are in this predicament   barbers said   the justice secretary s own political party  the national unity party  nup   of which he is the vice chair  commended remulla for  promptly assuring authorities  that he won t intervene for his son  in a statement  the nup said remulla s  professionalism and love of country is unparalleled   opposition rep  edcel lagman also said that as long as remulla was not interfering in the investigation and prosecution of his son  there was no reason for him to step down   double standard   however  the remulla family must explain why it took almost two days for them to reveal or disclose the capture and detention of the remulla scion for the alleged importation of   million worth of kush or hybrid marijuana   lagman said  house deputy minority leader rep  france castro  said there seemed to be a  certain amount of double standard  in the handling of the drug charge against remulla s son compared to the cases filed against ex sen  leila de lima  who has been detained since february  also on drug charges   the double standard becomes more glaring if we compare it with the thousands killed in the bogus drug war of the past administration   castro said  like lagman  she also asked why the arrest of remulla s son was made public only two days later  rumors that the son of a high ranking official first circulated on social media on wednesday  remulla said in his interview with smni that he learned about his son s arrest in the early hours of tuesday in geneva  or around noon in manila   i woke up before dawn on tuesday and i was told something happened in the philippines   he said    i only told one thing to my wife  to get a lawyer since that s the only way to clear things  that s the only thing i said   remulla said   i said  get him a lawyer so he can defend himself  that s a basic right the right to be presumed innocent   lawyer   ,0

880,the first attempt to destabilise the government has arrived  leni supporter percy lapid and a known critic journalist of duterte  bbm  and other government officials  has just been killed  lapid hit a lot of government officials in show lapid fire  but of course this issue would be exploited to the hilt against bbm and duterte  on senator imee s seven point plan on september   as chair of the senate committee on foreign relations  senator imee marcos participated in a roundtable forum held at washington s center for strategic and international studies  csis   the forum was sponsored us philippines society and the stimson center s southeast asia forum  during the forum  she unveiled a seven point plan on ph us relations  she empathically told the americans that  like other southeast asian nations  the philippines has no intention to participate in the  melodrama  of a cold war   don t make us choose between the u s  and china   senator imee then unveiled the  point plan    re examination of the us ph mutual defense treaty  mdt  and the visiting forces agreement  vfa   and progress on implementing the enhanced defense cooperation agreement  edca     pursuit of increased military assistance  more support for local defense contractors    exploration of regional multilateral defense arrangements    expansion of new trade opportunities  including a  green metals initiative   deep sea fishing access  and cooperation under the  chips act    improvements in social protections and public safety nets  she commended usaid and the usphs on disaster relief and recovery     acceleration of professional exchanges  e g   health care workers  teachers and academics    engagement with china  including joint development  confidence building measures  and a code of conduct in the south china sea  the seven point plan is a reasonable basis for the  reset  of us ph relations  after experiencing some bumps during the previous administration  what s worth commenting on elaborately is agenda   re examination of the us ph mutual defense treaty  mdt  and the visiting forces agreement  vfa   and progress on implementing the enhanced defense cooperation agreement  edca   the use of the word  re examination  is an interesting choice  during the  smni senate debates  now nsa chief clarita carlos asked the candidates whether to abrogate or retain the the  mutual defense treaty  mdt  between u s  and the philippines  some said abrogate  some said no  some called for a revision  senator imee clarified during the forum that she s not calling for the mdt s revision  just an  examination  of how it s going to be implemented  i can see two things that needed clarification    issues that often confuse our own citizens  the first one is the territorial scope of the territory  the wps is often considered as philippine  territory  by a lot of our own politicians  however  that s not really the case  a country s territory ends in  nautical miles from our archipelagic baseline  most of the wps is beyond that  and are just exclusive economic zones  eez   the united states has always maintained that the eez is not part of any country s territory  which of course is really what the international law of the seas state  part of the  territory  also includes  island territories under  jurisdiction in the pacific ocean  its armed forces  public vessels or aircraft in the pacific   we often hear u s  representatives that the americans will come to our defence whenever the wps is concerned  what they don t tell us is the territorial limits and the process indicated in the previous two paragraphs  furthermore  obscured from the public is the fact that the united states has a long standing policy not to take sides in the sovereignty disputes in the south china sea  the sovereignty disputes have not yet been resolved  and the territorial conflict still remains    which by and large a remnant of the cold war  the resolution of the sovereignty disputes will have to go back and revisit the  san francisco treaty  which ended the war between japan and allied countries   the second one is the lack of automaticity in our mdt  automaticity means that whenever there s an attack in each other  the other is obliged to automatically defend the other  just like what s in the nato treaty  however  in the mdt  there s no such provision  the action each other could take needs to go through the  constitutional processes  of each other  to defend is to launch a war  and before the united states and the philippines could launch a war to defend each other  their congresses must first approve it   ,1

883,the supreme court  sc  has ruled that  all disputes  claims  and controversies  solely between or among executive agencies  including disputes on tax assessments  must perforce be submitted to administrative settlement by the secretary of justice or the solicitor general  as the case may be   the ruling was issued in the case elevated by the department of energy  doe  before the sc challenging the ruling of the court of tax appeals  cta  in its petition involving the demand of the bureau of internal revenue  bir  for the payment of   billion in deficiency excise taxes  the taxes sought to be paid by the doe to the bir involved transactions on condensates  which the former claimed are classified as liquified natural gas and are thus exempt from excise taxes  on  july   the doe was notified by the bir that the assessment has become final  executory  and demandable  on sept      the commissioner of internal revenue  cir  issued warrants against the doe  when nothing came out of the talks between the two government agencies  the doe filed a petition before the cta  the cta s second division dismissed doe s petition with a ruling that it is not the proper forum to resolve purely intra governmental dispute  when the cta s second division dismissed doe s motion for reconsideration on feb      the bir file a money claim for the assessed deficiency excise tax of   billion with the commission on audit  coa   the doe elevated the issued before the cta as a full court  but its appeal was also dismissed on nov     prompting it to file a motion for reconsideration which was denied on may     doe challenged the cta s full court decision before the sc   the cta correctly steered clear of the case as it lacked jurisdiction over this dispute between the doe and the bir   the sc pointed out in its aug     decision written by associate justice maria filomena d  singh and made public on nov    the sc ruled   wherefore  the petition is denied  the decision  dated  november   and the resolution  dated  may   of the court of tax appeals en bane in cta eb no    cta case no    are affirmed  so ordered   the sc also said   the president  under the constitution  enjoys the power of control over the entire executive department  given that the president  as chief executive  has control over all the agencies in dispute  it is only proper and logical that he first be given a chance to resolve the dispute before resort to the courts   only after the president has decided or settled the dispute can the court s jurisdiction be invoked  neither the judiciary  by prematurely taking cognizance of actions which are otherwise subject to administrative discretion  nor the legislature  by circumscribing such power through legislation  can curtail such exercise of the president s power of control   veritably  the power to tax is legislative in nature  and under our constitutional framework  the power to execute and administer laws  tax laws included  pertains to the executive   pursuant to this design  the legislature  by enacting the nirc  national internal revenue code   has yielded the power to assess and collect taxes to the bir and the cir  under the supervision and control of the secretary of finance   the secretary of finance  in tum  is subject to the control of the president  along with all other executive departments  bureaus  and offices  through which he is expected to faithfully execute all laws   by the power of control  we mean the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter   the following conclusions are  thus  inescapable  the president has the power of control over the bir and the cir  such power of control authorizes the president to alter  modify  or nullify decisions of the bir and the cir  the president can likewise act in the stead of his or her subordinates  and exercise powers directly conferred by law to the bir and the cir   because of such broad power vested in the president over the acts of subordinates in the executive department  it is not only constitutionally infirm  but likewise downright impractical  to allow the judiciary to take cognizance of a matter which can still be undone  modified  or otherwise subjected to the discretion of the executive   it must be clarified that the administrative settlement procedure  as it applies to tax disputes between the bir and other executive agencies  is not meant to supplant or override the power of congress to tax   foremost  it is circumscribed by the very duty of the executive to  faithfully execute all laws   in deciding such conflicts  the executive is bound to observe tax laws   it cannot wantonly disregard them by haphazardly exempting executive agencies or transactions therefrom nor can it proceed with a pre determined result in mind  as feared by the petitioner  doe    rather  the process must result in a determination of the most appropriate arrangement or course of action for the agencies involved  after the executive has taken stock of all applicable laws  rules  and regulations  and how they may be reconciled and adhered to in relation to the dispute   it cannot be utilized as a vehicle for circumventing or disregarding existing laws or justifying illegalities  as these will undoubtedly constitute grave abuse of discretion   by stepping in to resolve disputes between executive agencies before they are ripe for adjudication  the chief executive is not trespassing into the exclusive realm of the legislature  nor is it arrogating judicial power  he or she is merely positively carrying out his or her mandate to execute laws faithfully   the executive s attempt to reconcile disputes  claims  and controversies stemming from implementation of laws must be viewed as deference to the legislature  for it is essentially an effort to breathe life and force to laws they have enacted whilst recognizing the complexities attendant to their implementation   it likewise guards the judiciary from actions where there are no actual controversies between parties  as there is ultimately one real party in interest  fealty to constitutional mandate demands no less   clearly  the cta en banc committed no error in denying the petition  the foregoing discussions leave this court with no other recourse but to deny the petition     ,0

888,  duterte and marcos are seen by many filipinos as leaders who offer a roadmap that could see the philippines return to the stoic disciplined meritocracy it once was   filipinos are coming to terms with the political reality underlying the presidential race today  following the edsa  revolution  in   the pendulum had swung too far out the side of ultra representative  democracy  in the philippines  as a result  the deeply disturbing reality of the true nature of the way filipinos have squandered their  freedom  has all been revealed  rather than apply a mature discipline and sense of accountability in the way they exercise their democratic freedoms and rights  filipinos have  instead  used their freedom to turn their country into a sad global punchline  it is hardly surprising  politicians who are products of the popular vote reflect the character of their constituents  so if  now  filipinos lament the banal thievery of their government officials  the mediocrity in the thinking applied to development goals  and the incompetence of their top leaders and sovereigns  the highways of blame lead nowhere else but back to themselves  indeed  the culmination of the culture of worshipping the notion of  sacrifice  that filipinos have perverted beyond all recognition and  on the back of this  the favour bestowed on politicians who pander singularly to this perverse rule of  sacrifice  is no less than current president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii  son of the late former president corazon  mrs sacrifice  aquino  something s gotta give  and evidently something has today  after three decades of emo governance  sacrifice platforms and mediocrity agendas have been pitched once too many to filipinos and now two politicians representing the antitheses of bakla politics have emerged as serious contenders   rodrigo duterte and bongbong marcos  as compelling challengers to the no results victim mentality pandering campaigns that dominated presidential elections over the last  years  duterte and marcos are seen by many filipinos as leaders who offer a roadmap that could see the philippines return to the stoic disciplined meritocracy it once was  indeed  none of the other candidates offer any semblance of a vision to begin with  administration candidate mar roxas  for one  is seen to be no more than a sad compromise for the once venerable liberal party  the daang matuwud   straight path   doctrine that started out as a campaign catchphrase of bs aquino back in the  campaign has long been tainted by the incumbent administration s bald six year long reign of hypocrisy  under the aquino administration  pork barrel thievery was perpetrated at unprecedented scales and appalling human rights abuses were not only tolerated but sanctioned by malacanang  indeed  bs aquino has been slammed by no less than the united nations for his human rights abuses thanks to the efforts of international lawyer amal alamuddin who earlier this year brought the case of former president gloria macapagal arroyo to the un high commission on human rights working group on arbitrary detention  wgad  which recently ruled that her detention under the aquino regume was  arbitrary  and  therefore  unwarranted   in her e mail   clooney said the un body found arroyo s detention arbitrary and illegal because  the sandiganbayan failed to take into account her individual circumstances  failed to consider measures alternative to pretrial detention  and because of undue delays in proceedings against her   the wgad also found her detention  politically motivated  because her confinement was due to  her exercise of her right to take part in government and the conduct of public affairs  and  because of her political  opinion   clooney said  she reported that the un body underscored the aquino administration s decision to stop arroyo from traveling in november  in defiance of a supreme court ruling allowing her to seek medical treatment for her neck and spine illnesses   but aquino one upped all his predecessors by upping the ante of criminal rule  the possibility of president bs aquino dabbling in high treason may also be emerging  investigators both in the philippines and in other countries may already be in the process of piecing together the puzzle of what exactly was behind the involvement of embattled malaysian prime minister najib razak in aquino s controversial bangsamoro basic law  bbl  project  left to the devices of bs aquino and his shadowy partnership with kuala lumpur  a vast chunk of mindanao would have been carved out and handed over to the terrorist moro islamic liberation front which at one time or another in its history had been funded in various capacities by the malaysian government  and what do detractors of duterte and marcos deliver in the way of intelligent arguments in light of all of the above  predictable ones  they cater mainly to the tired old assumption that filipinos continue to harbour an irrational fear of a return to the bad old days of  authoritarian  rule  in the case of duterte  it is his track record of turning the southern philippine city of davao into a model metropolis with an iron fisted leadership style that is admired by constituents and condemned by the chattering classes of imperial manila up north  as for bongbong marcos s detractors  the epic tantrums they are throwing over his recently announced candidacy centres around just three quaint points     he is the son of former president ferdinand marcos     he and his family should return their  ill gotten wealth  first     he may declare martial law again during his term  but is there anything else beyond these   sound of chirping crickets in the background  specifically  is there anything about the possibility of seeing a marcos vice presidency that one can argue against that has something to do with how he might actually perform his duties during his term  unfortunately  filipinos are known for their inability to think that far ahead and focus on relevant arguments that pass the so what  test  this can be gleaned when one closely examines the nature of their support for the other presidential candidates  the support for these candidates is underpinned by shallow ideas lacking in substance  the thinking is focused on concepts of  honesty   i e  lack of a history of  dishonesty   for one    sacrifice   and none much else  instead of true platforms these politicians exhibit mere lists of issues they promise to  tackle  if elected all of which do nothing but insult the already meagre intelligence of their supporters  in contrast to the rest of the uninspiring presidential candidates  duterte and marcos do offer something different   an alternative to the idiotic dogma of the yellow rhetoric that dominated philippine politics for  years  all it takes is a bit of imagination to think outside the square that has framed the philippine political  debate  over the last several decades  it is time filipinos think beyond their girly fear of  martial law   their infantile aversion to disciplined governance  and their lazy habit of substituting modern logical thinking with a fixation on political superstition ,1
889,  imagine for a moment what it would be like having a president that talks the way leni robredo does   perpetually like a schoolgirl making sumbong to her titas in abs cbn while making tusok tusok the fishballs  i don t think vladimir putin would be impressed   can anyone actually imagine  vice president  leni robredo sitting in front of another head of state discussing serious matters of global consequence  it becomes even harder to imagine after watching her speak in yet another one of her pabebe tirades before her adoring minions in the media  check out this video of her carrying on about the sore boot mark president rodrigo duterte planted on her rear end last weekend   yeah  taglish pa more  leni robredo  one wonders how her chi chi fans from the ateneo can even stand hearing her speak without getting their manglapusian sensibilities offended  robredo may get away with her colegiala accent but  if one is able to look past that  it is evident she simply cannot stitch a full english sentence together  now that shortcoming simply cannot pass the ateneo standard of excellence in the communication arts  folks  then again  are ateneans willing to overlook that and embrace the pedestrian manner of speaking robredo seems to be comfy with  there are bigger questions that this last small question raise  put aside for a moment the electoral fraud allegations that put into question her legitimate claim to the office of the vice president  robredo being  vice president   for now  is just a heartbeat away from the philippine presidency  imagine for a moment what it would be like having a president that talks the way she does   perpetually like a schoolgirl making sumbong to her titas in abs cbn while making tusok tusok the fishballs  i don t think vladimir putin would be impressed  more important than her language skills is the question of whether or not she actually possesses the chops to elevate her discourse  it is difficult to find evidence that she could actually step back from her petty telegenic dramas and talk about the big issues from a plane of thinking a bit higher than the couple of notches above kris aquino speak her level of discourse is currently situated  and still we wonder why the philippines currently suffers from a particularly sticky form of intellectual bankruptcy  right there before us in  vice president  leni robredo is the encapsulation of the root of this acute collective intellectual deficit that crushes any hope that the philippines will be a world class country in the near  to mid term future ,1

896,the government s decision to remove import barriers to electric vehicles  or evs  is a step in the right direction  although policymakers should consider going further by extending similar privileges to hybrid cars   in a press briefing last week  secretary arsenio balisacan of the national economic and development authority  neda  announced that his office had endorsed an executive order to president ferdinand marcos jr  that would suspend for five years tariffs on completely built up units  or cbus  of electric vehicles  plus  import duties on certain ev parts and components will be slashed from  percent to  percent over the same period  the order should become effective by december and will be reviewed after a year  obviously  the government wants to encourage filipinos to buy evs  such as passenger cars  buses  vans  trucks  motorcycles  tricycles  scooters  bicycles and others like them  if that goal is met  the philippines could reduce its dependence on imported oil  which accounts for the largest component of rising inflation these days  the problem is the lack of charging stations in the country  which may discourage consumers from purchasing evs in the coming years  shell philippines only recently opened a charging station south of metro manila  and eight more are reportedly in the pipeline by yearend  clearly  many more charging stations will be needed to encourage robust ev sales  mr  balisacan acknowledged this problem when asked about it by reporters  but he said it was a chicken and egg situation  meaning the government hopes that having more evs on the road will accelerate the development of charging stations across the country  on a related issue  private firms will need to improve the charging technology  based on reports  it takes about  minutes to fully charge an ev at shell  at a cost of  per minute or a total of    the price seems reasonable  but motorists may lack the patience or time to wait half an hour for a full charge  hybrids and ckds regrettably  neda s proposed executive order does not include hybrid vehicles  they are essentially self charging cars that also have an internal combustion engine  a few models have been introduced in the philippines  but if consumers want to buy one  they contend with a long waiting list and higher prices relative to regular vehicles  giving tax breaks to hybrids could have a faster impact on lowering the country s dependence on oil and on inflation  also  hybrid vehicles are not dependent on the development of charging stations  policymakers should consider giving them tax breaks  perhaps until ev sales start taking off  moreover  neda and others in government should consider limiting the tax incentives to completely knocked down  or ckd units  importing ckds will generate jobs  because unlike cbus  they require local assembly before they are put up for sale  for good measure  the authorities should consider incentives for exporting evs and hybrids that were assembled in the country  from the philippines  auto assemblers can sell to other members of asean  or the association of southeast asian nations  that bloc has a combined market of about    and once the philippines ratifies the regional comprehensive economic partnership  rcep  trade agreement among the asia pacific nations  the country will become part of the largest free trade zone in the world  which will include the  asean members  plus china  japan  south korea  australia and new zealand  importing cbus could create a problem   a substitution threat   for local car assemblers that have invested heavily to construct facilities in the country and have hired local workers to operate them  neda is likely aware of this possible issue  which is perhaps why it plans a review after only a year  lastly  the philippines should hasten its development of emission free energy plants  including nuclear power  relying on fossil fuels to run power plants will mitigate the benefits of widespread use of evs and hybrids  surely  no one in the government wants higher electricity prices that may result from higher demand from ev owners  despite all the concerns mentioned here  the executive order proposed by neda should result in a net gain for the philippines  but as we also noted  there is always room for improvement   ,0

910,the government s top spook agency must be shookt    the department of education  deped  is seeking  intelligence funds   million more than the  million sought by the national intelligence coordinating agency  nica  itself  at a hearing on tuesday by the senate finance committee on the proposed budgets for the nica and the national security council  sen  risa hontiveros made the comparison as she added her voice to those questioning the  million additional funding requested by deped  which is now also headed by vice president sara duterte  such funds are normally used for surveillance activities conducted by the military and the police  hontiveros said the department should focus instead on institutional reforms to improve basic education in the country  rather than venture into national security concerns    budget prioritization is misplaced  let s leave intelligence and security to the pros   hontiveros said   we do not question the legal basis for the provision of confidential funds to civilian agencies like deped  but their confidential fund   is higher even than what the state s intelligence agency  asked for   she added  the committee  however  already approved on sept   the   billion budget for deped  including the  million  intel also for ovp the panel on tuesday also approved the intelligence funds for nica and endorsed for plenary discussion the overall budget of   billion sought by that agency for other expenditures  including salaries  duterte earlier defended her department s request for intelligence funds  saying it needed the money for the surveillance of criminals targeting schoolchildren    she had also asked for a separate  million   this time as intelligence funds for the office of the vice president   an item never allotted to that office during the time of her predecessor  leni robredo  senate minority leader aquilino  koko  pimentel iii  during the committee s deliberations on deped s budget on thursday last week  said it would be better to use the  million for the repair of schools damaged by super typhoon karding  international name  noru   hontiveros said that while she would support any program by deped to protect students  it would be best for the department to just coordinate with the police  otherwise  deped would just be duplicating the  existing  national security  national defense  law enforcement  even  women and children  governmental bodies and programs   the senator said   serious education crisis   national security is not the mandate of deped   hontiveros said  adding that the department has  no capability or infrastructure to conduct surveillance activities and crime busts   she cited other areas under deped s mandate where funding is more urgent  such as ensuring the health and safety of teachers and students amid the covid  pandemic  strengthening its education program for the indigenous peoples and improving overall literacy in the country   let us put funds that would benefit the students  we should empower deped to focus on its core mandate of helping teachers and students   hontiveros said   we are facing a serious education crisis  we will lose our focus if we burden an education agency with national security matters   she added  guidelines confidential funds are usually subject to the discretion of the head of the concerned agency  and precisely because they are confidential or discretionary  the commission on audit said these expenditures are  difficult  to examine and would thus need accompanying reports for their proper auditing   in  the commission issued guidelines on the use of those funds which provide  among other things  that they would not be spent on salaries and allowances  procurement of equipment and other such purposes  ,0

916,pre birthday thoughts about fem  if may mga anti marcos man na makabasa nito  huwag po sana kayong magalit  this is a pov  and i am not picking a fight  i am not convincing you to join us  stay where you are  i would actually advise you to maintain being an anti marcos  and continue to be one  why  read until the end  kung bakit gusto kong may mga anti marcos pa rin  sa mga pro marcos  read until the end din  kung bakit kailangan natin ang mga anti marcos for our benefit  shout out ko lang iyong mga nag inspire sa akin na huwag matakot na maging vocal in entering the unconventional public discourse of the  alternative  marcos narrative that has been an oppressed  frowned upon conversation  and a taboo for the past decades  thea tan was intrumental in helping me build this political platform on fb while tiktalk live with joie and koko and tlwjk  are my allies of this niche topic in tiktok  i realized that in a sea of public opinion with potential people to offend  and the  fact checkers  that would potentially intimidate us with their brand of fact checking  they do not or seldom fact check anti marcos misinformation though  and anti marcos memes and anti marcos posts that may lack contexts or misleading are left untouched by them   huwag tayong matakot to be vocal in wishing and praying for the success of bbm  because the success of his government  is also the success of our country  i value my freedom to speak about politics more than ever with my diminished fear that i may offend an anti marcos  especially that our current president never retaliates to his critics  kaya huwag kang ma offend if you do not agree with me  because i am always amused  not offended  to see anti marcos posts because they are part of our success  ok  read more why below  malapit na birthday ni fem  i m genuinely curious what would be the take of our anti marcos friends about this  that marcos will be remembered to be the president who quelled the rise of  communism in our country during a period when communism was very prevalent in the world  especially in our neighboring countries with the effects or after effects of the cold war  para sa ating mga supporters ng marcos in whole or in part  loyalists or pragmatists centrists   we recognize the fact that marcos was instrumental in regulating impeding the rise of communist rebellion through martial law  which is downplayed naman ng mga nasa kabila  there were abuses during the martial law  in fact  lahat ng naging president may abuses  but because marcos was the leader that time  hindi maiiwasang isisi sa kanya lahat iyan  actually  marcos himself recognized the presence of abuses that time  so he issued a presidential decree that addressed the human rights issues  he did not escape this responsibility after all  he manifested his accountability through that pd  exaggeratedly  although we don t deny the presence of victims  mayroon ding mga  pa victim  and these are    the npa themselves using their maoist style of  pa victim  propaganda that is misleading  but looks legit   emotionally manipulative to arouse anger from the people  and leading to get the people s sympathy for the purpose of organizing a mass movement  they call it revolution  to overthrow a democratically elected government  to be subversive  or to establish a shadow government with endgame of power grab and    those who falsely claimed they are victims for the purpose of getting  monetary compensation  from yellow created laws that reward  victims  without clear and stringent guidelines to determine when  why  and how they became victims of ml  kung baga  in my pov  mismong mga anti marcos na ito rin ang gumawa ng relatively vague laws and rules so that it can be circumvented  in my opinion  hence  i am indulging with the idea na maaaring ginagamit nila ito para makakakuha sila ng pera by just pretending they are victims of ml  or iyong mga kamag anak nila  or kakilala  wala rin silang pinagkaiba sa nilalabanan nilang so called  magnanakaw  that was never proven in court with a final and executory criminal conviction of plunder or stealing the nation s coffers  even imelda s   counts of graft  that is being used by the anti marcos for misinformation na may ninakaw sila is not yet final  because the sc has the final decision for this  same process with the previous cases they won  that the media don t want to publicly reveal for public consumption  they even claim imelda s  freedom  na si duterte ang nag pardon daw dahil matanda na raw siya or  pangit daw ang justice system natin  kaya walang nakakulong sa kanila  this is the most outright misinformation peddled by the anti marcos  amplified by our media and big personalities who all have political interests why they are anti marcos  they failed to educate the public that imelda s freedom is the result of the rules of court  same rules that cory recognized at hindi dahil na pardon siya ni duterte dahil matanda na  that s an obvious misinformation  believed  by these anti marcos who themselves claim to be against misinformation  pero sila sila rin ang nabibiktima sa sarili nilang misinformation  many youth and anti marcos would believe that imelda s freedom is politically driven  because our media failed to educate their readers about the legal context of these cases  sadly  many of our journalists are not lawyers  not former law students  or don t have law background to correctly write the marcos wealth cases into its proper context whose practice of journalism is based on sensationalism  advertorials  pr campaigns  and intrigues to fit their private corporate business interests  and not of public interest  hindi naman lahat sa media ganyan  may mga matitino rin  but if you work with a certain corporation  of course  all your news should not be against the business  political  and corporate interest of your company  at the end of the day  hindi natin maiiwasang isipin na pera pera pa rin ang reason why there are laws  rewarding  the alleged ml victims  hindi na naging social justice  kahit sino na lang pwedeng mag file at  magpa victim  for the sake of money  enabled by laws that lack depth and specific clear guidelines  even pcgg themselves are facing corruptions  andres bautista  former comelec chair of pnoy and a former pcgg chief  is facing lots of criminal and administrative charges of corruption due to hidden wealth amounting to more than a billion among others  when he himself is fighting  corruption  through pcgg  another one is former pcgg chair sabio who was convicted with graft  and other pcgg chairs who cannot explain where have the other sequestered assets gone  so maiisip mo nalang  being  anti marcos  is a political ploy  kasi it became effective after ml when cory hired  pr  companies to build her image as the  saintly mother of democracy  amidst the worsening human rights violation during her term and holding the powers of the three braches of the government pending the ratification of the  constitution  yes  cory became a dictator  worse than marcos  at least  marcos  ml was declared in light of communism in the cold war  and it was constitutional  cory s case was a sheer grab of power  and was not constitutional  plain dictatorship  after martial law  people with political interests used the  anti marcos  template  it was effective  the idealistic youth would consider being  anti marcos  as cool or makabayan  amplifying the flame in their youthful soul for the validation needs in their young innocent age  not until the time of duterte  when becoming an anti marcos became a failed political branding  napansin niyo  kahit patay na si marcos  these political figures are still using marcos for their political relevance capitalizing on the nostalgia of edsa   kasi gusto nila ng power  to do that  kailangan nila manalo  at ang branding nila ay anti marcos  neveragain hoping that the edsa  nostalgia will still work  but leaders post edsa failed the filipinos by incurring more human rights abuses  cuddling the cpp npa ndf  more poverty  inflation  more hunger  more crimes  more illegal drugs  and more corruption  these trapolitiko used the  marcos  name not really to seek genuine justice  ngunit para makakuha rin sila sa mga kayamanan arising from the marcos wealth cases na never napatunayan na nakaw in any crimimal proceeding    cases filed   with imelda even winning the historic  trial of the century  leaving the delegation of cory  ridiculed  by the international legal community for using ridiculous  hearsay  evidence  the  pa victim  maoist style propaganda is amplified by the propaganda machinery of the remnants of the cpp npa ndf that has prevalently infiltrated almost every sector in our society but major targets are the media  academic institutions  and numerous  social justice  legal fronts organizations from student groups to religious orders which have big impact to the people  especially to the idealistic youth that are often misled due to their fire  idealism  and genuine desire to be part of change  due to the youth s crucial self validation stage   kaya maraming nag npa na bata hindi dahil sa kahirapan  gutom  o pagmamahal sa bansa  kundi dahil na budol sila sa isang idealismo na may karahasan at pag disown sa pamilya  iyong iba kasi hindi naniniwala na ang martial law was made to quel the communist rebellion  in their pov  ml was used by marcos to extend his power  however  ml was constitutional even the ultra critical martial law museum said that marcos used  constitutional  legal powers  meaning  allowed by the law  to declare the necessity of martial law  for the past  years  the anti marcos political branding made fem relevant up to this day  albeit used negatively  until hindi na siya naging effective  turning the marcos relevance into a positive force with the landslide majority victory of bbm  kapag kasi relevant palagi ang isang tao  pero hindi na effective ang negative campaign  this relevance will rise over these temporary politicking that made the marcos name not just relevant  but a permanent icon to reckon with  don t downplay iyang sinabi ko kung anti marcos  you also downplayed the return of a marcos in malacañan due to your pride at  let me educate you  high horse culture  ang mga anti marcos din ang gumawa ng sarili nilang hukay  para ibaon ang sarili nila sa hukay  sila rin ang dahilan bakit relevant parin ang mga marcoses today  in fact  mas lalong lumakas  despite the presence of rappler  inquirer  philstar  etc na alam nating hindi mabait sa mga marcos  but making leni robredo a star with hourly  positive  news or pr campaign to build a fragrant image probably in aid of the past election or for future election  while demonizing or  hyper critical  against the marcoses  the media template is obvious  because these are the same news media that never or seldom subtly criticized leni  despite her obvious blunders in leadership and incompetence in decision making in terms of national security  and obvious display of incapacity to handle candid interviews and intellectual discussions that her supporters will never acknowledge due to their trust and inclination to follow the narrative of these media that are  friendly  to leni s image packaging her with unrealistic high intelligence through association and political grants and awards from the liberal s institutional allies here and abroad but a subject of ridicule for her critics and ordinary filipinos  these media organizations are not aware that they are helping the marcoses to become more relevant and winnable  unknowingly triggering pinoy s inclination to the  inaapi  narrative the same dramatic plot that they have introduced to pinoy pop culture as a formula to sell their shows or their political brands  ayan tuloy  instead na mainis ang mga tao sa mga marcos  naawa tuloy sila  maraming mga gen z sa socmed  sila na ngayon ang tagapagtanggol ng mga marcos  sabi nga ni imee  she didn t expect it would happen in her lifetime  and yet critics would conveniently deduce or downplay this marcos phenomenon as a result of misinformation  they are really not getting the point  because they are using a  templated  argument they learned from their echo chambers  also peddled by the anti marcos  leni friendly media force  when you engage with them into intellectual and policy based arguments  many of them won t survive  because it s out of their template of anti marcos  one liner argument like marcos magnanakaw  even this template no longer worked  because you overused it  kaya sa tagalog   gasgas  na  wala nang value ang argument  kasi gamit na gamit na  nagiging templated na at katawa tawa sa mata ng mga neutrals  centrists  pragmatists  at loyalists  these are the groups that you humiliated and cancelled  and you will never convince them again if you won t focus on debunking their strkng arguments  naka focus kasi kayo sa one liners  kaya these neutrals think you couldn t debunk their position  eh di mas lalong hindi niyo mako convert and mga loyalista na  years tumindig  in the gen z s generation  ang pagiging pro marcos na ngayon ang  cool   while vocally anti marcos institutions like up  ateneo  and la salle are receiving more backlash and criticisms more than ever  nadadamay tuloy iyong mga neutral at pro marcos sa loob mg mga campus na iyan   this hatred against these campuses is also fuelled by their silence of the cpp npa ndf atrocities and recruitment  a political issue that our gen zs now are very aware of igniting their idealism and need for validation that fighting and being vocal against the terrorists make their youth worthwhile  patriotic  and meaningful for their country  nabaligtad na  iyong anti marcos youth sentiments naming mga millennials was ironically replaced by a more marcos leaning gen zs who are social media savy and more aware of the cpp npa ndf atrocities due to access of information  justifying their support for duterte and pbbm  and probably leading them to the thought that the older marcos was a great president  contrary to what their martial law and post martial law millennial kuya and ate used to believe  ngayon  lumalabas na ang baho nila   some  anti marcos politicians   alam nilang they cannot criminally convict the marcoses with  pagnanakaw  to jail  so they chose to maintain these issues  unclosed  in  years so that they can capitalize with the marcos issues for their political gain  and worse  to commit pagnanakaw themselves  becoming the monster themselves  from the monster image they created that they used to fight   same thing with ninoy s  unclosed  murder case  i think they want to maintain it that way kasi kapag malaman kung sino ang pumatay  hindi na nila mabibintangan si fem  see  bautista had fled the philippines with billion of hidden wealth  and sabio was convicted with graft  these are pcgg chairs  in charge of running after the marcos wealth  they were charged of  magnanakaw  themselves  ironic  right  pero ang mga marcos  never nagtago unlike pcgg chair bautista  and never na convict ng murder unlike the murder convict ninoy aquino aquino  yes  aquino rin ang middle name niya   and never nawalan ng relevance sa philippine society unlike the dying liberal party fondly called dilawan  now pink  so  sa mga anti marcos  continue being toxic  continue downplaying the pro marcks movement  continue offending and insulting the voters  continue disassociating with your pro marcos neutral centrist pragmatist friends  continue demonizing the marcoses and their supporters  without a villain  there s no superhero  sociology basic  if may umaaway sa isang malaking grupo  there s tendency that they become more united to fight a common enemy  my isa pa sana akong sociology theory na sasabihin bakit wrong technique kayo  kaso baka magkaroon kayo ng idea at bigla kayong bumait or baitbaitan  for now  i want this status quo na may anti marcos na maiingay  because it naturally reminds the larger group to be more vigilant and not to trust intruders or threats  remember loren legarda na ka uniteam  pero naka surveillance sa mata ng mga loyalista  ano pay kaya kay leni at mga dilawan na nag negative campaign  eh di mas lalong magagalit ang tao sa inyo  kaya go lang sa pagiging toxic  if you would argue na kaming majority ang toxic  well we have the premium na magpakatoxic kasi kami ang supermajority  we have the numbers and the command  pero kung minority ka na nga at toxic ka pa  you re perceived as threat sa larger group  you re just triggering us to empower ourselves  sa lahat ng anti marcos sa last election  salamat for being instrumental to this phenomenon you downplayed as misinformation  hence insulting the suffrage and political freedom of the supermajority you wish you had  huwag mong i challenge ang ego ng dominant group  it will create its own defense to ensure its integrity

957, in terms of production quality  scale of organisation  and overall pizzaz  the performance delivered by team bbm duterte outclassed all the rest  as many in the audience observed  abs cbn star toni gonzaga was in her element as host of the event    yesterday s campaign kick offs again made the writing on the wall even more evident with the clear topping of the shows of the day by administration candidates bongbong marcos and sara duterte who  rocked  a packed philippine arena  even communist  journalist  inday espina varona was moved to admit    terms of numbers  the son of ferdinand marcos and the daughter of rodrigo duterte won the campaign kickoff mobilisation game  no ifs nor buts   in terms of production quality  scale of organisation  and overall pizzaz  the performance delivered by team bbm duterte outclassed all the rest  as many in the audience observed  abs cbn star toni gonzaga was in her element as host of the event  her booming voice could have filled the arena even without a mike  to that  rapplerette lian buan sourly points out   toni gonzaga  one of abs cbn s biggest celebrities  introduces rodante marcoleta who pushed to deny the franchise renewal of the network costing thousands of kapamilya workers their jobs   buan  still likely butthurt from that  assault on press freedom   seems to suggest that gonzaga owes utang na loob  a debt of gratitude  to abs cbn  that s just typical of kiddie  journalists  glossing over the real facts underlying the demise of the top yellowtard media conglomerate just to push their preferred narrative  of course  a lame attempt to cut down the the host of the show is futile considering not just the star power that was on exhibit in the event but also the chemistry between the candidates  this was evident in the service vice presidential candidate sara duterte did herself in the clear and articulate speech she delivered to introduce herself and the grace she exhibited giving her running mate a rousing introduction  speaking of stars  third generation marcos star sandro marcos seemed to be making his dad proud demonstrating an ability to steal the show from the latter as the crowd roared when the big background screen briefly cut to him as he flashed the victory sign  indeed  it was a wild night   the culmination of steady consistent work over the last eight to twelve months to secure the numbers  form the best relationships and alliances  manage communications and messaging  and  overall  deliver an engaging and sticky brand to filipino voters  of course  this was a journey very well documented by the more objective contributors to the national debate that the opposition s chi chi katipunan educated  thought leaders  like to pretend do not exist  as such  to really appreciate the remarkable nature of what was achieved by the administration camp would be to note what a respected member of the opposition camp has to say himself  albeit a tad grudgingly  about even just the latter two to three months of that journey and what  by now  should be an outcome that no longer surprises   marcos  refusal to slide down and inday sara eventually sliding down to number two coated him with a veneer of toughness and finally lent him the air of being a winner  it also gave both him and her  marcos jr  and inday sara  respectively  something they d lacked thus far  the sense of being backed by a significant  durable coalition featuring former president and speaker arroyo  plus the romualdezes   it was this drama  and the coalescing of the veteran politicians  that boosted marcos  presidential numbers  and made sara the person to beat for the presidency  it sucked all the air out of the room  politically speaking  stalling the moderate momentum of leni robredo who d kept the remnants of the opposition guessing  and absolutely depriving the other candidates  moreno  pacquiao  and lacson  of what their candidacies needed  too  drama  the keep  em guessing plus substitution gambit of  succeeded in its  rerun   the point inquirer columnist and former undersecretary manuel l quezon iii was leading to in making the above observation taken from his piece today  now for the hard part  really had more to do with what he regards as the hard slog the opposition is in for over the remaining weeks of their campaign   this early  his campaign can claim the tantalizing possibility of the first majority presidency since  take your pick  either  or   but there remains hope of the others  currently in the teens or less  percentage wise  to somehow convince the public to join them and thus start giving the marcoses a run for their money   quezon s statement of  hope  for the opposition clearly doubles as a warning  it is a warning because the opposition  specially the  leading  yellowtard bloc within it rallying around presidential candidate leni robredo show no signs of reforming the negative messaging that characterises their campaign and which contributed to the running to the ground of their campaign  even more important for the opposition is that they reconsider the sorts of characters they habitually associate themselves with  in the case of the yellowtards  chummy chummy relations with the philippines  catholic church the officers of which are held to a vow of obedience to their overlords in rome  displays like these   of nuns in ancient habits performing ancient rituals   raise questions around how serious robredo s camp are about upholding their supposedly progressive character  the standout example  in this instance  is their supposed championing of women s issues and their supposed alignment with the  causes  of feminism and gay rights  the roman catholic church  we might remind everyone  stands for everything that feminists and the gay community are against  the big challenge in the coming weeks is mainly on the opposition nuisance candidates  will they continue competing amongst themselves for the number two position  or will they be able to pull together the mettle  the creative chops  and the groundbreaking originality required to gun for number one  abangan ang susunod na kabanata ,1

967,  if leni robredo and her lot cannot even change their campaign style what makes them think they would know the first thing about mounting an effort to implement long overdue change in the philippines   leni robredo today issued a statement asserting that she regards herself as a  healing leader   exactly what this means is anyone s guess but what seems to escape the blinkered minds of her supporters is how it was really her yellowtard lot who drove through the wedge that today deeply divides philippine society  the divisiveness the yellowtard  cause  is manifested in their habitual use of colours to define their exclusive community of  woke  partisans  a political colour is meant to invoke exclusive tribalism rather than come across as a call to be inclusive  one feels this when seeing the pompous and self righteous manner with which members of robredo s mob signal their party affiliations by bathing their campaign events and social media paraphernalia in pink today  indeed  the use of this new pink branding seems to actually have the unintended effect of highlighting even more their lame attempt to distance themselves from their yellowtard roots  it is worth noting too that former president noynoy aquino himself spent the bigger part of his term identifying himself with the yellowtard brand  he showed his being a yellowtard first and a filipino a distant second whenever he made public appearances sporting a yellow ribbon pinned to his shirt or suit  this made it easy for then rising candidate rodrigo duterte to demonstrate his loyalty to all filipinos first   by using the national colours to define his campaign  evidently not having learnt enough from that loss in  and then again in  when the entire yellowtard  otso diretso  coalition endorsed by no less than robredo herself was wiped out at the polls  the opposition have latched on to this very same campaign style  the same coloured stunts and spectacles  the same self righteous campaign style  and the same negative rhetoric is on exhibit  it seems the yellowtards are really not serious about winning the  elections  how could they be when they ve chosen a loser politician like leni robredo to lead them  what is it exactly that leni robredo plans to achieve if given the chance to lead the country from   if robredo and her lot cannot even change their campaign style what makes them think they would know the first thing about mounting an effort to implement long overdue change in the philippines  robredo cannot even seem to make a basic promise to make the philippines a better place if given the chance to serve as its president  a  healing leader  she now tells us  what results does that drivel even imply  what does success even look like following a robredo presidency  the mystery persists ,1

issues he believes filipinos care deeply about  especially the economic recovery program  the government s pandemic response  the return of face to face schooling  and the food security crisis  according to executive secretary victor rodriguez     it s all about our economy  the economic plans  with the face to face opening of this coming school year  it s all about covid response  and when we speak of covid response  it s not only about health  it goes all the way to the entire cycle   he told reporters on friday    not just health  you go into economy  you go into education  and so on and so forth   rodriguez said  the president had planned to burn the midnight oil over the weekend to fine tune his speech to be delivered before congress at the batasang pambansa in quezon city  he was intending to work on the draft  until morning of monday to finalize his sona message   the malacañang official said  rodriguez claimed that marcos had been personally writing his own lines   it s a work in progress   he only said when asked for details such as how many pages or how long the speech would be  the official said digitization or the adoption of digital technology by the government to improve efficiency and promote innovation would also figure prominently in the sona   in terms of governance  he  wants to see a  digitalized  governance and  digitalized  administration   rodriguez said  food sovereignty another subject the president plans to spend some time discussing is food security and sovereignty  he said   that s why he took head on the portfolio of the department of agriculture because he is aware of the impending food price crisis and probably food supply crisis   rodriguez said   but for now  we are really confronted with the food price crisis  for the supply  except for the supply chain  i hope we will   under his leadership   be able to institute measures to mitigate its impact on us   he said    marcos also wants to highlight the need to achieve food sovereignty   meaning we don t have to rely on much importation anymore   said rodriguez  adding   if we can feed ourselves as a nation  and if we can feed ourselves as filipinos  i think we are on our way to where we want to be  much like where our neighbors are   rodriguez did not identify any specific bills the president would ask the senate and the house of representatives to prioritize  but biñan city rep  marlyn alonte on sunday said she hoped marcos would push for legislation on local vaccine production amid an upswing in covid  cases  she said she would be joining the move in the house for the establishment of a center for disease control and of a virology microbiology institute  as well as proposed measures on the medical  nursing  and medical technology professions  according to alonte   local production of vaccines can create new jobs for graduates of health professions and engineering courses  we have the ecozones and industrial estates here in biñan and in different parts of the country where vaccine production can be done   she noted that the department of trade and industry announced last year that the board of investments was in talks with seven local firms for the production of vaccines and plans to set up a full scale vaccine manufacturing facility  after his speech  according to rodriguez  marcos will busy himself with the proposed  budget  which must be submitted to congress within  days after the opening of its session in accordance with the constitution  maximum tolerance some   law enforcers have been deployed for

avenue  pro marcos demonstrations  on the other hand  shall be permitted along ibp road in batasan hills  much closer to the batasang pambansa complex   we have already completed some recalibration of our security measures as a result of the decision to allow some groups to hold their activities in some portions of commonwealth avenue   de leon said  the tight security measures prompted the commission on human rights  chr  on sunday to remind the police to  exercise maximum tolerance during peaceful protests  as the country listens to mr  marcos  first sona  in a statement  chr spokesperson jacqueline de guia said the authorities must protect the public s right to peaceful protest in the same manner that it seeks to maintain order  as such  the commission  strongly advised  the police not to use water cannons or firearms during expected protest actions  and to disperse mobilizations in compliance with human rights standards   the use of force must be avoided and restricted to the minimum extent necessary when handling nonviolent protests   de guia said  adding that the chr would dispatch its own investigators and lawyers to monitor sona rallies for any abuses

urged the government to  put an end to ejks and  steps to replace an exclusively punitive approach to drug control with an approach fully in line with the international covenant on civil and political rights   its recommendations were part of a long list of human rights issues and recommendations made just before the country submits itself to the upr process    red tagging last month  justice secretary jesus crispin remulla met with the un in switzerland to reaffirm president marcos  commitment to the drug war  he also pushed back against criticisms that  red tagging  accusing someone of

investigate all human rights violations against rights defenders  activists and journalists  for bayan secretary general renato reyes  the language used by the committee showed that remulla s claims  did not sit well with     not convinced   the committee clearly recognized that red tagging was a threat to human rights defenders and must therefore be stopped  it is not protected speech  contrary to the claims of the justice secretary   he said  the committee further recommended that all victims of human rights violations should have access to compensation schemes similar to the human rights victims reparation and recognition act which sought to indemnify martial law victims  it also asked the government to review and amend the anti terrorism act of  and refrain from using counterterrorism and criminal legislation to curtail freedom of expression and assembly  at the same time  it sought the release of former sen  leila de lima  who is still detained on what her supporters say are fabricated charges of drug trafficking  according to reyes  the list of recommendations showed that the experts  do not appear swayed by the claim that the justice system in the country is working for the victims of human rights violations    they are not convinced that the human rights situation has greatly improved   ,0

996,  the opposition uses religion whenever convenient  they have a special dispensation from the catholic hierarchy in the country  specifically from soc villegas and broderick pabillo  this is actually very disrespectful     i really find it revolting how the opposition can use the name of the lord god in vain for the sake of politics  in his philstar piece  getting what we deserve   today  columnist boo chanco suggests that  maybe god is using duterte not only to punish us  but also to make us realize there is a better alternative if we only repent and change our ways   he then calls to the heavens beseeching the almighty to save the  good  but utterly desperate yellowtard camp   there are those of us who think that if we get a servant leader who is god fearing and with the competence to run our government to replace duterte  our problems are solved  if that s all we need  let us make sure  is elected next may because she is all that  competent and a servant leader with the common good as her only motive to be in public office  we can pray for god to intervene and let vp leni lead now   what happened to all the religiosity which was one of the hallmarks of the cory aquino administration  did that put a stop to corruption  did her appointees think twice about entering into deals with cronies of former president ferdinand marcos and other scams which defrauded taxpayers  did the emphasis on religion have any effect on the oligarchs who replaced the marcos cronies  not by any minuscule measure  the opposition has really run out of ideas because they re running plays from their old playbook  this is why marcos is at center stage again in comparison with president rodrigo duterte  it s guilt by association  you can t help the feeling of deja vu when you see the success of build  build  build and the biggest increase in spending for social services post marcos and  yet  the opposition is still bent on demonizing the president  chanco asserts that leni robredo is the leader we need  not for anything but isn t robredo committing a sin by engaging in a relationship with a married man  they can try to bury this all they want but it s an open secret as far as the public is concerned  this doesn t make robredo any different from our other politicos who are lotharios in real life  at least  they aren t hypocrites like she is  in   rappler came out with a story that it thought would be enough to damage duterte s reputation   a piece about the accusations leveled by his wife when she filed for a declaration of nullity of marriage  it became a non issue with duterte coming clean with his relationship with honeylet avanceña and their daughter  kitty  end of story  the public accepted that reality of duterte s personal life  in fact  they identified with it because some of them are in the same boat due to the absence of a divorce law  robredo  on the other hand  is being packaged as a saint by people like chanco when she doesn t even come close to being one  the opposition uses religion whenever convenient  they have a special dispensation from the catholic hierarchy in the country  specifically from soc villegas and broderick pabillo  this is actually very disrespectful of the filipino whom the opposition regard as stupid enough to fall for this kind of propaganda up to now  we fell for that when cory was up against marcos   a time when the church was still very influential  the  good  versus  evil  narrative is worn thin to the point that it s so sheer that pinoys can see through it now  the truth is the duterte administration has achieved more in five years than the thirty years the yellowidiots were in power  it is not about form  it is about substance and impact on the lives of ordinary filipinos  god has a way of rendering justice to the oppressed and to those who use his name in vain  but you have to give it to the opposition to be so evil to the point of being unconscionable  this is their true character  diabolical  ,1

999,  indeed  no less than a philippine senator   bam aquino   continued to latch on to a baseless  presumably divinely inspired  list of  fake news  sites to substantiate his assertions     despite the length of the senate inquiry on  fake news  and the amount of noise it generated  there was very little real insight that came out other than the realisation that information is  out of control  in the philippines and  as a result   the truth is dead  in its society  yet  whilst a lot of navel gazing on the culpability of information producers and regulators went on  there was very little said about the accountability of consumers of all this  out of control  information  nobody in the body of  experts  that convened this  fake news  inquiry acknowledged that there is something seriously wrong about the collective intellectual faculties of philippine society that predisposes filipinos to act and react willy nilly on false information  indeed  no less than a philippine senator   bam aquino   continued to latch on to a baseless  presumably divinely inspired  list of  fake news  sites to substantiate his assertions   never mind that nobody could ascertain how exactly the catholic bishops  conference of the philippines  cbcp  decided which sites should be in that list  as far as aquino was concerned  it is true because the cbcp said so  aquino s way of thinking mirrors the very ignoramous society that has become a hotbed of flawed  sloppy  and lazy thinking   one that could not even clearly define its own affliction and  instead  arbitrarily slaps a popular buzzword   fake news   to the cancer killing it from within  for lack of a clear understanding of its own illness  filipinos  and their  representatives  in their legislature  have simply decided they are  sick  of  fake news   not surprisingly  given this sloppy and lazy framing of the problem coming all the way from the top  thought leaders  of the land and the now widely accepted use of a quaint buzzword to encapsulate it  the wrong solutions have gained traction  one such reported solution is the creation of an  information police  proposed by former solicitor general florin hilbay  the premise of his solution is that the hapless filipino is  confused by an environment where officials of the executive department  in particular  are able to disseminate false information while demonizing the press  and activist citizens   hilbay envisions his information police as    a public institution whose sole task is to identify and publicize government dishonesty   this is quite amusing considering that it is tantamount to a tacit admission that filipinos are simply too stupid and too lazy to step up to their duty of participating in the democratic processes available to them such as actively engaging with their executives and representatives  voting wisely during elections  and intelligently participating in public discourse among others  a democracy is presumably one where a people is ruled by a government created by the people  when one conveniently forgets that important feature  one becomes the kind of bozo hilbay is  a bozo who comes up with the following laughable functions of a proposed  information police   to create standards for verifying information provided by government  to actually verify information provided by government  to publicize its findings  and to issue rewards to citizens who are able to spot fake information provided by public officials  the above functions describe a  police  function that operates under the presumption that government is crooked  when you apply the democratic principle that democratic governments are mandated by the people one can then go on to conclude that a crooked government is one that rules a crooked people  that we have come to this point where bozos like hilbay could actually come up with the notion of an  information police  and keep a straight face after the punchline  makes us quite sure that the philippines has truly become a truly effed up society  back in  jaime licauco pointed out in an inquirer article that   a nation whose policies and rules are based on the assumption that everybody is a cheat and liar unless proven otherwise cannot long endure   when we start seeing a spectacular powow such as what transpired on live national tv yesterday  the  october   where  presumably  the top legislative minds and media leaders  after hours of  debate   utterly failed to get to the crux of the matter of the  fake news  cancer afflicting their constituents and where a philippine senator pompously waved a document produced by a medieval coven of men in robes given blanket immunity from scrutiny by a society of  god fearing  people  it is perhaps high time that we reflect on the prescient assertion licauco issued back in  ,1

1005,the head of the senate finance committee on friday said more than  billion had been set aside for next year to settle the unpaid pandemic benefits of health workers  but nearly half of the amount has yet to be funded  sen  juan edgardo angara said lawmakers allocated almost  billion to the department of health  doh  in the proposed   trillion national budget for   which the senate approved on wednesday  to provide benefits for health care professionals in the battle against covid    he said an additional  billion would be sourced from the  billion  unprogrammed appropriations   or public funds whose use has not yet been specified in detail  leaving   billion still  unfunded    we still lack funds for it   angara told the inquirer  republic act no    or the public health emergency benefits and allowances for health care workers act  was passed in april this year  payments of pandemic benefits called health emergency allowance  hea  are to start on july   but these were made retroactive to july   resulting in arrears for the government as no allocation was made for that in last year s budget  angara said  billion had been allocated for the pandemic benefits of health workers in   billion from unprogrammed funds and  billion from the doh  he said   health workers were entitled to receive this benefit  the law provided similar benefits to  outsourced personnel and other personnel  hired by the government to help contain the pandemic  he said  doh officer in charge maria rosario vergeire on friday said no hea funding source for the second half of this year had been identified  she said that the department of budget and management  dbm  told the doh that  additional revenues of the government  could be tapped  the doh had requested another  billion from the dbm for the hea for the remainder of the year  vergeire said last week  members of the alliance of health workers  ahw  on thursday staged  a day of protest  against their  unjust  compensation and the unpaid pandemic benefits  they demanded a minimum monthly  living wage  of   for all health workers   angara said the salary demand may be granted  only if the government can pay and sustain it long term    otherwise  it is like a false promise or false hope   he said  sen  jv ejercito  who authored the universal health care law  supported the wage demand  because of inflationary considerations   he was backed by senate minority leader aquilino pimentel iii  according to sen  risa hontiveros  the doh made a commitment during the senate budget deliberations that it would implement the mandated salary grade  granting   in monthly basic pay for nurses in state owned health facilities  she said she also asked the doh to review its remaining  unobligated funds  for  and use that money to pay for the overdue benefit claims   our health care workers should rightfully be compensated while ensuring that wage gaps between and among public and private health care workers and in national and local settings are addressed   hontiveros told the inquirer  reconciling  versions the senators and members of the house of representatives comprising the congressional bicameral committee on the proposed budget on friday began work to reconcile the two versions of the national spending bill   although there are disagreeing provisions and about p  billion worth of increases in

s version of the national budget  the senate also realigned  million in confidential and intelligence funds  cif   the house s version passed in september included   billion in  institutional amendments  that mostly went to funding health  education  transportation and other services   angara said hontiveros hoped that the senate amendment to realign millions of pesos in cif would be retained  compromise in the case of the  million confidential funds proposed for the department of education  deped  headed by vice president sara duterte  angara initially wanted to move  million to the maintenance and other operating expenses  mooes  of the office of the vice president  ovp   hontiveros proposed spending that amount for deped s own mooe  particularly the healthy learners

projects that lack funding  cristina palabay  karapatan secretary general  said that in particular  the cif for the ovp and deped should be used instead for public health  education  housing  food and cash aid  and other social services   many believe that sara duterte s huge cif will likely be used to surveil teachers and students  and bankroll the massive troll army that drives the marcos

1034,the government should study whether talk of amending or discarding the  constitution undermine efforts to draw foreign investments to the philippines  many people  including prospective investors  have criticized the country for changing or even reversing policies  often every six years when a new government starts its term  policymakers might want to look at countries with more economic restrictions than the philippines  like china and vietnam  and how they manage to lure more foreign direct investments than most markets in the region  arguably  china and vietnam are fraught with challenges that are more difficult than what investors encounter in the philippines  because of their communist systems  for instance  china and vietnam do not allow private ownership of property  there are also restrictions on the repatriation of income  and for many foreigners  there is a daunting language barrier  at least for china  there are also concerns about the security of intellectual property  still  investors flock to those countries  of course  there are many reasons why  not least of which is their large and increasingly affluent consumer base  but more to the point  investors going there can be fairly certain that the rules of doing business are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future  that certainty may be attributed to the stability of their respective governments  in china  the communist party has been in power since   for its part  vietnam has been ruled by the same party since the north and south were consolidated by the communists in   of course  both countries later opened up their economies and essentially embraced capitalist reforms  without losing the identity of their political systems  a similar stability may be seen in singapore and perhaps until recently  malaysia  like china and vietnam  one party has dominated politics in each of these two southeast asian nations  but unlike the earlier examples  singapore and malaysia are actually investor friendly  that stability factor deserves more study  as it could explain why foreign investors have been flocking to china  singapore  malaysia and more recently  vietnam  the philippines should be doing comparatively better than them in attracting foreign investments  here  there is no communication barrier to those who speak english  the language of international business  filipino culture is familiar to westerners and others from countries where investments typically originate  of course  there are hurdles in the philippines  but note that the investment barriers existing here are also in vietnam and china  at least in its earlier stages of development  certainly  those two countries cannot match the ease of doing business in singapore and malaysia  so  a common factor among them seems to be the continuity of laws and other policies  not unusual as mentioned earlier about the philippines  a typical complaint is the constant shifting in rules and policies that create an unstable and hard to predict business environment  this is what some people mean when they claim that there is no sanctity of contracts in the philippines  on a positive note  people are more hopeful about the new marcos government because it pledged to continue many of the policies of the previous duterte administration  as expected  though  the senate has started public hearings on amending the constitution  perhaps even changing the entire system of government  and recently  there was a suggestion being floated to scrap the  constitution and bring back the  constitution  whether or not these proposed changes are beneficial  is not the point of this editorial  rather  talk of change is like background noise to efforts to lure more investments into the philippines  president ferdinand marcos jr  just wrapped up a visit to the united states where he talked to major american conglomerates and business groups about opportunities here  earlier  he visited indonesia and singapore where he secured investment and trade pledges worth billions  one might wonder whether prospective investors might be thinking about how their businesses might be affected by the proposed changes  and whether future governments will continue to honor the commitments made today  economic managers and policymakers need to ponder on that possibility  addressing it could unlock the full potential of the philippines   ,0

1054,  in leni robredo s efforts to bring down the the duterte government  she is inadvertently bringing down the entire country  the consequences of her actions would be devastating to filipinos who have suffered instability for decades     is current philippine vice president leni robredo one of the dumbest politicians in the philippines today  with her recent actions  it seems like it  robredo has decided to go on a full head on collision course against her president rodrigo duterte   someone she is supposed to serve as part of her mandate  in a pre recorded video meant for the  annual meeting of the united nations commission on narcotic drugs in vienna  austria  robredo addressed her  concerns  about duterte s war on drugs   we are now looking at some very grim statistics  since july last year  more than   people have been killed in summary executions   and    some of those who have told us that when there s crime  they normally go to the police  now  they don t know where to turn  our people feel both hopeless and helpless a state of mind that we must all take seriously   she said   the problem with robredo is she reported unverified claims against duterte and the philippine national police to the international community  specifically the united nations  without backing them up with data from the law enforcement agency  for someone who is advocating against  fake news   robredo made serious allegations based on hearsay  she s being inconsistent and a hypocrite as usual  it s like she s not a lawyer  she has pissed off the philippine national police by painting them in a bad light  she didn t even ask them for clarification about their scheme  palit ulo   which is  a commitment of a drug suspect to provide assistance in the arrest of a  bigger fish  in the illegal drug syndicate   robredo s action is despicable  it is tantamount to treason  in her efforts to bring down the the duterte government  she is inadvertently bringing down the entire country  the consequences of her actions would be devastating to filipinos who have suffered instability for decades as a result of destabilisation efforts by the liberal party and their allies  robredo doesn t care about respecting philippine institutions and upholding the rule of law despite calling for it in her statements to the un  if she did  she wouldn t ask for international intervention in dealing with local issues  and robredo advocating for rule of law is quite laughable considering she allegedly benefited from electoral fraud  she seems desperate lately because there is a strong probability that the presidential electoral tribunal could decide on her fate soon   a decision that might not be favourable to her once it is proven that she benefited from electoral fraud  robredo s actions could be her way of getting back at duterte for firing her from her cabinet post  she may want to avenge her loss of face by destroying duterte in the eyes of the international community  it doesn t seem to matter to her if the rest of the philippine population gets dragged down too  her latest antics prove that she is not very smart  she doesn t know how to play politics discretely  she is blatant in undermining her rival  her style quite often backfires though  she must be the most hated politician in the philippines today  second only to senator leila de lima  just because robredo is not part of the duterte government anymore and is not included in cabinet meetings doesn t mean she has to direct her questions to the outside world  while robredo comes across as an airhead  filipinos should not underestimate the people feeding her head with material to say to the international media  a lot of members of the international media still think she has credibility  unfortunately  this has a lot to do with their own bias against duterte  they will believe whoever says what they want to hear and if robredo says the things they want to hear  she will be their  credible source   these meddlers need to be put in their place and told to butt out of affairs they do not understand  robredo overestimates her ability to lead   million filipinos  she can t even offer alternative solutions to the problems the philippines is facing today  how is she going to face off with drug lords with her tweetums style  her charm would only be good for selling coffins   something only people need when they are dead  she ll probably bring back  daang matuwid   she keeps emphasizing that duterte should focus on poverty alleviation instead of fighting criminality  she s too stupid to understand that reducing crime is good for investors who can provide employment and alleviate poverty  a vp trying to undermine her president doesn t look good at all  it just makes her look like she wants to replace duterte  self serving  robredo is acting like a traitor  it s as simple as that  she should step down as soon as possible  the problem is she neither has the brain nor conscience to do so  she is so power hungry  she doesn t care if the philippines  reputation gets tainted even further as long as she achieves her goal of being president  she s digging her own grave  now that is dumb ,1

1057,  this exercise in releasing  fact checking  hounds into the social media  debate  of the philippines is just another instance of yellowtard thinking faculties undermining the opposition cause    no matter what they do  the opposition led by the liberal party cannot wash the yellow stain off their yellowtard brand  despite many rallies organised and many  reminders  to  wear white  in those rallies  the opposition will  in the eyes of the majority of filipinos  remain as yellow as day old piss  branding  after all  is an important aspect in the persuasion industries  re branding is a costly marketing endeavour that requires focus and consistency   both of which the philippine opposition have consistently demonstrated an utter lack of  and yet the opposition continue to soldier on  using a loose definition of the term  soldier   like those  wielding child soldiers spraying ineffectual automatic fire willy nilly at crack army rangers in the movie black hawk down  this is too bad for maria ressa s rappler and ellen tordesillas s vera files  both are identified with the opposition and  as such  are both tainted with this unfortunate colour of the aquino cojuangco feudal clan  worse  their latest coup  bagging a  partnership  with social media behemoth facebook to  fact check  information filipinos consume on its platform  has become an utter fiasco  just several days old  the ill thought out initiative already draws scorn from a mounting number of filipinos and sticks another fat pin  this time on the philippines spot  in the world map printed on the ass of its ceo mark zuckerberg already bristling with many such markers  the lack of sense in setting up yellowtards as arbiters of  truth  on a social media platform is akin to hiring a filipino to referee one of manny pacquiao s boxing matches  ressa and tordesillas  quite simply  cannot be trusted to make judgement calls on what gets visibility   and what gets buried   on users  newsfeeds  already  facebook is under pressure to explain how their mysterious  algorithm  decides what users see and don t see on their newsfeeds  this latest  fact checking  initiative in the philippines puts two faces to that  algorithm   already a major gaffe on the part of rappler has all but confirmed the folly in adding more redundant intervention into social media timeline engineering  a recent  fact check  directed at an old report published by filipino satire site adobo chronicles became the latest source of netizens  laughs  adobo chronicles describes itself as  your best source of up to date unbelievable news   this seems to have escaped the sensibilities of rapplerette paige occeñola who pompously declares   claim  rappler ceo maria ressa has been elected as the president of the foreign correspondents association of the philippines  focap    rating  false  facts  rappler is not a foreign media outlet and is not a member of focap  maria ressa has not been elected as president of the organization   occeñola may as well be bragging about lecturing a circus troupe about the impossibility of fitting thirty clowns in a volkswagen beetle  in a statement released by about this  fact check  fail  adobo chronicles observes   rappler s fact check is very self serving  it used it to defend itself against accusations that it is partly foreign owned  we call it damage control  but more ironic is the fact that rappler chose to fact check a satirical piece  it seems that maria ressa and her colleagues at rappler need to go back to school so they can learn about satire   more importanly   if rappler can t even distinguish real news from satire  then what credential does it have to justify its  appointment  as a fact checker  as one of the followers of adobo chronicles said   how can rappler defend its own gullibility   as i suggested in a previous article  perhaps rappler should focus more on its internal capability to produce good quality journalism before it presumes to  fact check  the world  in so doing  it can learn to compete more and whine less  only when rappler learns the ealier and ditches the latter  can filipinos truly and respectfully welcome it to the jungle that is the darwinian landscape of today s social media  again  and it cannot be emphasised enough  the philippine opposition needs to find a way to ditch the yellowtards and scrub all trace of the yellow stain off its political brand  this exercise in releasing  fact checking  hounds into the social media  debate  of the philippines is just another instance of yellowtard thinking faculties undermining the opposition cause  filipinos deserve an intelligent opposition which  needless to say  is a key foundation of an intelligent democracy ,1

1104,     the shape shifter style with which leni robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the  elections to the present has got pr written all over it   if there is something current  vice president  leni robredo has so far proven  it is that she is a good performer  her most recent pr stunt in which she delivered her  recommendations  on ways to improve the  fight  versus the coronavirus came across as a pretty competent stage act that left her fans gushing  unfortunately  all it really proved is that robredo can read but not necessarily lead  after all  she went into what seemed to be the finer details around  restarting the economy    budget utilisation   and  reporting of data    fields of expertise that clearly go way beyond her known expertise in the fields of  human rights  lawyering  indeed  considering that she delves into fields that vex even the most competent of administrators in these times of covid  pandemic  it seems pretty premature or too much of a jumping of the gun to be praising evidently scripted words coming from a  vice president  who could barely string together a sentence in straight english  in mounting these quaint stunts  robredo plays into an easy   even exploitative   space  filipinos are renowned for their inability to tell the difference between the fictious character played by an actor on tv and in the movies and the actual real life character of said actor  this is the reason many actors make it big in philippine politics  look no further than the likes of senators lito lapid and bong revilla  among others  not to mention joseph  erap  estrada who actually bagged the presidency in  and fernando  ang panday  poe jr who came disturbingly close to achieving the same in   as such  the manner with which even the top opposition  thought leaders  latch on to someone like robredo who has no proven track record in executive leadership nor  at the very least  administration comes across as a bit daft  reading off a script certainly does not prove much  for that matter  the shape shifter style with which robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the  elections to the present has got pr written all over it  when one does not have a stable political platform upon which to deliver one s messaging to one s constituents and  instead  relies on prompts from pr consultants  one tends to simply bob up and down on a sea of public opinion and  as such  come across as pathetically inconsistent  there is a place for pr driven public messaging and that is during election campaigns  robredo has obviously not matured beyond the same campaign mode her rabidly partisan followers seem to expect her to sustain  this is not appropriate given that she has been warming the  vice president  seat for the past four years now and is part of the government she presumably contributes her ideas to  if her supporters see the media stunt like manner with which robredo trumpets her  recommendations  as a successful indictment of the philippine government s efforts to do its job  she is on the hook to correct that perception if one assumes that she delivers these recommendations not to make her government look bad but to genuinely contribute to its success  the question to robredo therefore is  what is the real intent of her delivering her recommendations to the media first rather than to her own government in the first instance  the answer to that question is what will ultimately be the real test of whether leni robredo is fit to lead the filipino people  evidently being able to read alone just doesn t cut it ,1

1108,  leni robredo was  of course  a party to this vicious vilification campaign  she ran under the lp banner  took to the campaign trail with roxas and aquino  wore the lp s yellow colours  and sang from the same daang matuwid hymn book   at the centre of all the chatter surrounding the ascent of leni robredo to the office of the vice president of the philippines lies the question  what will be her role in the administration of president rodrigo duterte  the future does not look too bright for the presumptive  vice president   putting aside the allegations of electoral fraud and the non compliance of the liberal party to commission on election  comelec  rules around the submission of the party statement of contributions and expenditure  soce  that cloud the office of the vice president  there is little robredo has to offer that would be of interest to duterte  robredo  by her own doing  has pretty much locked herself outside of the soon to be president s circle of trust  during the campaign  robredo had all but shot herself on the foot by by issuing evidently ill thought out statements that run counter to duterte s envisioned approach to straightening out the philippines  duterte  if we recall  rose to power on the back of a promise to apply more  shall we say  iron fisted means to crack down hard on rampant criminality in the country  to that  robredo has reportedly vowed to  lead the fight against   on that front  she goes further to assert    for me  it s going to be a huge challenge    she admitted in an interview at the tomb of her late husband  former interior secretary jesse robredo  where she paid her respects before voting   as a general rule  i think the vice president should be supportive of the president in spite of party differences  it s your obligation to the people to work together  but there are some things that can t be compromised   is one of those   robredo said   to be fair  where exactly  human rights  begin and where that hard crack down ends is a point of contention in duterte s vision  police  after all  require justification to shoot and kill criminals under philipine law  however  it is also difficult to justify allowing an official who had categorically expressed an intent to lead a fight  against  you into your team  specially on an initiative that had been the cornerstone of your campaign  indeed  robredo even cited her hometown in naga city  bicol where  she reportedly pointed out  local government there  were able to achieve the same results without resorting to those things   to which duterte responded by assuring her that his government would not interfere with naga city s affairs  according to duterte    i do not also subscribe the style of her leadership  tabla lang kami   she does not like me  i do not like her  so no problem   duterte told reporters in davao city   robredo is also  lest we forget  a member of the liberal party  lp   the out going ruling party presided over by out going president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii  she ran under the lp banner in partnership with its presidential candidate mar roxas  the lp had  over the course of the campaign  sustained a vicious attack on the persons of all candidates running against its fielded bets  in the heat of the campaign  aquino himself called for a united front against duterte  aquino also referred to duterte as  a future threat to democracy   roxas  for his part  mounted an agressive campaign to follow through on that messaging and  in the final stretch to election day  attempted to forge a last ditch  unity  alliance with another rival candidate  senator grace poe  presumably to combine their respective voters  base in the hope of beating duterte who was  by then leading the polls  roxas reportedly described that call for unity as  a call for decency   as if implying that duterte s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency  roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him   in his statement made during a hastily called meeting with the press at his campaign headquarters  roxas said that what is more important now is the future of the country than the political careers of any candidate   uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship are looming over our country once again   he said   i call for unity  i call for decency  i call for democracy  i call for the rule of law    so desperate was this project to win the election that president bs aquino himself issued a statement in support of it framing the effort as  a demonstration of country before self   essentially saying that duterte s presidency would be the death of philippines  indeed  aquino even insisted that the prospect of a duterte presidency  carried similar dangers to nazi leader adolf hitler   leni robredo was  of course  a party to this vicious vilification campaign  she ran under the lp banner  took to the campaign trail with roxas and aquino  wore the lp s yellow colours  and sang from the same daang matuwid hymn book  perhaps someone should ask robredo what her position is today on that vilification campaign mounted by her party against duterte  it would be wise for robredo s handlers to caution her against even thinking of backpedalling from those statements of her party mates or distancing herself from the lp itself  doing so would be a clear sign that all of what she said under the lp banner and while wearing those yellow shirts during the campaign were all lies ,1
1109,i was asked about what i can say about the us allocating about   million us dollars in the implementation of edca  my answer is this  edca was negotiated during the pnoy administration as a way to  deter  what that administration viewed as chinese  aggression  and  expansion   pnoy even likened that to nazi germany  a seductive but faulty analogy   military strength is directly related to economic development  but there are exceptions  such as north korea who acquired the ultimate deterrent   nukes  at the expense of its economic developments in order to ensure its survival  on the surface  it s irrational because why would you develop nukes rather than your economy first  north korea faces what we call an  ontological security  situation  ontological security is about survival of one s way of life  it s more primal than  traditional security   when an actor faces an ontological security situation  actors often choose paths that look irrational but on deeper analysis it is rational when we take a deeper stock of what counts as  benefit  and  cost  in the strategic calculation of the actor facing an ontological security situation    million usd   peanuts  to illustrate how laughable that amount is  the estimated earning of pacquiao in the mayweather pacquiao fight was around  million usd  magkaroon na lang tayo ng boxing as a way to raise funds for our military    hahahahah  mas malaki pa makukuha natin at di pa tayo nakaasa sa amerika  us foreign direct investments  stocks  in china in  is about   billion usd  taiwan has the same claim in the south china sea as china because they are just one and the same  us foreign direct investments  stocks  in china in  is   billion usd  you don t need to be a math genius to see that the   million usd dollars us would be giving to  develop  our military is nothing compared to how the us invests in the economies of our territorial rivals   furthermore  us has no military presence in taiwan  in fact  in   the  mutual defense treaty between the republic of china was terminated  replaced by the taiwan relations act which committed the us supply defense services and materiel to taiwan   in this story  there is a mendicant having the illusion that the loose change it receives can ever equal the investments the ceos enjoy in the running of their companies  clue  it s not the country which the us hates   ,1

1117,jan writer  political writer and instructor of political science and international relations  shared his brilliant read why leni robredo s presidential bid isn t catching fire because of one big flaw in their campaign strategy  basically  jan writer said leni s campaign strategy is quite obvious  remember the doctors for leni  nurses for leni  lawyers for leni and so on and so forth expressing support one after the other for robredo  the robredo camp enlist these groups in the hope that their support and influence will be translated into public support  according to jan writer  their plan is anchored on a weak premise solely because of lack of understanding of their own the filipino culture  in addition  jan writer blamed the so called catholic ideals and their emphasis on materialism  that is why there is always a clash between the rich and the poor in catholic countries  that explains why communism is common in many catholic nations  you may continue reading jan writer s original fb post below  leni s campaign strategy is quite predictable  enlist the support of the upper crust  doctors  lawyers  actors  business people   intellectuals   and so on  in the hopes that their support and influence will be translated into public support  the plan s weakness  as is typical of them  is their lack of comprehension of their own national culture  as a result of so called catholic ideals and their emphasis on materialism  there is always a friction between the elite and the poor in catholic countries  this is why communism is so prevalent in many catholic nations  in these countries  the elite class is often seen as oppressors rather than friends  as a result  when these elites force their political beliefs and attitudes on the general public  animosity and resentment only rise  for many filipinos as sentimental as we are as a nation their political convictions are all they have  they will not allow it to be taken away from them  most certainly not by the elites  ,1

1131,  marcos s memory lives on today because the opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of filipinos   president rodrigo duterte s niece nuelle duterte has  for several years now  been used as an opposition poster girl by the philippines  big corporate media organisations because she reportedly tells people she meets in new york  where she works as a  psychiatrist   that her famous uncle  kills people   in a recent facebook post  nuelle explores the idea that filipinos are victims of  operant conditioning  which she describes as  a process of changing behavior by rewarding or punishing a subject each time an action is performed until the subject associates the action with pleasure or distress   she then goes on to assert   the  is being conditioned to accept that corruption is normal  extrajudicial killing is justified  and criticism is akin to rebellion  there s something terribly wrong when people are so easily conditioned  that some even choose it over freedom of thought   i m of the impression that nuelle grew up in davao before she migrated to the us  i m not privy to her age but i would assume she was still a child in the late  to early  when davao city was akin to no man s land after sunset  it is easy to say that filipinos are being  conditioned  by duterte  but this duterte hasn t experienced how davao city was at its worst  she also wasn t a resident of the national capital region  ncr  during the aquino administration  extra judicial killings  ejks  did not stop after the ascent of cory to the presidency  this was the policy because fidel ramos was armed forces of the philippines  afp  chief at the time and  subsequently  defense secretary  it is no secret that ramos followed the dictates of the us when it came to counter insurgency  he was also the head of the philippine constabulary  pc  and the integrated national police  inp  thereafter under the administration of ferdinand marcos  the civilian home defense forces  chdfs  became civilian armed forces geographical units  cafgus  under his watch   paramilitary personnel in every barangay as part of the counter insurgency strategy  the other duterte must also be aware of narco states of which mexico is the leading example  cartel violence has seen civilians in the crossfire  in colombia  at the height of pablo escobar s power  he held an entire country hostage through his vast wealth through murders of government officials and bombings that killed civilians  he even planted a bomb on an airliner  that nuelle duterte has become an opposition icon because of her surname is typical  what makes it offensive is she isn t even a filipino citizen  she is not nuanced in what s happening in the country in the same manner that other fil ams are  look at ruben carranza  a former pcgg commissioner  who turns out to have held us citizenship at the time he was appointed to a government position  as   postulates  our problem as a country is not only political but also socio cultural  we have  journalist activists  against the administration but in the payroll of the oligarchs  they are a power bloc unto themselves  they would like to think  this is why they have lost credibility  they are mercenaries  the goal of every impoverished pinoy is to cross over to the other side of the social divide from have not to have  we have this photo of manny  pac man  pacquiao eating with his hands while  on the side of his plate  one could spy gold plated or even real gold cutlery  his initials  mp  stands for mamamayan at panginoon we are told  he believes or his handlers are making him believe  that this is his pathway to the presidency  our politicians pander to the poor in every election cycle because they comprise the most number of voters  the poor are agog at the attention paid them for this short span of time  they are used to the routine of their votes being bought during campaign seasons  any well meaning politician will start off as an idealist but will eventually be consumed by the system  this is why i am amazed at the effrontery of leftist militant bohemians such as the cabal of inday espina varona  she praises erik matti s latest cinematic masterpiece on the job  the missing  but doesn t see herself in the role that john arcilla plays as the mouthpiece of political kingpin manong pedring eusebio played by dante rivero  we have seen journalists being the grantees of edifying scholarships such as the uk s chevening and canada s mcluhan but they re none the better once they are back home to continue in the practice of being paid hacks  this practice shows no signs of abatement as even the millennials are following in the footsteps of their seniors  just look at the rapplerettes of maria ressa  they are the future of philippine journalism  scary  right  while the aquinos ninoy  cory  and noynoy are resting in peace  marcos continues to be the bogeyman for the opposition  marcos s flogging is worse than what mussolini or qaddafi ever got  marcos s memory lives on today because the opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of filipinos  they are no better than the frailes who wanted filipinos to remain ignorant so they can be manipulated at will  this is what abs cbn achieved  in the service of the filipino people worldwide   i have gone from an idealist in my youth to a pragmatist as a yuppie as we were then called  the fact is there is no single politician in the country who can claim to be as clean as what the opposition claims the members of their ranks are  this has been the case since time immemorial  the yellowidiots have never made good on the promises they made while in the process of ousting marcos in  and they can t claim the success for it either because credit to that belongs to juan ponce enrile  gringo honasan and the us  i m no duterte apologist but i can see what he has been able to achieve in his five years in office despite his having to contend with the shrill opposition  that is a separate achievement in itself  think of what he could ve been done if the opposition cooperated with him for the sake of nation building  what we have actually seen is the conditioning being done by the opposition on the filipino people since   the infrastructure marcos built bears mute testimony to his achievements  this is also true in the case of the  defeated  vice presidential candidate ferdinand marcos jr   who continues to rank higher than the  winning  vice presidential candidate leni robredo in surveys for the  election  contrast this with the opposition whose members  after thirty years in power  can only boast of naming whatever in honor of ninoy aquino and the monuments to him throughout the country   an unofficial  hero  whose fifteen minutes of fame was had at the tarmac of the airport now named after him  pathetic ,1

and  on friday  their local transmission    the world health organization  who  also confirmed on friday the presence of xbb in the philippines and seven other western pacific countries  as it urged these nations to continue observing health protocols  speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an annual conference by the philippine chamber of commerce and industry  mr  marcos said he would not name a health secretary for now because  e have to get away from the emergency  the emergency stance of the doh  because we have to open up businesses  we have to make the philippines more hospitable to travelers  both business and tourists    or now  i say  we are looking for ways so that we can normalize it and we don t have to say that the philippines is still in a state of calamity   the president said  proclamations the country remains in  a state of calamity due to the coronavirus   as declared in  by mr  marcos  predecessor rodrigo duterte in proclamation no    duterte extended that edict the following year with proclamation no    mr  marcos said it was not yet time to lift the state of calamity   we cannot remove ourselves yet from the way that we are handling it  because  for example  if i lift the state of calamity  our health workers will not get their benefits that are in the law  we will not be able to import the vaccine  the procurement will be too slow   he said  but regardless of pn  being still in effect  the country should treat covid  as  no longer   an emergency but something that we will have to manage forever   the president said   it s like flu  like pneumonia  it s always there but let s be careful not to get sick  and that is the way that we should be handling covid   he added  asked about another matter  appointing an agriculture secretary  mr  marcos said of the post he concurrently occupies   there are things that the president can do that a secretary cannot  especially because the problems are so difficult that it would take a president to change and turn it around      local cases  in a forum on covid  on friday  the doh noted that while xbb and xbc have been detected in  regions  these transmissions were more  localized    this means that we cannot link them to either someone with travel history outside of the philippines or with exposure to someone who recently traveled outside the country   dr  althea de guzman said  referring to the transmissions as  local cases   the doh defines local transmission as cases that are not  epidemiologically linked   since they are limited to a certain area  whereas community transmission refers to huge clusters of infections whose source cannot be traced  de guzman  epidemiology bureau director of the doh  nevertheless emphasized that  our actions have always been  the assumption that there s community transmission     what we ve been doing when other variants of concern  detected   she said  the doh on tuesday confirmed  cases of xbb in western visayas and davao regions  and  cases of xbc also in western visayas and davao  as well as in the cordillera administrative region  cagayan valley  calabarzon  metro manila  mimaropa  central visayas  soccsksargen  caraga and the bangsamoro autonomous region in muslim mindanao  soccsksargen recorded the most number of xbc cases at  percent  followed by davao at   percent  infections in the other regions ranged between  percent and  percent  based on the covid  vaccination dashboard of the doh as of wednesday  soccsksargen had a first booster coverage of only   percent  while davao also had a relatively low turnout of   percent  an estimated   million have been fully vaccinated so far  with   million of that figure having availed themselves of first boosters  in its update  the who confirmed that  besides the philippines and singapore  xbb had been detected in the western pacific countries of south korea  japan  cambodia  brunei  australia and new zealand  new variants  expected  otherwise majority of these countries  including the philippines  have declining trends in infections  hospitalizations and deaths  the who said as it cited increased vaccination coverage as well as  strengthen surveillance and health care capacities  but dr  babatunde olowokure  health security and emergencies director of who western pacific  said it was important that these countries  remain vigilant     this  is expected  we expect to see variants occurring over time and  continue to do so as long as the virus is present   he said at an online news conference    continued emergence of subvariants and recombinants poses a risk of resurgence and  overwhelming health systems in the region   olowokure said  ,0

1174,i don t know if former vice president leni robredo is just being competitive but a day after president bongbong marcos was officially inaugurated as the country s  president  she just launched her angat buhay ngo  many duterte and marcos supporters can t help but question the motives of leni robredo s ngo and think she is doing this to stay politically relevant until the next election and run again for president  staunch duterte supporter and manila bulletin writer krizette laureta chu perfectly captured the sentiment of the duterte and marcos supporters in her latest facebook post  chu said the only way leni robredo s ngo will change her perception that it is for her political plans in the future is when she and her followers will work quietly in the background  sans the fanfare and stop making it appear they are better than the government like what she did to the duterte government  chu cited unicef and tzu chi as prime examples of ngos who help the people without fanfare just like what they did in yolanda ravaged communities in the visayas  until then  she will not stop thinking leni robredo s ngo is not really to help but to keep her in the news and in the minds of the public until the next election  you may now read ms  chu s original fb post below  paano daw ba malalaman na totoong ngo yung kay leni robredo dahil mabuti ang puso nya  at gusto nya tumulong  and not to keep her politically relevant in the next few years so she can be made to run again  ganito  when she helps and does not compete with the government  when she helps and her followers won t say   nauna pa kami kay marcos   the way she did with duterte  when her followers help without making it appear that they re better people than marcos supporters  when they help quietly and without fanfare  there are many ngos in the philippines and many helped during the duterte admin but not one made it appear that they were competing with duterte  only leni robredo and her followers and supporters would help and then make everything a competition  when unicef comes  they help without fanfare  they also have donors they need to be accountable to  but they can make a report internally  tell me honestly  is there any one ngo  as in non government organization  that blasts the government if it were first on the ground instead of government  or that competes with the government  tzu chi almost single handedly and consistently saved leyte post yolanda and not one peep from them about the massive f ckup of aquino administration  so if leni robredo and her followers can be quiet and dignified in their mission to help in the next few years  then i will admit that i am wrong in thinking that this ngo is nothing but a ploy to make her politically relevant  that this isn t a way to continually undermine the current government as they did the duterte government  that this isn t a way to show off what leni can do to prepare her in  against sara  i want to know that an ngo  a group that exists because it isn t and shouldn t be connected to government  will not be used as a tool in a long game being played by liberal party acolytes to rebuild their decimated party  marunong naman ako tumanggap na mali ako but i am confident na hindi  makikita natin yan sa next  years  sana nga kahit one time wala akong marinig na yabang o kwenta  sana mali ako  sana tama kayo  ,1

1191,ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  is looking forward to having a  strong partnership  with france on nuclear energy as the philippines moves closer to adopting this power source to improve its long term energy security  marcos held a bilateral meeting with french counterpart emmanuel macron on the sidelines of the asia pacific economic cooperation  apec  summit in bangkok  thailand  where they discussed energy  agriculture and defense  the president said he engaged macron to talk about energy because france is a leading proponent of nuclear energy and its experience is quite extensive  which the philippines could rely on if it goes ahead with a partnership   i m very confident that it will be a strong partnership simply because they have up to  percent of their power production from nuclear energy  so they are very  very used to it   marcos said after his meeting with macron  marcos previously expressed his desire to adopt nuclear energy as part of the country s power mix and the need to build new plants  in his state of the nation address in july  the president said that should the country opt to use nuclear energy under his term  the government will use the guidelines adopted by the international atomic energy agency  iaea    i believe that it is time also to reexamine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the philippines  we will comply  of course  with the international atomic energy agency regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after fukushima   marcos told lawmakers  he admitted that while innovations would allow power plants to utilize nuclear energy on a smaller scale  funding could be an issue   in the area of nuclear power  there have been new technologies developed that  smaller scale  modular  nuclear plants and other derivations thereof  once again  ppps  public private partnerships  will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited   he added  marcos  father  former president ferdinand e  marcos sr   was one of the proponents of nuclear energy  the bataan nuclear power plant  the country s first and only nuclear power plant  was unused for fear of accidents  agri  defense cooperation meanwhile  marcos said he also brought up agriculture to see how the philippines can get assistance from other countries or entities   i had a very extensive and quite productive meeting with president macron of france and of course  we discussed some of the regional issues that are impacting upon the economy and the worries that we have for the future and the partnerships that are developing between even far off places  what we used to regard as far off places like france and the philippines   he said  defense was also discussed  the president said  pointing to interconnectivity not only in the global economy but even political structures around the world where france would be involving itself in   so there is increased involvement in exercises  there is increased presence in the asia pacific region and all of that   marcos said   so  these are areas that     the three basic areas where partnerships could be explored  he was also kind enough to invite me to visit france when the time comes   he added last month  french ambassador to the philippines michèle boccoz said that marcos is likely to visit france  but cited no definite date as to when it will happen  on september   the two leaders for the first time talked to each other by phone  where they agreed to deepen their countries  relations in terms of low carbon energy  food security  defense and human exchanges  marcos and macron also met on september  at the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york   ,0

1199,  any truly genuine opposition needs to provide filipinos innovative options and strategic alternatives  the fake oppositions filipinos have been subject to  and remain subject to even today  push their agenda through fear and emotional blackmail   according to senator bam aquino he will be joining a  coalition slate  which will be made up of people willing to speak out and stand up against malacanang s policies that may be damaging to the people   in a post on his website  aquino called for a need for a  genuine opposition     in   hindi lang  the force  kailangan  we need  the resistance    a genuine opposition slate  kailangan ng mga taong magsasama sama  magtutulong tulong para labanan ang polisiya ng administrasyon na nakakasakit sa tao  you will find me on that slate   said sen  bam   you need a slate that s independent from pdp laban  that s willing to oppose  willing to stand up even if it s unpopular  and even when it s dangerous  kailangan natin ng oposisyon para sa ating demokrasya   the senator added   one wonders then  was there ever an  opposition  against the administration of current philippine president rodrigo duterte  according to aquino  there hasn t been one   at least not one that was  willing to oppose   the fact that he is calling his new little project a  genuine  opposition suggests that he is creating the real deal and that any previous  oppositions  were all mere fake oppositions  perhaps someone should ask aquino  so what were all those rallies  movements  and calls for  international criminal court  investigations against duterte in the last  months all about  who are the communists and the yellowtards  were all these political posturings  mass actions  and the symbolic gestures made by communists and yellowtards not expressions of genuine opposition to the incumbent  in short  what exactly does bam aquino mean by the term  genuine opposition   perhaps i can answer that question for him  the garden variety  opposition  that has long characterised practically all  opposition  movements and parties  and  yes  even  coalitions   in philippine politics have all done no more than serve as platforms for personalities to challenge people in power and pitch themselves as mere replacements  the art and science of political  opposition  in the philippines has never involved anything bigger or more meaningful than individual personalities and individual agendas  there has never been any long term vision for the filipino people nor any clear defining construct around what the philippines stands for  as a consequence of these persistent intellectual deficits in philippine politics  there has never been any form of roadmap to the future laid out before filipinos  therefore  the goal of a truly genuine opposition is to provide that vision and a definition of  the filipino  that could frame truly national aspirations towards which a yet to be drawn up roadmap to the future could guide a nation  the first step is to fill or  at least  narrow the intellectual deficit towards achieving the foundation mindset upon which a truly genuine opposition movement could be built  aquino should recognise that the philippines he plans to take on this journey is home to a society that is fixated on the past and is hobbled by much cultural baggage  indeed  much of these are evident in the very rhetoric of the current presumably non genuine  opposition   today s  opposition  cannot move on from using ominous  reminders  of past  tyrannies  which it uses to make filipinos scared of embracing new ideas and experimenting with new approaches  it is also an opposition that is backed by the philippines  roman catholic church   an institution that has  in many instances over the last  years  hindered deep reform in philippine society by imprisoning filipinos within medieval mindsets by encouraging belief at the expense of modern facts based thinking  aquino  therefore  has an immense challenge in this first step alone   changing the way filipinos think  the way filipinos currently think is what sets the agenda of the national discourse  much of what underpins the rhetoric consists of obsolete problems that beg obsolete solutions  one such obsolete problem is the  martial law  bogeyman which is used ad infinitum as fodder for that old  return to authoritarianism  scare tactic that hopelessly paralyses philippine political discourse  everything that an incumbent administration does   the way it manages military action  implements emergency measures  proposes changes in governance  and manages public relations   is criticised by traditional  opposition  elements through the lens of a tired reminder to be  vigilant  against imagined but  nonetheless   chilling  trends that could  lead to a return to authoritarianism   an athlete that had recovered from an injury cannot get back on top of his game if he or she remains paralysed by the fear of getting injured again  this is the reason  perhaps  why filipinos cannot seem to unite around forward focused agendas and  instead  unite in fragments around romanticised historical relics and  heroes   different factions and personality cults in philippine politics have different interpretations of the past  but the future is different   because there is better hope in uniting filipinos around a common future vision  therein lies the key to uniting filipinos on common ground  the focus of the political rhetoric needs to be shifted from the past to the future  in this way  every political activity can answer the question what s next  proponents of current forms of most political movements and activism in the philippines are left scratching their heads when asked this simple question   no to a return to authoritarianism   ok  so what s next   no to us  dictarorship   ok  so what s next   no to jeepney phaseout   ok  so what s next  any truly genuine opposition needs to provide filipinos innovative options and strategic alternatives  the fake oppositions filipinos have been subject to  and remain subject to even today  push their agenda through fear and emotional blackmail  it s high time a truly genuine opposition lead the way for filipinos looking for real alternatives  truly genuine oppositions should not merely oppose for the sake of opposing or for the sake of a person s  or specific clan s or clique s  agenda but build upon the good outcomes of both incumbent and previous administrations as well  it remains to be seen if senator bam aquino really knows what he is talking about when bandying around the term  genuine opposition   to that  one can only suggest for now  abangan ang susunod na kabanata ,1

1246,  martial law was brought about by ninoy aquino because he meant to topple marcos through the communist party of the philippines and its terrorist arm the new people s army  cpp npa  and the moro national liberation front  mnlf   why  he was obsessed with becoming president     this is an excellent proposal by one of the few objective academicians of the university of the philippines  retired political science professor clarita carlos  on a facebook post  she articulates her idea of convening a team of scholars to mount a  scientific  evaluation of the  years that ferdinand marcos ruled the philippines   quite troubling that many among us choose only certain segments of the  years of marcos  administration but make conclusions for all of the other aspects of his administration    note that marcos ruled the country for  years assisted by thousands of us who continue to live to this day    i  for one  had been a consultant of pm virata and had been one of the first trainors of the career foreign service development program at dap  in the early     if we want a scientific assessment of  years of his administration  then  let us compose a team of scholars who will agree on ff  a  methodology for assessment b  relative potencies of variables like agriculture  education  health  foreign policy  etc c  data sources d  data analyses   the results of    shall be made public and a series of rtds to be conducted to give way for any and all challenges to the assessment report  trivia  if some bright minds will again label me as pro marcos because of my views above  you have two options    read my phd dissertation on fm and   find a deep lake where you can drown yourself  i hope that this initiative flies seeing that even that chi chi educational institution in katipunan that has become a den of yellowtardism  the ateneo  has so far dismally failed to exhibit the same scholarship when it comes to their favourite bogeyman  indeed  marcos is not all good but he was not all bad either  proof  look at cory aquino s administration  unfortunately there aren t many other academics who can be objective in their assessment  why  it would debunk the narrative which has been spun for marcos by his detractors  as winston churchill said  study history  study history  in history lie all the secrets of statecraft   the declaration of martial law wasn t meant to extend marcos s term  he already addressed that by amending the constitution to adopt a parliamentary form of government  with or without martial law  that would ve been the outcome of the  constitutional convention  martial law was brought about by ninoy aquino because he meant to topple marcos through the communist party of the philippines and its terrorist arm the new people s army  cpp npa  and the moro national liberation front  mnlf   why  he was obsessed with becoming president and he wouldn t have the opportunity for as long as marcos was in office  ninoy probably thought it was his birthright considering his provenance  marcos had no provenance to speak of  he only had his brilliant mind  it is for this reason that he was cleared of the murder of julio nalundasan even if he was actually complicit  jose p  laurel thought it would be a waste of such a man if he was jailed for a crime borne out of political rivalry  the yellows and the reds have been having their cake and eating it too  why should individuals who have taken up arms against government be regarded as  heroes  as they have been glorified in the bantayog ng mga bayani in quezon city  why is marcos being blamed for the lost youth of the  and   why can t we move forward from marcos and martial law  the simplest answer is it s a convenient excuse for the failures of the yellows and the reds so history will not judge them as failures  it has become evident that they are fuming over the election of rodrigo duterte to the presidency in   this is the will of the people which they refuse to respect as they did with joseph  erap  estrada in   they employed the same with gloria macapagal arroyo  gma  after she had a falling out with them  the yellows and the reds are going all out in their vilification of duterte and marcos because they realize that it makes perfect sense for both to run and will likely win as a tandem in   this will be the end of them ,1
1247,about a dozen harvard students flocked to a scheduled lecture by former philippine vice president leni robredo  one of the hauser leaders currently in residence at the famed university  it was all because of a promised free meal  but alas  the students were deeply disappointed when the free meal was served in the middle of robredo s lecture on democracy and disinformation  it consisted of soup  salad and sandwich  some of the students interviewed by the adobo chronicles said they had expected to be served with lugaw  rice porridge  that the former vp was famous for back in the philippines  one of the students said   i ve never had lugaw all my life so i was looking forward to having it for the first time  only to be served with the usual  boring  american fast food meal    ,1
1248,  this is the intellectual cancer that the philippine opposition under the leadership of the liberal party  a k a  the yellowtards  continues to infest the nation s politics with  rather than encourage intellectual debate  the yellowtards continue to stunt and poison filipinos  minds     calling for a laban or  fight  is easy  you can see how easy it is by observing any schoolyard brawl   bakla ka raw sabi ni totoy  payag ka    kalabitin mo sa titi    siga ka ba  di ka naman papalag   filipinos then grow up  leave the schoolyard  then go on to apply the same childish mentality to their supposedly  grown up  politics  recently  philippine presumptive  vice president  leni robredo issued the equivalent  grown up  version of a schoolyard call to action by raising the long dead laban slogan of her long dead political party in her latest ululation   as your duly elected vice president  i took an oath to defend the constitution  you can count on me to do everything in my power to right this wrong   robredo said at the free the courts forum at the university of the philippines  up  as she hit the quo warranto petition  as the  final blow to the ideal of justice   robredo uses an old fashioned  though  to be fair  still effective  technique of mass persuasion used by demagogues of yore     jump off from a claim to administrative authority   as your duly elected vice president      style yourself as being on a mission from god   i took an oath to defend the constitution      describe said mission in nebulous terms   you can count on me to do everything in my power to right this wrong      put forth a  victim  that is  under attack  and therefore needs to be  rescued    final blow to the ideal of justice   the fornmula is structurally the very same sort of call to action issued by popes and imams to launch their crusades and jihads  whether it s one  holy city  or the other or the name of one prophet or messiah being used in vain  the  victims  that one is called to  fight  for are often abstract or anointed with some sort of summary hallowedness that resonates with a people who would rather believe stories than think through factual options  this is the intellectual cancer that the philippine opposition under the leadership of the liberal party  a k a  the yellowtards  continues to infest the nation s politics with  rather than encourage intellectual debate  the yellowtards continue to stunt and poison filipinos  minds with the same cult of personality influence peddling around which they define their angels and demons  so  in the minds of the yellowtards  the angels are those who live in the  heaven  of the perverse liberalism they espouse  and the demons live in the  hell  of the annoying rules that are now working against their agenda  what robredo and her minions are waging their  crusades  over are mere business as usual initiatives any government worth their salt would pursue   like sanctioning businesses such as rappler for baldly violating regulation  throwing in prison  senators  under whose watch as a former justice secretary drug use  trafficking  and administrative abuse proliferated in state correction facilities  revoking concessions given to  reporters  as a result of their employers  business compliance offenses  and removing  chief justices  who are clearly not qualified to head the judiciary  that s just plain old good housekeeping   something the shrillest of the shills who pass themselves off as the opposition s foremost  thought leaders  should understand at heart  truth be told  the opposition has not much intellectual capital to build strong counterarguments upon  their old voodoo platform of worshipping faces on  peso bills had been massively discredited in the  elections  they are now hard pressed to craft a new alternative pathway to the  strongman  rhetoric of the administration of philippine president rodrigo duterte that continues to be popular with millions of filipinos  suffice to say  the opposition have not stepped up to meet that higher challenge and are  instead  waging a reactive intellectually impoverished guerrilla war  indeed  guerrilla wars are romantic subjects for sob story  inspirational  dramas  some may even argue that the commies won the vietnam war using guerrilla tactics  but  see  filipinos are not like the vietnamese and the guerrilla cause their current opposition are desperately recruiting for exists only in the confused minds of  opposition  leaders like leni robredo  what is ironic is it is the very  influencers  of this  opposition  that continuously whine about the  weaponisation  of technology for political ends  we can understand where this mentality comes from now when we behold the absolute primitive approach they take in their political movements  this is  after all  the  century and it is pretty evident that the playing field has changed thanks to the very technology that these liberals once heralded as  well   game changing   funny how the more clever use of these technologies by their opponents so easily knocked the wind out of all that gushing about the new  citizen journalism   we can see here how every word uttered by leni robredo reveals the intellectual bankruptcy of the opposition she presumes to lead  the solution is therefore obvious  the opposition need to ditch robredo and  along with her  any trace of influence coming from the yellowtards her face  form  and vacuous substance represents  the clock is ticking towards the  elections and  soon  the next change in leadership  it is not too late for a real opposition to emerge   if the obvious solution is considered  that is ,1

1251,  it is under the harsh light of these unresolved allegations of electoral fraud that blights  that the mystery of how leni robredo  who supposedly beat rival bongbong marcos to the vice presidency then  could possibly trail the latter by such an enormous margin     as poll after poll conducted by reputable survey firms over the last several years confirm beyond reasonable doubt the dismal voter base of of opposition  leader  and presidential candidate leni robredo  the question of her role in the alleged electoral fraud that marred the  election comes back to bite  what happened in  remains shrouded in mystery  short of conspiring with the commission on elections  comelec  to cover up many instances of suspicious circumstances that surrounded the tallying and counting of election returns back then  robredo was at least a potential beneficiary of said fraud if it did occur  most telling is the flight to the united states   in the midst of the controversy   of no less than the comelec chairman at the time  andy bautista  how he managed to leave the country and  to this day  manage to fly under the radar of public and media scrutiny leads many to speculate that the conspiracy to whitewash the stink of electoral fraud that may have occurred in the  elections transcends partisan camps   from president rodrigo duterte s own seeming ambivalence to electoral reform and under whose watch bautista managed to escape to the us to the liberal party and today s opposition keeping mum on the matter  manila times columnist antonio contreras back in  wrote in his piece  again  where is andy bautista     until now  it is not entirely clear how the state could allow andy bautista to just roam around in comfortable self exile  when there is compelling evidence that the election process that he presided over was full of anomalies  and it is not just about straight lines of otherwise random votes  or of abnormally high percentage of undervotes which would have already sounded the alarm bell to any election scientist  we are talking here about actual evidence that points to tampering not only with the results but also with the process itself  election fraud whistleblower glenn chong presented to the public a procession of damning empirical data that screamed at the need for validation through a serious investigation  and which could no longer simply rely on the denials by comelec officials  vote counting machines that have already been tested and sealed were already transmitting a day before the elections  an illegal fourth server was established and has not been vetted properly  even as the source codes were not properly vetted according to procedures prescribed by law  shading thresholds of ballots were unilaterally changed by comelec without informing the parties  scanned ballot images are missing  or were apparently tampered with  causing the sequence number to exceed the total number of ballots cast  signatures of those who voted did not match those who are registered  ballot boxes were deliberately opened and tampered with  some drenched not only with water but with chemicals  and others stuffed with dirt  which was but apropos to the fact that our elections have been dirtied by fraud   fast forward to today  it is under the harsh light of these unresolved allegations of electoral fraud that blights  that the mystery of how leni robredo  who supposedly beat rival bongbong marcos to the vice presidency then  could possibly trail the latter by such an enormous margin in poll after poll baffles so many  where is that voter base today that could at least lend some semblance of credibility to her supposed victory over marcos in   where are those supporters who supposedly voted for leni robredo in   do they even exist  such is the enormous burden of proof that rests on robredo s shoulders today  no less than opposition  social news network  rappler itself  reports  that  leni robredo says defeating the dictator s son in the  presidential race will put to rest his lie that she cheated him in the  vice presidential contest   indeed  this is further proof that bongbong marcos is a key pillar of robredo s campaign and that without him  robredo s bid for the presidency literally has not a leg to stand on as she herself admits that she has to beat him to clear this whole mess up    kailangan talagang talunin siya sa susunod na eleksyon para once and for all  mahinto na yung ginagawa niya na pagpapapaniwala sa tao nung narrative na gusto niyang i push   robredo went on   he has to be defeated in the coming elections so that once and for all  his narrative  that he is pushing will stop    perhaps then it is time robredo be queried on what she really knows about why andy bautista managed to escape to the us  remains at large  and is a subject matter that seems to be a no go zone for her allies in big corporate media  what really happened in  and what accounts for the discrepancy between robredo s apparent performance in the  elections and her dismal preference ratings today  the mystery persists ,1

1256, if we really want to stop violence against women and children  vawc   it starts with us   pasig city mayor vico said this during his state of the children address on monday  nov    culminating the celebration of national children s month  addressing an audience of adults and children at the  children s summit  sotto emphasized the importance of overcoming fears to speak up against violence and vowing to never be perpetrators of these crimes   naiintindihan po natin na madalas po pag may nakikita tayong violence against women and children  ang default po natin ay medyo natatakot tayo na magsalita sa ating kapatid  magulang  o asawa  normal po na mangamba tayo o matakot  pero sana isipin po natin na kung gusto natin matigil talaga ito  it starts with us  una  na tayo mismo  hindi natin gagawin ang mga bagay na iyon  we understand that  usually  when we see violence against women and children  we feel scared to talk to our siblings  parents  or spouses about it  it is normal to feel doubtful and fearful  but if we really want to stop vawc  it starts with us  first  by committing that we will never do and enact harm     he said   kailangan rin po na pag may nakita o narinig tayo na kapitbahay natin binubugbog ang asawa o anak  sana po ay hindi tayo manahimik lamang  kung magbibingi bingihan o magbubulag bulagan tayo  hindi po matatapos ang problemang ito  when we see or hear of our neighbors abusing their spouse or their child  i hope we do not remain silent  these issues will never be solved if we pretend or insist on being blind or deaf to them    sotto added  the city government has mechanisms in place to address vawc such as the local council for the protection of children  lcpc  and the local council against trafficking and vawc  lcat vawc   all of which are subject to quarterly meetings  discussion  and adjustment of policies  however  the mayor stressed that citizens should not think of curbing vawc as the job and responsibility solely of the government  social welfare groups  or the police   kailangan po ay magtulungan tayo para po itaguyod ang mga karapatan ng ating mga kabataan para siguraduhin na ligtas sila sa kanilang mga kabahayan  paaralan  ang bawat isa po sa atin dito ay may papel at responsibilidad  lalo na po sa vawc  we have to work together to uphold the rights of our children to ensure their safety in their homes and schools  each one of us here has a role to play and a responsibility  especially in regards to vawc    sotto said  vac in numbers the pasig city local government continues to strengthen its programs and projects

daycare centers under the early childhood care and development  eccd  programs of the local government has decreased  from   in   to   in   the beneficiaries of the supervised neighborhood play  snp  program  has also grown to   in   compared to just  in   the growth of the snp  a form of daycare program aimed at improving the health of young kids  was attributed to the easing of pandemic restrictions and better conditions this year  sotto said they are working towards finding and accommodating other children who need daycare services  there are now  spaces considered  child friendly  in the city  there are  children being processed for adoption in   same as in   with the help of the cswd and the department of social welfare and development  dswd   meanwhile  the city s rescue processing center responds to more than  cases per year  there are  kids with  special cases   pertaining to child abuse and vawc  that local government bodies have referred to other agencies in   higher than the previous years  based on the central police station s records  sotto said there were  vawc cases from january to september    of which involved minors  eight of the  were cicls  sotto said he thinks the increase in the reported cases does not necessarily point to an increase in the instances of vawc or child abuse in pasig  rather  it can be an indication that more vawc cases are being reported to the authorities  with the national bureau of investigation  nbi   the local government  the cswd  and the pasig police have conducted numerous entrapment operations throughout the year to rescue trafficked or abused children in the city  sotto said  sotto said the nbi and the cswd caught and arrested  female potential victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation  two of whom are minors  last nov   at a ktv club in barangay ugong  pasig city  he also mentioned the case of a child sold by one of his parents for   to pay their e sabong debts last march  with the police  nbi  cswd  the child was found and is now safe  the three buyers were arrested and jailed  sotto enumerated other successful multi sectoral operations that resulted in the rescue of underaged victims from exploitative groups and individuals in pasig  many of whom were endorsed to childcare centers for physical and psychological support  while they have rescued and intervened in many cases  sotto said the data is still admittedly low given the severity and frequency of these crimes   hinihikayat ko po ang bawat isa na pag may impormasyon tayo  may nalalaman  nabalitaan  o may naririnig tayo   kahit konting ebidensya lang po   ilapit niyo na po sa amin kaagad at asahan niyo po na aaksyunan natin  ipapakulong po natin  if you have any information or knowledge  no matter how small the evidence is  i urge everyone to reach out and report to us immediately  rest assured we will take action on it  and we will put the perpetrators behind bars    sotto said  there may not be very high levels of human and child trafficking in pasig  but sotto remained firm in fighting these crimes  saying  one case is too many   in good hands despite the areas for improvement in the local government s efforts to stop cases of vawc  sotto said pasigueño children are  in good hands   the mayor praised the  city council  headed by the  strong willed and diligent  vice mayor robert  dodot  jaworski jr

1274,philippine national police chief gen  rodolfo azurin jr  said he suspected foul play might have been involved in the death of jun villamor  one of the alleged middlemen in the killing of radio commentator percival  percy lapid  mabasa  in a media briefing on monday  the pnp chief cast doubts on the sudden demise of villamor  who was a prisoner at new bilibid prison  nbp   saying  it s an unfortunate incident but the timing is questionable     the initial autopsy report did not specify the cause of his death  raising more suspicions among experts and observers  while bureau of corrections  bucor  spokesperson gabriel chaclag insisted he died of  cardiac arrest   villamor died on oct    a day after the surrender of joel escorial  the confessed gunman in the killing of mabasa who pointed to a certain crisanto villamor as the person who gave him the order to kill the radio commentator for    bucor said it did not have crisanto villamor on its list of inmates  but later noted that they were certain that escorial was referring to jun villamor  in his extrajudicial confession  escorial also tagged christopher bacoto  an inmate at the bureau of jail management and penology  bjmp   as well as brothers edmund and israel dimaculangan  and a certain orly  as his accomplices   it seemed somewhat incidental  that in the course of the ongoing investigation  suddenly this happened to the one we ve been looking for  right   azurin said   we were almost there  we have identified the triggerman and we have recovered pieces of evidence and this happened  we could have talked to villamor   he added  lamenting that they had expected bucor to have immediately  segregated  inmates bearing the villamor surname  so that escorial could personally identify the middleman  the pnp chief also seemed in disbelief at initial reports that villamor might have died in his sleep   bangungot     how can you sleep in bilibid at noontime  when i was a police captain  i had been entering the nbp and i ve seen the situation there  it s impossible to fall asleep because it s too hot and congested there  i wonder how he was able to fall asleep   he said  chaclag claimed in an interview with cnn philippines that they did not initially know that the alleged middleman was an nbp inmate and that they learned the pnp was looking for villamor only a day after his death    chaclag said villamor might have gotten nervous after seeing the news implicating him in mabasa s death while watching tv with other inmates  he said villamor had heart ailments and suffered chest pain in the past but refused to undergo a medical checkup  case still unsolved azurin likewise pointed out that the mabasa slay case was not yet solved  contrary to southern police district director brig  gen  kirby john kraft s earlier statement   although we have filed a case against escorial and his accomplices  we have yet to determine who is the mastermind and how it was planned in bilibid   he said  journalist roy mabasa said he  too  did not think it was  correct to assume the case  of his brother  has been solved  after police arrested escorial   until we get to the bottom of it  the mastermind  there is no such thing as a closed case   added the family s spokesperson  lawyer bertani causing  according to mabasa  he  his nieces  and nephews have also been receiving death threats from a man claiming to be an inmate from nbp since the suspected gunman has been revealed by the pnp  at first  he said the man contacted them via facebook messenger to say that he had an audio recording detailing how the suspects and the alleged middlemen inside nbp planned out mabasa s ambush on oct     of course  we did not believe him outright but as the family of the victim  we held onto every information we received  so initially i entertained him   mabasa said   then after a few days  he said he would only provide the audio in exchange for a certain amount   mabasa noted that the man told them through a mix of phone calls  video calls  and messages via messenger that he knew where they all lived  then the man started calling mabasa s children  and i don t know how they got their numbers     he kept telling us   huwag kayong papakasigurado  baka isunod kayo  don t be too complacent  you might be next     mabasa said  charges readied meanwhile  causing said that the mabasa family intended to file an administrative case against bucor director general gerald bantag for allowing mobile phones inside nbp which led to the murder of mabasa  escorial had said in a press conference on oct   that the  middlemen  contacted him from the facility to order the shooting of mabasa  although personnel and inmates in prison facilities are prohibited from using cell phones  as for the criminal charge  the family may file a case over the director s alleged reckless imprudence resulting in murder  according to causing  bantag is under a  day preventive suspension to guarantee the impartial investigation of the death of villamor  as ordered by president marcos  said justice secretary jesus crispin remulla  the pnp is also looking into at least  personalities  including bantag  who were frequently targeted by mabasa in more than  posts that it has reviewed since   as persons of interest   there are more or less  different personalities  politicians  military  and police officers  we re currently looking at their probable link to the death of percy   azurin said  ,0

alluded to the general terms of the  philippine us mutual defense treaty  mdt   saying  an armed attack on the philippines armed forces  public vessels  or aircraft in the south china sea would invoke us mutual defense commitments    and that is an unwavering commitment that we have to the philippines   she said  another basis of bilateral relations  the american vice president added  was mutual

sen  ronald dela rosa  however  called on the us government to fully commit to the mdt with the philippines   that  harris visit  is an indicator that they are really here for us because otherwise  they could just be ignoring us  but the relationship should be mutual and not one sided   he said  sen  christopher go said visiting dignitaries from allied countries were welcome  especially if these would usher in more support for the philippines such as the modernization of the armed forces of the philippines  in the house of representatives  cagayan de oro rep  rufus rodriguez noted that the visit of harris sent a clear signal to china that the philippines has us support in the south china sea dispute  however  gabriela women s party list said that harris  visit to palawan might be seen

1384,chinese loans for three multibillion peso railway projects that were to be major legacies of former president rodrigo duterte under his  build  build  build  program have been scrapped as his administration bowed out  a transport official said on friday  president marcos is looking at renegotiating the loans with beijing in the hope of securing the official development assistance loans as the government has no money to fund these projects  said undersecretary for railways cesar chavez of the department of transportation  dotr     manila s loan applications with state owned china eximbank for the three big ticket railways are deemed withdrawn after former finance secretary carlos dominguez iii  canceled the application instead of keeping it in suspended animation  due to the bank s inaction  chavez said   considered withdrawn  the financing was for contracts which were already awarded covering the first package of the philippine national railways  pnr  bicol project  the subic clark railway project  scrp  and the first phase of the mindanao railway project  mrp   the chinese government had not approved the loan applications that were submitted by the philippine government in    chavez told reporters on friday  the department of finance  dof  wrote to china eximbank in may telling it that if it did not act on the country s loan applications by the end of that month  these should be  considered withdrawn   he said   dotr understands that this is in light of the upcoming transition of government  and in deference to the incoming administration   chavez said in a statement later   percent interest china also did not provide the philippines a shortlist of contractors and consultants for the projects  which is a prerequisite for a loan agreement  he said  chavez said that the dotr requested the list to show that it was keen on proceeding with getting chinese financing for the projects  the loans would be settled only after the philippines chooses contractors and consultants from the shortlist but the chinese bank did not respond  he explained   in short  china backed out   chavez said  the transport official said that the chinese bank also was asking for  percent interest on the loans  much higher than the   percent rate charged by japan  with the government not having enough funds to finance the projects  the marcos administration would be considering the public private partnership scheme as a financing option which it was banking to drive public infrastructure spending over the next six years  chavez said    the first package of the pnr bicol project  with a cost of  billion  will link calamba in laguna to daraga  albay  via a  kilometer railway  this will cover the design  construction and electromechanical works of the project  dof concern the  billion scrp is a   km link between subic bay freeport zone and clark freeport zone and would transport both freight and passengers  the  billion mrp s first phase covers the  km tagum davao digos route  envisioned to be the first rail line across mindanao  it was expected to be completed by   and would reduce travel time to about an hour from   hours currently  on its own  the government could not finance the projects as the pandemic ravaged the economy and left it with less funds for any additional spending without undermining its overall financial standing  asked if the government would seek loans from other agencies instead  chavez declined to comment given that this was the concern of the finance department  revisit projects the marcos administration will check if potential loans from china for the three railway projects would still be feasible  according to finance secretary benjamin diokno   the new administration can revisit the projects   diokno said on friday   if found worthwhile  it may choose to restore the loan application  if funding is still available   president marcos  chief economic manager did not reply when asked to comment on concerns that chinese financing pledges for philippine projects had been slow  even at the height of closer manila beijing ties during the duterte administration  samal davao city connector in its last month in office  the duterte administration borrowed   billion renminbi  about   billion  from china to build a bridge connecting the former president s hometown davao city to samal island in davao gulf  this was china s last loan to the duterte government and also its first official development assistance  oda  denominated in the chinese currency  in the past  the country s oda loans from china were denominated in us dollars  as the philippines wanted parity and comparable interest rates with oda loans from countries like japan and south korea as well as multilateral lenders   this loan was slapped with an interest rate of  percent per annum  payable in  years plus a seven year grace period  this chinese financing for the four lane samal island davao city connector will bankroll  percent of the project s design and build contract amounting to   billion  in all  the duterte administration borrowed from china a total of    billion  michael ricafort  chief economist at rizal commercial banking corp   said that the withdrawal of the funding would be a blow not only to the projects but to the economy  too   delayed funding for these large infrastructure projects in the country from china would mean slower economic growth   and would also delay the economic growth and development in these rural areas along the path of these infrastructure projects   he said  the railway projects are seen to connect more areas in the countryside  which can spur economic activities all along their routes   disappointing  sunny sevilla  a former finance undersecretary who is coconvenor of move as one coalition  maoc   told the inquirer that the funding withdrawal was  disappointing  as the public had been led to believe that these projects would proceed   sevilla said it  would be good to better understand why the chinese government no longer wishes to fund these projects  whether that decision was prompted by their assessment of the projects  economic and financial viability   urging the government as well to share its plans with the public   in the meantime  we earnestly hope that the government will ensure that there is sufficient and reasonably priced road transport capacity to meet the needs of travelers who would have traveled between subic and clark  to bicol  and in mindanao   the maoc coconvenor said   ,0

1395,  on what legal basis is the office of a senator authorised to take custody of persons of interest in an on going crime investigation   according to this inquirer report  senator risa hontiveros   with the help of an institution   took custody of the family of kian delos santos who was allegedly killed by police officers in a botched anti drug operation  according to the same report   witnesses  to this killing were also taken by hontiveros s office  it seems hontiveros  in so doing  could be guilty of the following offenses     illegal detention  and     tampering with and witholding evidence from the police  on what legal basis is the office of a senator authorised to take custody of persons of interest in an on going crime investigation  in a tweet fielded by hontiveros she said that  my office will provide full protection   security to the family   witnesses   whatever legal service is needed   but does the legislature possess legal authority to provide services that agencies from within the executive branch of government   such as the police   already provide  philippine congress  after all  is a legislative body  and does not have executive function in government  furthermore  congress does not have authority to issue summary judgments on the quality of the way the police conduct their operations  issuing judgments is the job of the judicial branch of the government  yet hontiveros s colleagues in congress are seemingly in violation of this basic constitutional tenet  even going as far as suggesting   without proof   that philippine president rodrigo duterte  masterminds  the  daily carnage  of the on going  war on drugs    trillanes and detained sen  leila de lima scoffed at president duterte s order for an investigation of the boy s killing   the chief investigator and mastermind of the daily carnage ordering a probe into the kian killing  what a farcical joke   de lima said in a statement   indeed  there is the irony in the way the philippine opposition dish out their shrill protests around the  trending  hashtag  justiceforkian on social media  crying bloody  extrajudicial  this and  extrajudicial  that  even as their own leaders wantonly violate every basic step in criminal investigation due process  it raises the question of whether the opposition s primary thesis against the duterte government   that it is  authoritarian  in nature is even true to begin with  the fact is  there is no actual breakdown in state democratic functions at all  what seems to be the real bone of contention is whether or not filipinos  as a people  are at their best when working within  democratic  frameworks  stupid politicians   such as hontiveros and her ilk   who  themselves  seem to lack a fundamental understanding of the very laws they supposedly create and maintain are  in fact  products of a currently functional democracy  if we break that function into its component parts  here is what we get    voters elect their executives and legislators    legislators craft amend laws representing the interests of their constituents    executives implement and enforce these laws    voters review evaluate outcomes achivements coming out of    and       on the basis of    determine of politicians are good or bad    goto    note in the above action feedback loop how voters play a key role in ensuring that quality is an emergent property as their society cycles through each iteration of this process every several years  the democratic process already exists to support the above cycle  it is the quality of the input provided by filipinos  via elections  that determines the quality of the products of this cycle  government officials like hontiveros  are the unfortunate products of this system  indeed  the  functioning state  exists both institutionally and in practice in the philippines  and yet the outcomes remain dysfunctional  so it seems the more confronting discussion should be around what an alternative definition for the notion of a  functioning state  could be  the opposition insists that the definition should lie along the lines of it being  liberal democratic   an alternative could be something more appropriate for an urgent need to temper the idiocy of the electorate and mitigation of the flawed thinking that prevails when their definition is in effect  funny enough  people like risa hontiveros who  according to the hymn book she sings off upholds  liberal democracy  are the ones who force filipinos to question whether liberal democracy   as enshrined in the yellowtard constitution of    is actually the right system for filipinos ,1

1456,the buzzword these days in social media is estate tax and the so called  the marcoses owe to the bir in particular and the government in general  if yorme isko or manny becomes president  they expressed intention to collect the money owed by the marcoses to the government and use it in the government s post covid recovery program  but the questions are  do the marcoses really have to issue a bank check or pay in cash to the bir if indeed they owe  estate tax  what is bbm s complicity to the issue  i am no expert on this so let us read the fb post of atty  bruce rivera who clarified that he is not a marcos apologist but the hullabaloo surrounding the unpaid estate taxes has become so unfair  it needs a good tongue lashing  in the same fb post  atty  rivera also mentioned yorme isko and asked a hypothetical question how he feels if his children will be asked to pay estate taxes in the event of his passing since he heard  rumor  he allegedly owned divisoria  of course yorme isko does not own divisoria  i suspect atty  rivera said this to drive home his point that the marcoses are just rumored to own some of these contested properties and yet they were asked to pay estate taxes  at one point in atty  rivera s post  he mentioned imee marcos swearing they do not own a certain real estate and now they are already in the hands of certain rich families  you may now read atty  rivera s easy to follow explanation of estate tax for your education  estate tax and bbm i am not a marcos apologist but the hulabaloo regarding unpaid estate tax has become so unfair  it needs tongue lashing  an estate is a juridical person that serves as an extension of the personality of a dead person for the purpose of collecting and paying debts and distributing what remains thereof to the legal or compulsory heirs  basahin ang kaso ni limjuco vs  the estate of pedro fragante  what is now the implication of this  first  the estate has the duty to pay taxes  the estate which are the property left by ferdinand e  marcos pays for it  not the heirs  not imelda  not imee  not bbm  because before they can even have the properties transferred to their names  taxes have to be settled  second  when the state collects estate taxes on a dead man s properties  it presupposes that the property subject of the tax is owned by the deceased  hence  if the state has assessed estate taxes  it is deemed an admission by the state that marcos  the father is the rightful owner  problem is  there are so many properties alleged to be owned by fm but disputed by the government  hindi naman siguro tama kung pababayaran ang estate tax ng isang bahay na kay marcos daw tapos may adverse claim na nakaw na yaman ito  some of the properties are real estate that imee knows they never owned and are already in the hands of other rich families  two points  if indeed ownership is no longer in question  the state can easily levy or take the said properties  and the estate tax should have been considered paid  problem is  even if the sc has ruled that fm estate owes estate taxes  the bir could not levy it because the ownership is disputed  and even if may assessment na  the period to default will only begin to run once ownership is finally settled  and what is bbm complicity in all of these  wala  he is just the son  legal heir and administrator  wala siyang utang na estate tax kasi ang estate ni late president ang may responsibilidad magbayad nun  kung bakit hindi makolekta at hindi maremata ng gobyerno sa matagal na panahon ay dapat tinatanong sa bir at hindi ginagawang issue kay bbm at sa pamilya  at sa mga nagsasabiing bayaran na lang  ito ang ibabalik kong tanong  kayo ba  babayaran mo ang buwis sa isang bahay na sinasabi ng gobyerno ay hindi sa yo  kung oo ang sagot mo  tanga ka lang  at itatanong ko kay isko  paano kung sisingilin ang anak mo ng gobyerno ng estate tax sa divisoria after ka matigok dahil ikaw daw may ari  matutuwa ba ang kaluluwa mo  the reason bbm popularity is growing can be explained in very simple terms  if you see a man kicked  punched  stabbed  choked and mob lynched to the point of absurdity that it is beyond the notion of retribution for the sins of his family  it will go to a level of oppression that will force those who could not care less to speak up and protect this man  because humanity has no political color  ,1

1474,  the important lesson lost on the yellowtards is that you cannot make converts out of people you demonise as part of a foolish strategy to win political points  in a democracy  the ultimate goal is to win votes     apologists of singer jim paredes are in a state of profound confusion  as the scandal surrounding a private video of paredes that somehow fell into the wrong hands and got shared all over social media unfolded  his supporters  mostly members of the current opposition camp  went from first attempting to suppress discussion by making the topic taboo within their online circles  then  as the authenticity of the video became evident  responding with whataboutisms relative to the  crimes  of the duterte administration  then  recently  issuing calls to investigate what most agree is a serious crime against paredes s privacy  stepping back further  it is important to note that the initial response of paredes when queried about the video was to claim the video was  fake   that alone puts in doubt the sincerity of his subsequent apology  since that  apology   paredes has remained silent  but not his apologists  for many observers who may have found it in themselves to empathise with paredes s plight  that initial bout of sympathy evaporated amidst the din of the self righteous pomposity of his apologists who took it upon themselves to speak for him and  true to form  demonise those who continued to discuss the matter  one interesting idea raised by no less than opm legend leah navarro is that the person or persons involved in obtaining and spreading the video should be charged  indeed  a full investigation should be launched so that charges could be laid and the perps involved in this invasion of privacy prosecuted  but that will involve finding out who was at the other end of jim paredes s video chat  so perhaps navarro needs to give a bit more thought to what exactly she is calling for  would paredes even co operate in such an investigation  evidently the way forward for the yellowtards is to put a positive spin on the  scandal   something that paul john caña attempts in his esquire piece it shouldn t be a big deal that jim paredes is  and likes to engage in online sex  caña writes   engaging in a private sexual encounter online is his right as a  very  mature adult  and something no one should fault him for just because he s past retirement age  that it was made public is unfortunate  but we shouldn t get our panties all up in a wad just because we find out that a  year old is still a horndog who likes using modern technology to satisfy his urges   fair enough  and perhaps this is the path forward the rest of yellowtardom should have taken rather than lash out at the rest of filipinodom who engage in a bit of schadenfreude made easy by paredes s track record of holier than thou posturing  the important lesson lost on the yellowtards is that you cannot make converts out of people you demonise as part of a foolish strategy to win political points  in a democracy  the ultimate goal is to win votes and not antagonise those who are potential sources of that important poltical resource  jim paredes s apologists should take pause and reflect on the real outcomes of their perverted apologism  rather than win people over to agree that paredes s frailties are human traits we all share  the yellowtards have  instead  drawn an even harder line between them and us ,1

1483,  bolet banal  would arguably be if president duterte were to step down before his term expired in   the most powerful man in the country  as he would be the last person robredo would talk to at the end of each day    members of the philippine opposition are coming to the defense of their  hero  and presumptive  vice president  leni robredo following a column by writer bobi tiglao published on the manila times today  according to tiglao  robredo has so far failed to confirm or deny whether she is having an affair with house representative of quezon city s third district  jorge   bolet   banal who is married  both banal and robredo have  according to tiglao so far refused to comment or give a straightforward answer to reporters  requests for comment   in media convention  or simply out of sheer rationality  a refusal to confirm or deny a report is interpreted as a confirmation  unless it is preposterously baseless  or is predicated on a falsehood   the main argument of robredo s supporters is that this is none of the filipino public s business  however  as tiglao points out  this is an issue of national consequence considering that banal  would arguably be if president duterte were to step down before his term expired in   the most powerful man in the country  as he would be the last person robredo would talk to at the end of each day   more importantly  robredo routinely exhibits her devoutness to her catholic faith in public displays of piety much of which is conveniently staged in front of reporters  cameras  but the most pious of the roman catholic faithful frowns upon liberal expression of one s sexuality and engaging in sexual acts outside of marriage  as such  given the public persona robredo cultivates for her and her party s poltical ends  her alleged relationship with banal  an illicit one within the frame of the catholic faith if it has been consumated  is a matter of consequence to her constituents  when one openly exhibits religiosity  the increased scrutiny into one s private life is par for the course  this is the reason sex scandals involving religious leaders and the pious are such lucrative fodder for the media   because people just love stories about the pious and the judgmental falling from grace  the question robredo therefore needs to answer if she insists on not  humouring  the matter of her alleged affair with banal is why  why is it important that she keep her relationship  or lack of relationship  with banal a secret  is it because robredo is afraid of being judged  does her value as a politician and public servant rest entirely on her ascendancy as a devout catholic  what does this say about her regard for ordinary filipinos who are also in a similar situation  does she presume to judge people who may be in such a situation  as the presumptive second most powerful filipino  it is telling the way robredo shrinks from the responsibility of being forthright to her constituents about her personal life  as a public official and personality  robredo should recognise that with that role comes responsibility of ensuring the consistency the public expects of a leader  in australia  a scandal involving the extramarital affairs of former deputy prime minister barnaby joyce sparked a similar debate on how much the media should be reporting about the personal lives of public figures  the principles at stake at the centre of this debate are no different   in politics  convention has long been that there needs to be a public interest  such as a misuse of public money involved  for an affair to be deemed newsworthy  or when there is a rank hypocrisy that begs to be exposed  an mp who moralises about the sanctity of marriage and family values  while philandering on the side  is a ripe target   clearly  leni robredo fits the mold of the latter  she needs to face the confronting question once and for all  indeed  though her most vocal supporters prefer that she dismisses these speculations  it is quite likely that much of the interest around this aspect of her personal life comes from within her community of supporters  after all  it is her supporters who are the biggest stakeholders in how consistent robredo s practices are to what she preaches ,1

1517,  leni robredo came across as not well informed about the status of the compensation claims of martial law victims  she just sounded like a broken record  she doesn t have anything much against marcos jr     the one and only vice presidential debates hosted by cnn philippines became mostly about senator bongbong marcos  if not for marcos jr  the debates would have been boring  it seems most people just want to hear from him and what he has to say  well  except of course for the hecklers who kept interrupting him by chanting  never again   the irony of what the members of the never again movement are doing escapes them  they complain about human rights abuses but are also quick to deny an individual s right to presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial  they are not even good at following rules  they kept heckling even when the rules from organizers were clear against heckling and interrupting the proceedings  they behaved like they were an audience in a gladiator ring   uncivilized  the members of the never again movement do not want to listen to what marcos jr had to say because they are afraid they could be proven wrong  his rivals like congresswoman leni robredo kept bringing up the victims of martial law even when their cases have already been settled  they didn t bother to understand what marcos jr was saying about the status of the settlement  it turns out that the current government under president benigno simeon aquino is the one delaying granting reparation claim  in the last two years since the law granting the compensation was enacted  hardly anything has been done   it seems bs aquino s law was simply for public relations purposes   to make him look compassionate to so called victims of martial law  but this is only on paper and was not followed through by action   samahan ng ex detainees laban sa detensyon at aresto or selda said the delay in granting the compensation  reflects how the aquino government treats human rights victims then and now   as it noted that instead of diminishing  the number of human rights violations has increased in the waning months of the current administration  it also pointed out aquino has yet to name a replacement for former hrvcb member chito gascon  who is now chairman of the commission on human rights  causing even more delays in the panel s work   leni robredo came across as not well informed about the status of the compensation claims of martial law victims  she just sounded like a broken record  she doesn t have anything much against marcos jr except for atrocities allegedly committed by his family during martial law  she is irrational when it comes to putting marcos jr down  maybe that s from hanging out too much with an irrational crowd like the never again advocates  the problem with robredo is she is too beholden to the aquino name  she keeps turning a blind eye to atrocities committed during aquino s term  she promotes her platform and ideas on how to solve the country s problems while ignoring the fact that the country s problems worsened in the last six years  at least the other vp candidates acknowledge the current government s shortfalls  robredo may have good ideas but being associated with the liberal party is pulling her down  senator alan peter cayetano acted like he was in a senate hearing  he was acting like a mad dog spewing baseless accusations against his rivals  he spoke as if he is not corrupt  he probably thinks the public hasn t read the news item about the commission on audit asking both him and his sister to return unused pork barrel funds    pursuant thereto  the unutilized unused  pdaf funds for the period cy  to  from the legislator proponents of different projects in the amount of      as of december    as shown in the subsidiary ledgers should not be disbursed and has to be remitted to the bureau of the treasury  btr     coa said in its report  coa said alan has to return  million of the  million pork funds he gave to the city  the pork funds were for the purchase of  multi cab units worth  million  construction of north signal village health center worth  million  financial assistance for indigent patients in taguig city hospital and western bicutan for   million  financial assistance to families in crisis worth  million  and construction of  multi purpose buildings for   million   cayetano came across like a hypocrite  he is against political dynasties but is married to taguig mayor lani cayetano  he is also the brother of senator pia cayetano  no wonder the voters do not like him  he is so unpopular in surveys even when he is already teamed up with davao city mayor rodrigo duterte  who has become second most popular presidential candidate  all the other vice presidential candidates were so boring  senator chiz escudero is only popular because he is married to a beautiful young actress heart evangelists  there is nothing special about his ideas of governance  he is also into patronage politics  we recall that he was one of the senator judges who voted to impeach former chief justice renato corona even when as a lawyer  he should have known that the charges against him were trumped up and that information used against him were gathered illegally especially when anti money laundering council divulged his bank accounts without corona s consent  senator trillanes spoke about his ideas like fixing the traffic problems as if it was as easy as installing another light rail transit  the government cannot even manage the maintenance of the metro rail system properly but he wants to add more of them  it s quite bizarre why trillanes is running for the vice presidency when he knows he is not popular  he should still be serving his jail term for rebellion  the only reason bs aquino pardoned him was because he was jailed during former president gloria arroyo s term  we all know bs aquino hates arroyo  trillanes s enemy is bs aquino s enemy  another vice presidential candidate who does not have a chance of winning is senator gringo honasan  as much as he appears to have sound ideas  his charm with the crowd has faded  the sparkle in his eyes is gone  he doesn t seem relevant to the voters anymore  i doubt if any of the members of the audience actually listened to what he had to say  it doesn t help that he is associated with vice president jejomar binay  sometimes that s all it takes to lose  just ask mar roxas who is associated with bs aquino  the vp debates are more entertaining than the presidential debates  frankly  the vice president is not really going to make a difference in the policies of the president particularly when the president is from a different political party  but if duterte wins and fails to curb criminality within six months as promised  he might turn over the presidency to his vice president marcos jr  assuming the latter wins the vp  in a democracy  the voters will decide on that ,1

1533,victory on hair length  not so fast can only be done if deped s guidelines in the development of learners  discipline manual would be amended  the recent celebration that hair length is no longer an issue in schools is  i would say  an empty talk  i also thought the hair length issue is down the bin  but as i did further research  it is far from over  under the duterte administration  deped order   s   was issued  to promote the protection of children from all forms of gender related violence  abuse  exploitation  discrimination  and bullying  and to promote gender equality and non discrimination in the workplace and within the deped   this memorandum has been the basis of the  nohaircutpolicy that gained ground on social media  which aimed to question the hair length policy specifically for male students   victory was declared when an august    deped memorandum was released  which simply reiterated the deped order   s    miss mela habijan  declared   we finally won the battle  lgbtqia  kids  simula sa araw na ito  malaya na tayong maging tayo sa paaralan   however  the fight is far from over   there s is nothing in deped order   s   and deped memorandum of  august  that address the haircut policy  in fact  deped has a standing policy based on decs manual  on haircut of male students  this policy is reflected in the  deped guidelines in the development of learners  discipline manual   every regional division of deped issues these guidelines  which then becomes part of the student handbook  specifically  the guidelines states that   the haircut for boys shall be at least one    inch above the ear and three    inches above the collar line   deped order   s   has not changed this policy at all  it s interesting that the advocates trumpeting themselves as champions over this issue have not even mentioned the existence of the  deped guidelines in the development of learners  discipline manual   which has a rule on hair length for male students  which has never been changed by any deped order  certainly  there are public schools   and even private schools   that do not enforce this policy  you would be lucky if you are studying there   however  for lasting  uniform  and consistent change to occur nationwide  the deped guidelines in the development of learners  discipline manual must be amended to reflect a hair length policy for male students that doesn t re enforce gender stereotypes  which have nothing to do in improving the academic and behavioural performance of students  so inday sara duterte  madame vp and deped secretary  beke nemen po   ,1

1536,icymi  historian ambeth ocampo chided young actress ella cruz for comparing  history  to chismis  gossip  because it is filtered and even exaggerated as a result  the public is denied of real history  the idea is there but it can be denied  there is bias  cruz said  ambeth ocampo  a filipino historian as per philstar s own words didn t like ella cruz s opinion and as i ve said  chided the young actress  one of the casts of viva films  maid in malacanang  of director darryl yap  don t confuse history with chismis  history may have bias but it is based on facts not opinion  real history is about truth  not lies  not fiction  ambeth ocampo wrote  enter atty  nick of the fb page nick nangit   ncn law  atty  nick minces no words in calling ambeth ocampo  ambitious  person  someone who likes to lift his own chair  who just answered back but his arguments were erroneous  why  because he is one of the guardians of the dilawan  that s why  basically  atty  nick  arguments to back up his assertion that ambeth ocampo s statement are full of holes or errors  let me just focus on the first of  parts  atty  nick defended ella from the get go  saying she was simply using a figure a of speech when she compared history to chismis or gossiping  atty  nick slammed ambeth ocampo for telling ella not to confuse history with chismis when it appears he is the one looking confused  not ella  atty  nick explained by citing an example  like  when someone says he is like roderick paulate  it does not mean he is roderick paulate  he just looks like roderick paulate  just a resemblance  so when some is looking for you and said you look like roderick paulate  for sure  the person being asked will point to your direction  after proving his argument that ambeth ocampo s statements are erroneous  atty  nick proceeded to lecture ambeth ocampo that writing history is not without bias  especially so when no one really knew the entire story and the the historian writing history lacks necessary data  hence he will just form his own opinion  besides  history is always written by the victors  it would be unthinkable that the victor will paint the loser as a hero  atty  nick ended the long fb rant by challenging ambeth ocampo to know the real story behind ninoy and pnoy aquino s death so that he will have some use for the  million voters of pbbm  yellow historian etong ambethyoso nato  na mahilig mag angat ng sariling bangko  hihirit lang mali mali pa  bakit  e dahil isa sya sa mga tagabantay ng mga dilawang poootah    ang sabi ni ella  like   hindi nya sinabing  history is chismis   ang tawag diyan ay  simile   isa siyang  figure of speech   kinukumpara lang niya ang kasaysayan sa tsismisan  bakit may pa confuse ka pang nalalaman e mukhang ikaw ang na confuse  parang ganito lang yan  kung sasabihin ko  ambethoso is like roderick paulate  hindi ibig sabihin ikaw siya  kamukha mo lang o yun bang may similarities kayo  kapag may naghahanap sa inyo at dinescribe si roderick paulate na kamukha nung dambuhalang pakalat kalat  malamang ituturo ka  getz mo    totoo naman ang sinabi ni ella  habang may buhay tayong lahat  may kanya kanyang opinyon ang bawa t isa  dapat igalang ang pananaw  wala naman siyang sinasabi na tumataliwas sa mga eme eme mo  bakit ka affected  dahil lamang kasama siya sa pelikula  dahil lamang may pelikulang maglalahad na ng kabilang bahagi ng mga kuwentong dilaw  ayaw niyo bang malaman ang buong kwento  para lang yan sa away ng mag asawa  hindi isang panig lang ang pakikinggan  dapat parehong panig ay pakinggan  doon malalaman ang buong kwento  ang mahirap sa inyong mga hinehepa  ambethyoso  e gusto nyo isang panig lang ang ikalat at ituro  mali yun  kahit sa korte o sa kumpisal  pakikinggan ang dapat pakinggan    ansave mo  ambethyso   history may have bias  but it is    not opinion   pag bias  ibig sabihin may kinikilingan  yan pa lamang pagkiling na yan ay pagpili na ng pinaniniwalaan  kaya t lilitaw ang opinyon  dahil nga kinakailangang tumugma ang pagkiling sa paniniwala    lahat ng naisulat na kasaysayan ay may kinikilingan  halimbawa  sa paggamit pa lamang ng pang uri  kapag may namatay sa isang monarkiya  depende sa manunulat kung gagamitin niya ang salitang  pinatay  o  napatay   kung gusto niya ang pumatay  sasabihin niya   napatay sa digmaan ang hari   kung ayaw naman niya sa pumatay  sasabihin niya   pinatay ang hari   magkaiba ang mabubuo sa kaisipan ng magbabasa  sa una  ikatutuwa ng magbabasa ang kamatayan  dahil matapang at pinaglaban nang nagwagi  kaya napatay ang hari  sa ikalawa  ikagagalit ng magbabasa ang kamatayan  dahil may masamang ginawa sa hari  ano ang ibig sabihin nito  na ang pagsusulat ng kasaysayan ay laging may kinikilingan  lalo pa t kung walang nakaaalam ng buong nangyari o kung kulang ang datos  kaya bubuo na lamang ng opinyon  at saka  ang kasaysayan ay laging isinusulat ng nagwagi sa tunggalian  alangan namang isulat ng nanalo na magaling at hangaan ang natalo  walang permanente sa mundo  maging ang kasaysayan ay hindi permanente  pag may naungkat na bagong datos  kinakailangang baguhin  dagdagan  o iwasto ang kasaysayan  halimbawa  kung nakasulat sa kasaysayan na walang anak ang isang reyna  subali t lumabas kalaunan  lumantad  at sinuri pa na mayroon nga  itatanggi mo pa ba na  base sa mga naunang datos e  wala pa ring anak  huwag

awtoridad sa usapin ng kasaysayan  maraming awtoridad  at hindi lahat kayo ay pare pareho ang opinyon  at lagi nga kayong nagtatalu talo  kung ang mga mismong saksi sa isang pangyayari ay nagtatalu talo  yun pa kayang mga wala doon at ibabalita na lang   mahilig ka lang magsaliksik  period  pwes  alamin mo kung sino ba pumatay kay ninoy at kung bakit kinremate si noynoy  para may silbi ka sa

1538, she can t lead the liberal party yet she will be effective with the philippines   she can t blame internal politics  there are none now  there was nothing to leave  how can you not hold leni generally responsible for the liberal party falling off a cliff   i am guessing the bulk of the population already made up their mind who they are for may   yet that fact is not going to stop nauseating campaigning for all the parties and candidates  it is a fact of filipino culture which i documented last election  there is no campaign discussed more the same way miller light was discussed in classic beer commercials than the robredo  cuneta pangalinan campaign    there are better places in grp that detail the gulf between reality and illusion  before i live up to my click bait title   let s go through some other reasons why the thought of leni robredo as our next president makes many people throw up in their mouth  leni was responsible for the well being of the liberal party  that is past tense because this election there is no liberal party  at least in name  to show you how fast things change in politics   the liberal party elected a president  years ago   in the here and now   that president has become radioactive    leni lovers  tell us the philippines will be a paradise with her as president  like noynoy before her  leni rose to prominence from necropolitics  nothing like a death in the family to get people to care who you are so you can get votes  the liberal party playbook  if they didn t notice you in life   then point to a dead relative or two  noynoy had no contributions in the senate or congress  leni had zero contributions in the courtroom  leni s camp tries to shake off the unintelligent label by naming honorary degrees and what her kids did  why can t they show videos of her making sense  instead her campaign prefer we see videos of her doing all this  therein  lies the rub  she was the most visible member of the liberal party and they imploded  she can t lead the liberal party yet she will be effective with the philippines   she can t blame internal politics  there are none now  there was nothing to leave  how can you not hold leni generally responsible for the liberal party falling off a cliff  how is that hollow shell of a party not about her leadership  perseverance  competence and resourcefulness   the fate of that party says a lot about leni and what she is and is not about  the liberal party disappeared because nobody there was worth it   including leni   eight years ago i wrote this piece on the importance of symbols when it comes to national identity  leni thinks simply changing her color will rid her persona of the stench of the liberal party  noynoy  that complete moron only supported something the liberal party had total control of  using that stupid yellow ribbon for his entire term   he was telling you the country did not matter at all  it is the symbol of the party and the interests of the party that comes before all   why do you think neither noynoy or the liberal party stood the test of time  it is entirely comforting that leni followed that same tactic  years later   shows you why i never liked her  more than a few people agree  mar in  dubbed himself noynoy     he even cried when the president endorsed him before the election that year  weird though how he was so cavalier on the ground in tacloban during the yolanda aftermath  he even told cnn s audience   there was no cnn philippines in   that  president aquino was known as   pnoy   what a stupid thing to have in your head with all the corpses and misery around him  leni believes drugs should be decriminalized   leni believes manny pacquaio would make a good president   leni believes communist supporters should be given a seat at the table when it comes to policy making  leni believes it is ok to publicize that her daughter was in an alleged sex video that has yet to materialize just so she can blame bbm  leni believes it is okay to use the lord s altar to campaign alongside a non catholic  leni believes it is okay to change running mates with a month to go in the election    leni believes auschwitz is a nice place for a photo opportunity  my question to you  is it okay to believe in a person who believes all that  leni can not avoid the mar roxas   stink   they were running mates in  and were on the ballot as  daang matuwid   a name you never hear bandied about today  maybe because the practitioners proved to be very ineffective so they ditched the name  anything noynoy brought to the table since   is as treasured as a soiled condom  the only one who does not see it that way is kris aquino  her brother has been dead almost a year and it s only now on stage that we find out that there is an unpublished  letter from the grave vouching for leni s authenticity  ksp is the root of all evil  since    noynoy  mar or leni force fed you all the liberal party rhetoric and symbols and songs  the problem is that in the proceeding  years what can we point to from them and their cohorts that materialized from their yellow brainwashing   the same stagnant signs and slogans but nothing tangible  the same people telling you to vote leni told you to vote noynoy  how did that work out   how is the liberal party doing   the boy cried wolf too much  a long time ago san miguel had a beer called lager light which went the way of the tetradactyl  well the brand went extinct but apparently the exact same beverage changed it s name to san miguel light and is the easiest beer to find in any restaurant in manila that serves beer  i personally do not think san mig light  is a quality beer but it proves that things can be effectively rebranded    changing yellow to pink does not solve everything  it doesn t matter what color you wear   it only matters what you are   leni believes lightning will strike twice  that this election she will be san mig light going from yellow to pink  leni of course learned from the best when it comes to necropolitics  nobody could name one thing noynoy ever did as a senator or congressman before august   nobody could name one thing leni did as a lawyer prior to may    leni back in june tipped her toe in the necropolitics pool trying to cash the cash the chips of the clueless one s death  the house it seems is not honoring those chips and that lead to the disintegration of the liberal party   noynoy exploited his mother s timely death  leni would exploit noynoy s death if there was anything to exploit  i have laid out a plethora of reasons why voting for leni would be insane  personally the ultimate reason you can trust leni as far as you can throw franklin drilon is the nonchalant way she looked at the events of august    rico puno by all accounts was loved and trusted by noynoy  fact  he resigned because of a breaking and entering incident at the manila apartment of jesse robredo while his plane was still missing  i doubt any of you relish your home being broken into  i also doubt any of you would enjoy the timing of that break in coinciding with a moment in time your spouse s life is in doubt  all that is fact  just based on the facts   i have simple questions  others have taken the facts and have their own questions and their own conclusions  grp s ramon ortoll discussed them here  he also believes leni to be a train wreck of a politician  then again what good politician would align themselves with noynoy   manuel  boy  mejorada raises his own questions when it comes to the fatal flight that took the life of leni s husband  really worth the  minutes   even if you disregard the interpretations  the facts open  up a can of worms   why the urgency on the part of trusted noynoy henchman puno  did he know something about the plane at that moment that we all did not know  if something was so important   why was it not in a government office instead of a private home  why did noynoy not stick up for puno  the most important question of all  if your husband s home was immediately violated at an extremely vulnerable time would you trust the person who did the violating  would you trust the person the boss that person was representing   well leni went on to make that person her boss and was totally obedient to him  oxford dictionary defines vice president  an official or executive ranking below and deputizing for a president    in almost six years as vice president   she did not do her job as if she was ranking below  she looked down on the duly elected president  leni as a vice president was not loyal to her president  leni as a presidential candidate was not loyal to her daughter   leni as a wife did not seem traumatized by a fatal plane crash and a break and enter on the same day to ask the same questions i did  her rallies make it a point to exclude the philippine flag  leni as candidate for president in the  elections is not even loyal to her running mate  what makes you think she will be loyal to the citizens of that flag   epilogue we all have been exposed to the campaign tactics by leni fanatics  many of them noynoy fans who never saw him as the emperor with no clothes  let s go door to door  let s belittle those that think differently and let s disqualify the front runner  making leni out to be saint or in the image of the virgin mart or whatever  fabricating sex scandals for the sake of slandering those they envy  i normally will not watch the netflix show bridgerton but i found myself paying attention to  and a quote hit me on the head like a large frying pan being held by mike tyson that screamed leni campaign   attempting to influence others as to the correct course of action  well  it is often a trying and irritating endeavor that only brings out the worst in us before we discover it has been fruitless all along   it just crystalized my thoughts so eloquently on the campaign of the yellows who are now pink ,1
1539,on twitter  kapamilya actress liza soberano allegedly retweeted the tweet of a certain  unvrslcnsprcy who urged pinoys to let that sink in robin padilla garnered more votes than leni robredo in the  polls and the op called this phenomenon a f cking joke  in that regard  the luminous can t help but react to liza soberano s retweet  basically  atty  trixie s response to liza soberano s retweet revolves around enlightening the filipina  american actress how philippine election works and even in many parts of the globe  for example  the candidate who garners the most number of votes wins  and to get the votes  each candidate is given the chance to convince as many voters as he she can in the campaign period  otherwise  the most number of voters will go to the other candidate  after the ballots are counted  the winners are declared  and the loser  ideally concedes  accepts the winner  no matter how funny or ridiculous that sounds to her  and finally  atty  trixie pointed out to liza soberano that having condescending attitude based on the choice of candidate doesn t make her the darling to the majority who did not vote for her choice  that kind of attitude did not make her convincing as an endorser  you may now read atty  trixie s original fb post below  but that is how elections work  ms  soberano  the one with the most number of votes wins  the campaign period is when you try to convince the voters to go for your candidate  and if you failed to convince them  then the most number of votes don t go to your candidate  after that you accept the winner  no matter how funny or ridiculous that sounds to you  and by the way  looking down on our choice of candidate doesn t exactly endear you to the majority who voted against your choice  kaya hindi kayo convincing eh  the caveat is  we don t know if indeed this is liza soberano s legit twitter account if the actress even own one in the absence of the blue check beside the twitter profile name  signifying its legitimacy  or perhaps  she was just too busy to even bother to do the steps to receive the blue check  ,1

1552,totoo po na may naipanalong kaso ang pcgg  tama po kayo diyan   totoo rin po na mali iyong title ng nasa vlog na iyan na walang naipanalo na kaso  ang aming wishlist lang ay  sana you would be fair enough to educate your readers that while it is true na may naipanalo ang pcgg against the marcoses  these are civil cases of forfeiture from summary judgement  not a full trial   walang final criminal judgement of pagnanakaw sa kaban ng bayan  did you know  in gr   respondents  heirs of fem  argued that this case should be a criminal procedure  so that they will be given a full blown trial  sila  marcoses  na mismo ang nagsasabi na criminal ang kaso nila  para mabigyan sila ng chance to explain themselves  context  in a full blown trial   kung may tinatago ka  dapat takot kang masampahan ng criminal case  di ba  but the marcoses  sila mismo ang nag argue na dapat criminal procedure  yes  sabi ng respondents  dapat kasuhan sila ng kriminal  pero hindi ginaw ng pcgg  dahil ba wala naman talaga silang mapatunayang nakaw criminally  pcgg  bakit ayaw niyong gawing kriminal ang mga marcoses sa mata ng korte at batas  bakit hindi pagnanakaw ang ikaso  bakit summary judgement  no full trial  for forfeiture ng assets  baka silent pro marcos kayo ha  unfortunately  the sc said  corona   dapat summary trial  hindi full trial   kasi kapag summary trial  mas mapapadaling makuha ng pcgg ang mga assets  gets  kahit ganun ang decision ni cj corona  hindi pa rin nagtanim ng galit si bbm sa kanya  bbm was one of those who stood with cj corona noong pag initan siya under the admin of noynoy aquino  alam niyo ba bakit pinag initan si corona  he ruled in favor of the farmers sa hacienda luisita  bbm supported corona for the justice of the farmers  kahit hindi favorable ang ruling ni corona sa mga marcoses  also  the  counts of graft of imelda is also not final  it s currently under the supreme court  lagi itong sinasabi ng mga uninformed sa kalakaran ng judicial process  at nagpapanggap na well informed  hindi nila alam ang concept ng hierarchy of courts  petition for certiorari  presumption of innocence  at right to bail  ang daming nagmamagaling at sinasabing   nakalaya si imelda dahil pinalaya ni digong   sinungaling iyan  the president cannot pardon someone whose case is not yet final  kapag ginawa iyan ni digong  magkakaroon ng constitutional crisis  nakalaya si imelda dahil sa presumption of innocence at dahil sa rule of law  due process and rule or law are parts of human rights na pinaglalaban ng makakaliwang grupo  pero kapag sa mga marcoses nag apply ito  bawal na   di ba iyan ang pinaglalaban ng mga human rights advocates  the duality  the hypocrisy  nakalaya siya because her case is bailable  because of due process  because of rule of law  hindi dahil matanda na siya  stop these lies  si de lima  naka detain siya because her case is a about illegal drugs  and the presumption of guilt in her case is strong  korte po ang nag dedecide kung bailable or  not under rules of court  hindi si digong  hindi si bbm  may separation of powers po   this is the reason bakit malaya si imelda  presumption of innocence  at bakit naka detain si de lima  non bailable case  presumption of guilt is strong   may naipanalo nga ang pcgg na case  but these cases do not talk about pagnanakaw sa kaban ng bayan  see my examples above   pcgg failed to convict them with a criminal case  which requires a quantum of evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt  so   your fact check  sounds right   but incomplete  may ommissions   di ba  kayo ang mahilig mag fact check ng  kulang sa konteksto   di ba  iyong fact check niyo  kulang din sa konteksto  buti na lang busy ako ngayon  at wala ako masyadong time para isa isahin iyan  hindi ko sinasabing walang ninakaw ang mga marcos ha  who am i to say that  korte po ang magsasabi niyan  hindi mga media  hindi tayo  even the courts don t say that  ako pa kaya na ordinaryong tao lang  ang issue kasi rito  iyong mga kasong iyan does not discuss pagnanakaw sa kaban ng bayan  summary judgement pa  ako  i am also looking for criminal convictions of pagnanakaw  also stop using the argument na walang plunder law noong panahon ni fem  kaya hindi na convict kasi hindi retroactive while it s true na hindi retroactive  nabasa niyo na ba ang plunder law  mismong plunder law ang nagsasabi na hindi niya sakop ang mga kaso arising from  ni cory  so your argument is already debunked  to put the nail to the coffin  may ra  rin since   pero di niyo pa rin na convict criminally  another argument is   patay na si fem  hindi na ma convict   eh di sinungaling ka  anong ginawa ni cory noong siya ang presidente at buhay pa si fem  gumawa nga siya ng  di ba using executive  legislative  and judicial powers in one  in short  diktador  she was the president  proclaimed  with the effect of a law  and became the  judge  by saying that assets of the marcoses are  ill gotten  kahit wala pang court trial  if cory could afford to become a true dictator  bakit hindi niya na convict si fem noong buhay siya  walang enough na evidence  in fact  nanalo nga sila sa new york    cases walang criminal conviction  ang ginawa ninyo  fishing expedition  taking advantage of  which was clearly a violation of the equal protection clause of the  constitution na mismong si cory ang pasimuno  alam ko you will also raise iyong saln ni fem na sobra sobra ang kayamanan compared sa sahod  etc  yes  alam ko po iyan  i can also debunk that using common sense based on extrajudicial admissions ni imelda na ayaw habulin ng pcgg  bakit kaya  bakit  billion lang pcgg  bakit hindi   kasi nga  masisira ang narrative niyo  kasi walang ganyang pera ang pinas  when imelda confessed the gargatuan amount  deadma naman kayo  bakit kaya  masisira ang consistency ng narrative   billion nga until now hindi niyo mapatunayang ninakaw eh  puro kaso seizure at forfeiture  tapos ginawan ng computation para abutin ang  billion  pero pag aari ba talaga ng mga marcos ang iba diyan  iyong iba nga diyan nabuking kayo  donation pala  mismong donors ang nag callout sa inyo  tapos you added its price sa inventory para ma inflate ang sinasabi niyong ill gotten wealth  kahit na donation pala   ilang bilyon na ba ang naging pondo niyo pcgg  you hired the best lawyers  yet you failed to criminally convict them in  years  sadly  mga pcgg chairs ang na convict na korakot  how ironic  si former pcgg chair bautista naman  nagtatago sa ibang bansa  habang ayaw niyang harapin ang bilyong bilyong kayamanan niya na allegedly galing sa kaban ng bayan na nadiskubre at isinumbong ng mismo niyang asawa  in the meantime  ito lang muna  the marcos wealth issue is complex  i cannot discuss everything here  may mga areas din na pinapag aralan ko pa  marcos critics will raise different arguments for sure  alam ko na iyan  diverting this case at hand  napag aralan ko na rin karamihan ng mga  copy paste  argument nila galing kay sereno  but when you engage in discussion asking them ano ang content ng mga links nila and when you ask them to discuss specific topics sa mga links na binibigay nila  hindi naman pala nila nabasa  kung nabasa man nila  hindi rin naman nila maintindihan  kaya personal attacks na lang ang gagawin ,1

1608,the recent conviction of police officers charged with planting evidence and torturing drug suspects supports the argument that the government does not condone impunity  policemen jeffrey perez and ricky arquilita denied the charges and may even face murder raps in the future  but for now  a court found them guilty and sentenced mr  perez to a minimum of  years  imprisonment  mr  arquilita died before the trial concluded  amnesty international downplayed the conviction as a  drop in the bucket   given the thousands who died during war on drugs waged by then president rodrigo duterte  that seems unfair  at least   did die during the campaign  according to official figures  but that number pales in comparison with the millions who voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and underwent treatment during the previous government s tenure  the recent conviction may be rare but may be more are coming  human rights watch  citing the department of justice  reported that the government was investigating  cases involving  policemen implicated in questionable killings  that seems hard to reconcile with allegations that the state policy had been to condone or even encourage murdering suspected drug offenders  granted  mr  duterte did threaten to kill drug pushers  but in his defense  his allies claim that outrageous soundbites were merely political theater  he simply wanted to get a message through an audience that was not going be moved by  pretty please  or similar polite appeals to stop using and peddling illegal drugs  despite mr  duterte s controversial approach  the government followed the law as best it could  the dangerous drugs board or ddb      reiterates that no policies have been issued that permit  tolerate and condone killings and other human rights violations in relation to the philippine s anti drug campaign   police rights besides  law enforcers have the right to protect themselves  the commission on human rights released a report earlier this year  saying  victims of the drug war were in law enforcement  that number included  active duty members of the philippine national police  indeed  those who died in the line of duty deserve the same public sympathy from human rights advocates and others who have been relentless in criticizing the past administration s drug war  some refuse or deny to appreciate that when mr  duterte was elected president  some  percent of villages were infiltrated by drug syndicates  he may have failed to eradicate the drug problem  as he had promised  but before leaving office  only   percent of the villages were yet to be cleared of illegal drugs operations  the ddb reported that   percent of filipinos between ages  and  still use illegal substances  and from the start of the duterte administration to early this year  the philippine drug enforcement agency has seized   billion worth of narcotics  drug abuse is far from the harmless or recreational habit that some may imagine  to paraphrase mr  duterte  illegal drugs ruin lives and even exacts an economic toll  particularly on lost labor productivity  that may be because among filipino substance abusers  the leading drug used is  shabu  or methamphetamine hydrochloride  there should be more indignation and public outcry against those pushing illegal drugs  also  there should be more attention given to the lives and families ruined by illegal substances  regrettably  most human rights advocates and critics of the campaign against illegal drugs seem only interested in blaming the government  the drug syndicates  including their pushers  are not harmless  and the harsh reality is that there are crooked policemen and corrupt politicians who are helping or enabling the illegal drug trade  that makes the job even harder for law enforcers  the majority of whom are honest and committed to serving and protecting the people  until today  the illicit drug trade is thriving  at least based on the large busts reported in the news  the marcos government has vowed to continue the campaign against illegal drugs  although president ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  said that he wanted to target the syndicate bosses  we hope the government succeeds  but the recent conviction of the police officers is a reminder of how tough and complex the challenge will be   ,0

1644,manila bulletin writer krizette chu and her fb followers are making a lot of noise on facebook with a petition to pbbm asking to recall or replace the national security adviser prof  clarita carlos because they have no confidence of her leadership to lead the ntf elcac which prrd and his men have worked hard in the last few years with the sole mission   stamp out the npa rebels and its legal fronts in philippine society  of course  marcos loyalists are asking chu and the dds who shares her sentiment to give nsa secretary carlos the chance to prove her mettle before asking her head on the platter  besides  at the time chu was making a lot of noise on her fb page  nsa secretary has yet to sit down with the afp for her security briefings until yesterday noon  so it s really premature to judge her based on her past pronouncements that made chu and company to ask for prof  carlos replacement when she has yet to get all the information she needs to help her decide what to do with ntf elcac and the duterte appointees  based on her latest interview  she has nothing to do with the firing of people as alleged by ms  chu in her latest fb post because those co terminus with the president are also expected to go unless they are retained by their agency heads by making a request  here s the link of the interview of sec  clarita carlos wherein she talked about sitting down with members of the ntf elcac and getting briefed  just jump straight to around    if you don t want to watch the   hour plus interview  the briefing of sec  carlos with afp and ntf elcac happened around noon on july     in the midst of the brouhaha over the nsa secretary carlos  atty  bruce rivera wrote a timely article with the title  reconciling prof clarita carlos and dr  lorraine badoy positions in an attempt to enlighten the supporters of both camps and that there is nothing to fight about because both women come from the same school of skinning a c t  you may now read atty  bruce original fb post below and let us hear what you think by posting your comments on the page  i watched and listened to both arguments and in all honesty  i really do not see the conflict in both positions  dr  badoy is talking a practical standpoint  indeed  there is recruitment in schools by the forces of the cpp npa  but prof carlos is also correct in saying that no policy supporting it will ever exist in all our schools as a matter of principle  here is the cause of confusion  democracy  we are against the cpp npa because they threaten our democratic institutions  and for good reason  but it is also our adherence to democratic precepts of free speech and expression and the right to education that enables recruitment by the cpp npa because they can only shape minds if they are in a society that allows freedom of ideas  that is what i think prof clarita carlos is getting her bearings  dr  lorraine marie t  badoy and the ntf elcac argues that the cpp npa is allowed to fester in schools and that is very true  which needs to be remedied by the state and government  but from a security standpoint  we cannot prevent the flow of ideology by preventing it to flow  because at some point  it is like a dam waiting to burst its banks when heavy rains are here  if we curtail ideology by preventing it to flow  will just encourage the morbid curiosity of free thinkers who thrives best in an environment they are not allowed to think  so  my position is clear  badoy and carlos come from the same school of killing the cat  but there are so many ways of punishing your pussy and killing a destructive cat  ,1

1647,the creation of a select oversight committee on confidential and intelligence expenses will help ensure that agencies who are given confidential and intelligence funds  cifs  would be able to use this specific appropriation for the purpose it was intended for  senate committee on finance chief sen  sonny angara said on sunday  november   angara pointed this out as he vouched that the  million and  million cifs that the senate approved for the office of the vice president  ovp  and the department of education  deped  both of which are headed by vice president sara duterte carpio would be utilized properly and wisely  senate minority leader aquilino  koko  pimentel iii and fellow minority senator risa hontiveros have both vowed to push for the realignment of the funds under the vice president during the period of amendments on the proposed   trillion national budget for  scheduled this week   meron talagang paraan para talagang bantayan yan  at iyan ay tinutukan din ng ating senate president juan miguel zubiri nung mag file po siya ng resolusyon na buhayin po itong select oversight committee on confidential and intelligence expenses  there is really a mechanism on how to really look after that  and that was also pointed out by our senate president juan miguel zubiri when he filed a resolution to revive the select oversight committee on confidential and intelligence expenses    angara said in a radio dzbb interview  last week  the senate president filed the resolution to form an oversight panel that will investigate the utilization of cifs allocated under the proposed  national budget after several former senators pushed for its activation  the senate finance panel head noted it was an advice of the former senate president vicente  tito  sotto iii and former sen  panfilo  ping  lacson  who also once chaired the committee   ipinaalala nila na merong ganyang komite dati na hindi lang basta basta pinapalusot lahat ng gastos ng mga ahensya sa confidential at intelligence expenses   they reminded that there used to be a similar committee that did not just slip all the expenses of the agencies into confidential and intelligence expenses    angara pointed out   at yan  kailangan ilabas nila kung talagang nararapat sa national security para sa darating na mga taon  ma evaluate o mabantayan din yan ng kongreso pagdating dito sa budget  and that  they need to release if it is really appropriate for national security for the coming years  congress can also evaluate or monitor that when it comes to the budget    he said  angara  nevertheless  said there is a possibility that the cifs under the deped and the ovp could be slashed and or channeled to other agencies  but on a personal note  the senator said he hopes that the cifs allocated for the vice president would be maintained to enable duterte carpio s office to function well  as what president ferdinand  bongbong  marcos jr  would want to happen  pag aaralan po namin yan  pero sa akin nga  parang hindi maganda na halal po ng tao yan at binigyan po ng pangulo sa ilalim ng kanyang kauna unahang budget  ipinagkatiwala kay vp sara duterte po yan  tapos tatanggalan po natin ng pondo   parang hindi yata  we will study that  but to me  it doesn t seem good that people chose it and the president gave it to her under his first budget  that was entrusted to vp sara duterte  then we will remove the funds   i don t think so     kung ako po ang tatanungin nang personal  huwag naman po natin ilabas yun sa kanyang opisina  sapagkat yun ay gusto ng taumbayan  gusto ng pangulo na magtagumpay po ang ating bise presidente dahil siya ay isang mahalagang bahagi ng kanyang administrasyon  kaya nga  ipinagkatiwala sa kanya yung one of the biggest department sa ating pamahalaan at dyan nakasalalay po yung kinabukasan ng ating mga kabataan  if you ask me personally  let s not bring it out fro her office  because that s what the people want  the president wants that our vice president succeed because she is an important part of his administration  that s why  she was entrusted with one of the biggest departments in our government and the future of our youth depends on that    angara stressed   yun ang personal na pasya ko lang po  pero puwedeng mag iba po yan dahil alam nyo naman ang senado ay isang collegial body  at kung merong mga contentious issues or mga kontrobersyal  puwedeng maiba yan dahil pagbobotohan yan at kung minsan may kompromiso  ganun talaga ang proseso sa isang collegial body  ibig sabihin  hindi iisang tao ang nagdedesisyon kundi yung sinasabing collegial ay yung kolektiba ang nagpapasya  that s just my personal decision  but that can change because you know the senate is a collegial body  and if there are contentious issues or controversial ones  it can be different because it will be voted upon by the members and sometimes there will be a compromise  that is exactly the process in a collegial body  that means  it is not a single person who makes the decision  but what is said to be collegial is the collective decision    he explained  angara earlier said the senate is aiming to approve the  national budget by end of november so the president can sign the general appropriations bill  gab  before christmas  president marcos has certified the  budget bill as urgent  citing the need for continuous government operations amid the covid  pandemic and the need to support programs for full economic recovery   ,0

1652,president marcos on tuesday said the philippine government would be sending a note verbale to china regarding the incident near pag asa island where chinese coast guard personnel reportedly retrieved forcibly a piece of rocket debris that the philippine navy had recovered last sunday   yes  i think that that s what we need to do   the president replied when asked about national security adviser clarita carlos  recommendation to send the diplomatic note regarding the latest west philippine sea incident  mr  marcos briefly spoke to reporters after addressing the  founding anniversary celebrations of the career executive service board at the philippine international convention center  he recounted that after armed forces of the philippines chief lt  gen  bartolome bacarro reported the sunday incident to him  he asked bacarro to immediately call the military attaché at the chinese embassy to get a report   the report of the philippine navy and the report from china did not match because the word  forcibly  was used in the philippine navy report  and that was not the characterization in the chinese navy report or the report coming from china   the president said   so we have to resolve this issue  of course  i have complete trust in our navy and if this is what they say happened  i can only believe that that is what happened   he added  the president said chinese officials would be asked to shed more light on their contradictory version of the incident   so we have to now ask the chinese  why is it that their account is so different and it s much more benign shall we use that word because the word  forcibly  was used  at least in the initial reports of the philippine navy   he said  avoiding miscalculations mr  marcos said he would also raise the incident to chinese president xi jinping when he visits beijing next year   so we ll find a way to resolve this  this is one of the things  these kinds of incident are some of the things that   i m glad that i am going to beijing early january because these are the things that we need to work out   he said  the president also said he wanted miscalculations avoided as he aired his desire to keep tensions from getting out of hand through mutually agreed mechanisms   because with the way that the region  our region   asia pacific  is heating up  someone might commit an error  if there s a mistake  there s a misunderstanding  then the fire might get worse   he said   so we don t want that to happen  so we want to have a mechanism  we have to find a way for this not to happen again   that we won t have incidents like this anymore   he added  carlos  who is concurrent chair of the national task force for the west philippine sea  ntf wps   disclosed her recommendation to send a diplomatic note in an interview over radio station dzbb on tuesday  she noted  however  the philippines used to send notes verbales in the past when such incidents happened   we ll say that  xi jinping and president bongbong  have just spoken in  and there they said they will really focus on constructive engagement and critical dialogue  and now this happened again   carlos said  dialogue she said the chinese leadership under xi should be put to task for failing what they had committed to do   this happened again  this keeps on happening  so what is that all about  what s the sense of what their leadership  xi jinping had said  is that empty   she asked  carlos  however  said manila remained open to the peaceful resolution of its conflicting maritime claims with china in the west philippine sea   we are not at war with this country  china  so let s continue to dialogue  we wish china also understands where our supreme national interest lies  our supreme national interest is protecting our territory  and protecting the filipino people  in our seas   she said  the tense confrontation at sea took place just three days after the bilateral meeting between mr  marcos and xi  the china coast guard twice blocked a philippine naval boat towing the suspected rocket debris and deployed an inflatable boat with some of its personnel on board to cut the towing line between the debris and naval boat  the filipino sailors returned to the island without the debris  china coast guard ships have in the past blocked philippine boats on resupply missions to soldiers stationed in its detachments in the west philippine sea  but sunday s incident was the first time that it seized an object in the possession of the philippine military  the chinese embassy has denied the philippine military s account and said it was  inconsistent with facts    before the china coast guard found the said floating object some philippine navy personnel already retrieved and towed it  after friendly consultation  the philippine side returned the floating object to the chinese side on the spot   it claimed  it added   the chinese side expressed gratitude to the philippine side  there was no so called blocking of the course of a philippine navy boat and forcefully retrieving the object at the scene   a series of blasts were also heard by pag asa island residents after the maritime encounter  which they said were strong enough to jolt the ground  pag asa s police said  the repetitive sounds  believed  from artillery guns weapons  from chinese held zamora  subi  reef about  kilometers away one of seven man made islands built by beijing in the disputed spratlys  ,0

1656,president ferdinand marcos jr  on monday said the philippines would not rejoin the international criminal court  icc   noting that the government was already investigating alleged crimes in the previous administration s bloody campaign against illegal drugs   no  the philippines has no intention of rejoining the icc   the president said in a brief interview with reporters on the sidelines of his visit to the pasig city sports complex vaccination site     we re saying that there is already an investigation going on here and it s continuing  so why would there be one like that    he pointed out  he said the government was already crafting the proper response to the tribunal s invitation to submit  observations  as the hague based court seeks to resume its investigation of alleged abuses during the duterte administration s crackdown on illegal drugs  in an order dated july   the icc said the country has until sept      to provide any observations on the icc prosecutor s request to reopen its probe  marcos confirmed the meeting he had on july  with foreign secretary enrique manalo  solicitor general menardo guevarra  justice secretary jesus crispin remulla  chief presidential legal counsel juan ponce enrile and private lawyer harry roque to begin discussing the administration s strategy in dealing with the icc  the president said roque was consulted because  he is involved and recognized by the icc   an expert in public international law and human rights  roque is among the lawyers   the only filipino   accredited to practice before the icc   so anyway   so we will know what we will do  if we will respond  if we will not respond  and if we will respond  what will our response be  or it s also possible that we will ignore them because we are not under them anymore   he said  the president said the icc was  a very different kind of a court  so the government s legal team would  study  the correct response to the icc probe resumption   i told them to study well the procedure so that we ll be able to do the correct thing  because we do not want  of course  that they might misinterpret our actions  that s why we should be clear about what we have to do  who will write who  what will be in the letter  among others    he said  last january  then presidential aspirant marcos said he would not allow icc prosecutors to come and investigate accusations of crimes against humanity     we have a functioning judiciary  and that s why i don t see the need for a foreigner to come and do the job for us  our judicial system is perfectly capable of doing that   he said then  regrettable decision the philippines  a state party to the rome statute since nov      formally notified the body of its withdrawal from the statute on march     the withdrawal took effect only a year after  or on march     however  the icc retained jurisdiction with respect to alleged crimes that occurred in the philippines while it was a state party  or from nov      to march     in march   then president rodrigo duterte ordered the withdrawal of the country s ratification of the rome statute  the treaty which created the icc  just weeks after former icc chief prosecutor fatou bensouda announced a preliminary examination was underway into the deaths of thousands due to his administration s illegal drugs crackdown  opposition leaders earlier asked marcos to rejoin the icc to boost safeguards against human rights abuses  on monday  sen  risa hontiveros said marcos  decision for the philippines to stay out of the icc was  regrettable   insisting that those being investigated by the international body should not be afraid if they  have nothing to hide    it is the prerogative of the president  though it is regrettable as the rome statute is the collective commitment of the community of nations against state sponsored impunity   hontiveros said in a statement   i hope he will not undermine or block  investigation of acts or violations that took place before the philippines withdrew from the icc   she said  senate minority leader aquilino pimentel iii said he did not agree with marcos  move  but he acknowledged that the chief executive was the  decision maker on if and or when to join an international organization or treaty   probe resumption lawyers representing the drug war victims said they remained undaunted by the president s decision not to rejoin the icc  expressing confidence that the probe would still continue   edre olalia  president of the national union of peoples  lawyers  said marcos  decision  would not fatally affect the resumption of the investigation even as it would not be a walk in the park    the icc has the means  experience  resources and creativity to deal with situations such as noncooperation by states   olalia said  experts in international law and even the icc itself believed that withdrawal from the statute would not affect ongoing proceedings  including the current investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity committed during duterte s six year war on drugs  this follows article  of the rome statute  which states that criminal investigations and proceedings that started before withdrawals took effect will continue  the icc s chief prosecutor  karim khan  recently asked the court to reopen a probe into the drug war  which was deferred last year upon the request of the philippine government  after finding that the country did not conduct any genuine investigation into the crimes being investigated by the high tribunal  lawyer kristina conti  co counsel for the victims  called marcos  decision  a terrible mistake  and could prove to be a costly miscalculation not to rejoin the icc    should  choose not to cooperate with the international court s investigation supported and called for by many filipinos  he will contend with a political storm with international impact   she added   ,0

1717,it was supposed to be a night of praise and tribute for nobel laureate maria ressa  with no less than hollywood celebrity meryl streep introducing her during the award ceremonies sponsored by the clooney foundation  but alas  the night turned from magical to embarrassing for the ceo of philippine blogsite rappler  during her introduction  streep said that ressa could stay in the u s  and seek asylum to avoid the conviction and court cases she is facing in the philippines  reacting to streep s statement  ressa said she felt insulted when the actress insinuated she was not an american citizen   ressa has dual citizenship   american and filipino    streep displayed the arrogance of many americans who stereotype people of color  read  non whites  as perpetual foreigners and invaders of the great white way   ressa told the adobo chronicles  we tried to reach streep for comment on ressa s accusation but were told by her secretary that she was busy filming her  movie of her lifetime  the adobo chronicles publisher rene astudillo came to the rescue of ressa by saying that streep should brush up on u s  immigration law   ,1
1718,  leni robredo came to evacuation centres evidently prepared with props for her photo and video ops   there s something about current  vice president  leni robredo that quite simply irks a lot of netizens  her recent activities distributing relief goods and serving lugaw  congee  and pandesal to evacuees fleeing the aftermath of the taal volcano eruption should  to be fair  not really be a source of annoyance  unfortunately for robredo  netizens do get annoyed with these lame displays  it is likely because of the silly smile permanently pasted on robredo s face that undermines this otherwise sensible pr stunt  indeed  rather than highlight the plight of the eruption victims  robredo s character is what attracts all the attention whether it be adulation or detraction  regardless of one s partisan affiliation  one cannot argue that stunts like these make it all about leni robredo and not about the the ordinary people caught up in this crisis  one could also blame the media who clamber over one another to get a piece of robredo s exhibits and sound bytes and leave very little air time to tell the stories of real people  it s a clear case of celebrity obsession made perverse by the contextual situation  worse  the praise being lavished upon robredo by her supporters makes it look like serving lugaw and pandesal to people is the pinnacle of political achievement  they think her actions are signs that she is a true  leader   robredo is basically a person with a job title but with no job description attached to it  she s just filling time  robredo s got too much time on her hands  these sorts of activities would normally be delegated to staff or volunteers by executives with real jobs  and even so  the focus of any documentary would have been on the evacuees and not on the politicians  we all know she s just doing it for the cameras  robredo is simply running on empty  after being fired twice for incompetence  she realised there is nothing more to lose  her dignity is gone too and that is why she stoops to such lows ,1
1719,go negosyo founder joey concepcion on sunday said the fourth quarter of  will be crucial for the economy as consumer spending is expected to pick up  urging that mobility be maintained to ensure that the country s economic recovery does not stall  concepcion said the last three months of the year  which will coincide with the christmas season  will be particularly important for micro  small and medium enterprises  msmes  and to the philippine economy in general     we need people going out  if people don t spend  this will affect our economy  how will we attain the growth target that is needed to maintain our credit rating  the last quarter  beginning this october  is crucial for our msmes   concepcion said in a statement  concepcion said that a number of external factors  which threaten to weaken consumer spending were beyond the government s control  implying that other measures have to be implemented to temper the effects   we cannot control the rising prices and rising interest rates  external factors like the conflict in russia and ukraine are now affecting all of us   concepcion said   what we can control is our own willingness to keep businesses active   he added  some industries have recently expressed hope that the christmas season will have a substantial effect on consumer spending  accelerating their recovery from the pandemic  for instance  the local car industry said they expect vehicle sales to pick up toward the end of the year as buyers were generally more willing to spend for high ticket items during this time   normally december or  the end of the year  sales are picking up  we hope that this would continue   lawyer rommel gutierrez  president of the chamber of automotive manufacturers of the philippines inc   told reporters a few days ago  george barcelon  president of philippine chamber of commerce and industry  also expressed the same optimism that consumer spending during the yuletide season will rise  helping local businesses that are still reeling from the effects of the pandemic   it generally gets better during this time  i think the challenge now is really how to contain    barcelon told the inquirer earlier this month when sought for comment on prospects toward the end of the year  concepcion highlighted the importance of continued vigilance against covid   saying caution is particularly important now as schools have returned to holding in person classes as well as the easing of the face mask rules outdoors  ,0

1721,  we can t even expect a statement from the faculty of the ateneo de manila university   bautista s alma mater and liberal party ally   to comment on his predicament since condemning his alleged corrupt activities will also reflect badly on the school   from the moment patricia bautista held a press conference exposing her husband   commission on elections  comelec  chairman andres bautista s  unexplained hidden wealth  a week ago  the public has been transfixed by the development of the issue  most people have been left guessing and speculating on which one of the two is telling the truth   however  the silence from certain sectors in philippine society particularly the liberal party  its allies and supporters is deafening  even a so called  investigative journalists  don t seem to have enough motivation to investigate the source of bautista s wealth  their behaviour is hardly surprising though  their  no comment  stance just confirms what some have suspected all along  a lot of people have long speculated that the supposed non partisan comelec chairman bautista is allied with the liberal party  now that he is under scrutiny for alleged corruption  his liberal party mates are most likely feeling the heat as well  indeed  this scandal is bigger than andres bautista and his wife patricia  this could spell disaster for the liberal party  if prosecuted for illegally amassing wealth  prosecutors could uncover evidence of electoral fraud favouring the liberal party candidates in the    or even earlier   elections  allegations of vote rigging was rife even during the  presidential elections  there are people who insist that former president bs aquino s win was the result of vote rigging too  patricia bautista s message to the public is clear  when asked if she is aware of the implication of what she is doing  she replied that if people turn a blind eye to this revelation  everything they complain about like the horrendous traffic  instability of the economy  and unemployment among other ills that plague the country will mean nothing  after all  the people essentially lose their right to complain when  after their public servants neglect their duties yet again  they go on to elect the same public servants again and again  this is assuming that every election is clean  if there is evidence that the election was rigged to favour candidates the voters did not choose themselves  then the public should be outraged  but if they choose to shrug it off and pretend that vote rigging is okay  then they are throwing away their right to suffrage  since that is the case  the philippines is no longer a democracy  it is being run by the mafia   those who manipulate the result of elections  it may even be possible that they sell the votes to the highest bidder with the help of electronic voting machine provider smartmatic and comelec  i ve always said that the problem in the philippines has less to do with the tyranny of the few  but more to do with the tyranny of the majority   those who give power to the few members of the elite  that statement is evident again with the behaviour of filipinos who pretend that vote rigging did not happen in the previous elections even when blatant tampering was done in the middle of canvassing of votes in the  presidential elections  some people are in denial because they don t want to burst their own bubble  they hold on to the belief that the liberal party is for the interests of the people because that has been the narrative the party s allies in mainstream media have been telling us for more than  years  these people s apathy and arrogance make them enemies of the state  i don t know how some people can continue deluding themselves even when bautista is already starting to show signs of inconsistencies  we can t even expect a statement from the faculty of the ateneo de manila university   bautista s alma mater and liberal party ally   to comment on his predicament since condemning his alleged corrupt activities will also reflect badly on the school  they will avoid putting their own in a bad light since it will highlight the fact that the school produces a lot of crooks  initially  bautista said that his wife fabricated documents  but then he admits to owning several bank accounts in his subsequent statements in separate interviews with the media    people know this  that there were investments made by my family with forex  this is a problem now  i don t know if you ve heard of this  but it was like pyramid scheme   he said  he added the bautista family would answer the unexplained wealth allegations  in due time   it is true that our family and myself have deposits with luzon development bank  as to the amount  i m not sure because i said  these bankbooks were stolen   bautista told anc s headstart  though the comelec chief does not know if there were actually  passbooks  he explained that he had several passbooks because of the investments he had with his siblings and parents   we had to demarcate who owns which    bautista s inconsistencies are very telling  it s a sign that he could be lying  he is starting to falter  he doesn t behave like a seasoned lawyer  why would he even admit that he and his family were into pyramid schemes  he should know that pyramid schemes are illegal in the philippines  he is behaving more like a suspect under duress  he probably feels like everything is blowing up in his face  he is certainly coming across like a loser since he did not take care of his wife and failed to pacify her when he had the chance  the source of bautista s wealth is one thing   he may or may not be able to prove they are sourced legally  but it still doesn t explain why he did not include them in his statement of assets liability and net worth  saln    if a former supreme court chief justice was impeached for less than what bautista has in his bank accounts  then bautista deserves a similar fate or  perhaps even more fitting  jail time ,1

ng mga stocks  minamarapat ng mga negosyante na bumili na ngayon  para pag tumaas ang presyo kalaunan  kikita sila  minamarapat din ng mga negosyante na hindi ilagay ang lahat ng perang ikakalakal nila sa iisang  stock  o  share  lamang  kapag kasi ang isang korporasyon ay nalugi nang tuluyan at nagsara  mawawalan na ng saysay ang  stocks  o  shares  nito  babagsak ang presyo  wala ng bibili  parang nagtapon lang ng pera  para maiwasan ito  ikinakalat ng mga negosyante ang kanilang perang ikakalakal sa iba t ibang uri ng  stocks  o  shares   at hinahaluan pa ng mga kautangan  gaya ng

samakatuwid  yung ikinakalat na nagdurugo raw ang ating ekonomiya at nagsislayasan na ang mga namumuhunan ay isang malaking kasinungalingan  wala itong basehan at kung meron man  napakababaw ang pag

namumuhunan  ano ito  parang nagbenta lang ng aliw pero walang parokyano  kaya pak ap na ang mga magpapapak  pangalawa  hindi lamang ang psei ang bumaba  kung susuriin muli ang mga  index  ng iba pang merkado  nagbabaan din  bunga ito hindi lamang  ng kaguluhang nagaganap sa rusya at ukraine  kundi maging ang antas ng interes sa tsina  ang mga bansang ito ay nagdudulot ng banta sa ekonomiya ng anemika  kung saan nakasalalay din ang maraming korporasyon dito sa pilipinas  dahil ang kanilang mga inang kumpanya o  mother company  ay nandoon  pangatlo  natural lamang na bumaba ang psei  dahil hindi pa malinaw ang direksyong kalakalan na tatahakin ng bagong administrasyon  ipagpapatuloy ba nito ang mga nasimulan na ni  prrd o babaguhin ito  ano ang mga gagawing prayoridad sa negosyo  ano ang epekto ng mga restriksyon na hindi magugustuhan ng mga namumuhunan o mga pagluwag nito na aakit naman sa mga bagong mamumuhunan  sa ngayon  hindi pa nadedeklara ang pagiging pangulo ni  bbm  kaya

1723,  the yellowtards need to let go of the delusional strategy they currently apply to their campaign where members within their comfy echo chambers assure one another of the righteousness of their  cause      the withdrawal of senator bong go as presidential candidate consolidates the administration bet for leadership of the philippine government over the next six years following the may  national elections  for the first time since   a majority elected philippine president has become a possibility if we are to consider the popularity numbers of leading candidate bongbong marcos  together with his running mate sara duterte  the two collectively account for the lion s share of polled voter preferences over the last  to  months  with president rodrigo duterte running for a senate seat and gloria macapagal arroyo a strong contender for house speakership if she succeeds in her bid for a congressional seat  filipinos may be witness to the rise of the most powerful philippine government yet  the opposition led by the yellowtard  kakampink  camp of  vice president  and presidential candidate leni robredo are already shittin  bricks over the coming together of a  four party alliance  that will back the marcos duterte tandem  the alliance is a formidable and experienced coalition  together  the parties that make it up had collectively catapulted three presidents to power  arroyo  joseph  erap  estrada  and fidel ramos  as if that were not enough to crush the spirits of the yellowtards and their new unfriends  the communists  the administration camp have also managed to attract the support of all  mayors of the province of cebu  the key to marcos s success can be gleaned from what rappler  journalist  lian buan was forced to admit in her piece  marcos woos duterte vote  gets backing of cebu mayors  published the other day where she  reports    a divisive figure because of his father s dictatorial rule marked with human rights violations and corruption  marcos has so far stuck to a message of unification and says he shuns  gutter politics    marcos had remained consistent to this tack even as other candidates   most notably robredo herself   stuck to the tradition of mudslinging and demonisation as a means to prop up their personal brands  marcos exhibited grace even in the face of attack from president rodrigo duterte himself who  at one time  referred to him as a  weak leader  and even hinted that he uses cocaine  robredo  for her part  in mid november had already recognised the fatal effect on her political brand caused by overzealous bird brained partisans  the bigotry in the robredo camp was at such levels that many reported family ties and friendships collapsing over political differences leading robredo to urge her followers to  initiate reconciliation  approach other people  and when you see something untrue or something that does not coincide with our beliefs  explain in a calm and respectful manner     nasaang panig ka man  gaano man kasigurado sa paninindigan mo  may nakasakit ng kapwa  panahon na  tayo na ang magsimula  lumapit sa mga naka alitan  kung may nakita sa social media na hindi naaayon sa mga pinaniniwalaan natin  magpaliwanag nang mahinahon at may respeto   robredo said   politics is  indeed  addition  the yellowtards are learning their lessons too late and instituting too little reforms within their ranks  their embedded culture of martial law crybabyism  fear mongering over the fantasy of a  return to authoritartianism   and a stubborn parroting of elitist concepts like  human rights  and  gender equality  that are irrelevant   even alien   to the average filipino had really done them in  as a result  they have ended up even more disunited now than they were just a few months back when an early attempt at an opposition coalition dubbed    sought to elevate one single unifying opposition candidate to go up against the administration camp  meanwhile  the administration camp has achieved all of that and more   a single presidential candidate and a slate of senate and house candidates that will likely mobilise the backing of both chambers of congress around the coming second marcos administration  what now for the opposition  i wrote just this morning that in the face of imminent defeat  they will need to change their mindset from an aggressive regard for a  winnable  battle to one where mitigation of impending losses is paramount  the yellowtards need to let go of the delusional strategy they currently apply to their campaign where members within their comfy echo chambers assure one another of the righteousness of their  cause   and  therefore  their entitlement to victory  and adopt more of a strategic retreat mindset  it is either that or they lose big in may    i e   not just suffer a catastrophic loss of face and obliterate what remains of their political capital but also drag down with them the fortunes of the oligarchs who continue to foolishly bankroll their  cause  and stake the futures of their family enterprises on a yellowtard return to power  the most powerful government in recent philippine history is coming  people will need to decide amongst themselves which side of the equation they would like to see themselves situated over the foreseeable future  it starts with your own social media accounts  as the eminent communist  activist  katrina stuart santiago observed   after i removed myself from the leni campaign groups  my newsfeed on fb has ceased to be pink  i took only about  days for that algorithm to change  and it s an important thing to consider whenever you think  or imagine  that the numbers on our side are growing  or that there is  public clamor  for anything at all  know that algorithms make us think that  for a reason  ,1

1759,  thanks to the yellowtards  the philippines is currently ruled by two european overlords   one sitting in rome and the other a laughable committee in judges  robes in the hague    proud to be pinoy  is an oft heard phrase when it comes to world champion boxers and beauty pageant contestants  that s because it makes perfect sense that the  winner  coming out of a couple of boys pounding one another silly on a ring or an array of girls strutting around in bikinis on a stage could be a source of national pride  that s on one hand  on the other hand  it also makes perfect sense that pride in one s country needs to also appeal to some higher sensibilities   like an ability to stand on one s own two feet  make one s own decisions  chart one s own destiny  and do all that by being true to one s self  apparently  that source of pride does not resonate with today s philippine opposition  led by the liberal party  a k a   the yellowtards   the opposition prefer that filipinos bow to the rulings of a foreign court when it comes to deciding on the best approach to sorting out their internal affairs  inquirer columnist john nery in his article  duterte to icc  i m beyond accountability  today contributes to the din of shrill cries of  outrage  over the withdrawal of the philippines from the international criminal court  icc   nery refers to this withdrawal as an  unmanly  act on the part of philippine president rodrigo duterte that  only reinforces the impression that he has manipulated the instruments of the government so as never to be held accountable   nery does not cite specifics around how exactly duterte had  manipulated the instruments of the government  to his ends  but he does assert that it creates the  very condition that would invite the icc prosecutor to investigate a sitting head of state   nery says all that as if the icc  by itself  has an intrinsic right to influence   even directly intervene   in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation like the philippines  of course  this is all lost in a corporate media talking head who is part of a political bloc who had  over almost two years  invited his colleagues in western news media to slander his own country and its government on the back of dubious information he and his industry chums fed them  the pattern is quite evident now  the oppostion led by the yellowtards  in their increasing desperation  are laying bare the perverse reliance on western political and cultural power that had long served as pillars of their sick ideology  unfortunately their scramble to regain power had stripped the colour off the ideological morsels thay have been throwing at filipinos revealing  like m ms sucked clean of their yellow sugary coating  the sad little wet nuts at their core  nery  like the western ideological parrot that he is  highlights the rather awkward word   complimentarity  in icc policy jargon to justify the imagined ascendancy with which the icc is encouraged to meddle in philippine domestic affairs   the icc policy paper again   complementarity involves an examination of the existence of relevant national proceedings in relation to the potential cases being considered for investigation by the office  this will be done bearing in mind the office s policy of focusing investigative efforts on those most responsible for the most serious crimes under the court s jurisdiction  where relevant domestic investigations or prosecutions exist  the office will assess their genuineness   nice try  one can easily tell that the icc struggles from a monumental crisis of relevance today  it relies on pieces of  signed  paper and convolutespeak to back the vapourware that is its imagined  mandate  to serve as the beacon of western goodness in a world of diverse politics  the yellowtards  for their part  are using these texts much the way religious clerics use immense volumes of similarly convoluted scripture to prop up their dying cults  indeed  the yellowtards have revealed themselves as no more than a cult   no better than organised religions that rely on a fear of damnation to keep their flock shuffling along the lines drawn for them from ivory towers up those  hills   thanks to the yellowtards  the philippines is currently ruled by two european overlords   one sitting in rome and the other a laughable committee in judges  robes in the hague  does being a european colony well into the second decade of the  century make filipinos proud  duterte  in fact  follows a tradition of asian heroes who sought to free their people from european domination  he has become a reminder that the so called  heroes  put on pedestals by three decades of yellowtard rule under the watch of a roman overlord has done exactly the opposite  bozos like john nery would like to convince filipinos that this is good  that makes people like him liars  it s high time these liars are called out and exhibited not just to filipinos but to all asians for what they are   traitors to hundreds of years of effort to free asia from western european domination ,1

1773,  they re anti china but their brethren in the communist party of the philippines  its terrorist arm the new people s army  and its  legal  national democratic front  cpp npa ndf  have been for the maoist version of communism since    joel pablo salud is one of my  favorite  editors in chief  the other being his mentor inday espina varona  he is very proud of his lack of formal education  yet constantly on the prowl for validation with social media postings of his vast book collection  he asks in his latest philstar piece  what would you ask the presidential candidates if given the chance  salud s fantasized questions are as predictable as he is self deluded   will those who enabled the duterte regime to carry out this inhumanity be charged  what about paid trolls  will they be held accountable for the widespread intimidation and harassment of those critical of this regime  should a law be passed deeming troll farms illegal  what about the bereaved families of ejk victims  will compensation be granted  what of the thousands imprisoned without due process   never mind that there are surveys confirming the trust and approval ratings of the president  in his and his cohort s minds  we are under the spell of dutertismo  an environment of magical realism where we think all is well but is actually not  duterte must ve undergone tutelage from the barangs of siquijor early on in his career as a public official which is why he s never lost an election since he was appointed vice mayor of davao city in   salud mentions a number of issues  all against duterte  not necessarily for the candidates except for the anti terrorism law  of which sen  ping lacson was the principal author of  but what is their beef with the anti terror law  it s simply the power of the anti terrorism council  atc  to arrest without a warrant and detain for  days  a suspect upon the approval of the members of the atc  mind you  all of the kindred spirits of the leftist liberal militants are spared from this proviso  it is nowhere even near as draconian as the british authored internal security at  in force in malaysia and singapore  this is the problem with leftist liberal militants who demand much from the state but want as little intervention as possible  what is contradictory is their stand on the west philippine sea  they re anti china but their brethren in the communist party of the philippines  its terrorist arm the new people s army  and its  legal  national democratic front  cpp npa ndf  have been for the maoist version of communism since   this was a radical shift from the marxist leninist orientation of the original partido komunista ng pilipinas  under luis taruc and the lava brothers  hypocrisy is another outstanding character trait of salud and his ilk  they are against the drug war and accuse the state of masterminding extra judicial killings  ejks  but refuse to hold the npa to account for the murder of civililans  soldiers  and policemen in the insurgency  they claim the country s sovereignty has been subverted by china but gladly open the doors of the country for the international criminal court  icc  to investigate the officials cited in the case filed by the late jude sabio  former sen  antonio trillanes and former rep  gary alejano  there is also the ongoing ideological clash between the pinklawans and the reds over the inclusion of progressives in the pinko senatorial slate and the fact that their hated trapos are guest candidates  they claim they participate in the mainstream to make the people aware of their plight and are fighting for the people and have their support but they haven t won a direct election since they started participating in the same  the most glaring contradiction is martial law human rights violations  their revolution is morally justified in their opinion  which is why the state has no right to defend itself and the citizens from the insurgency which they have been conducting against the state and its citizens  this is why there is the bantayog ng mga bayani which serves as their memorial for the  victims  of martial law  the  election is the chance of the people to vote these morons out of office  they have continually exploited the poor for their cause but haven t done anything to lift them out of poverty  they are the malaise in our society as they corrupt the youth believing that  activism  against the government is justified leading them to leave their families to join the npa in the hinterlands  only to die in encounters with the armed forces of the philippines  afp  later on  it s about time the likes of salud and his cohorts be called to account for the consequences of their actions  we have been looking like fools before the international community for having the longest running insurgency with no end in sight  the onus is not entirely on government as these morons are backed by socialist and communist non government organisations  ngos  in europe which fund them  when will the poor realize that they re being taken for a ride when the leader of the revolution  jose maria sison  lives comfortably in utrecht as a political refugee ,1

1832,president ferdinand marcos jr  has vetoed a bill granting tax exemptions to the honoraria  allowances  and other benefits given to election workers  most of them public school teachers  malacañang announced on saturday  while the intent of the reconciled senate bill no   and house bill no   was laudable  the president said in his veto message to congress on friday that it would be  inequitable to other persons performing similar activities or services     he said the proposed law would counter the objective of the government s comprehensive tax reform program  to correct the inequity in the country s tax system and negate the progressivity of the reforms introduced  by republic act no    or the tax reform for acceleration and inclusion  train  law   moreover  the studies of pertinent government agencies on the revenue loss is too substantial an impact to be foregone   marcos said   vetoes in  month for this year s elections on may   the honoraria and allowances of those who served were to be subjected to a  percent withholding tax  marcos has so far vetoed five bills in his first month in office  four of them he justified by citing either potential revenue losses or unnecessary government expenses  on his first day in office  marcos vetoed the bill creating the bulacan airport city special ecozone  pointing out that granting tax perks to a proposed special economic zone would  significantly narrow our tax base  which was not  aligned with the government s objective to develop a tax system with a broad base and low rates   the president later vetoed the bill on strengthening the office of the government corporate counsel because of  overbearing  provisions  particularly the excessive grant of remuneration  incentives  benefits  and allowances and honoraria  that violates the principles of equity and standardization   no to ptsb as well the proposed measure would have given the government corporate counsel the same salary as that of his boss  the secretary of justice  marcos said  he vetoed the bill on the tax exemptions for election workers along with the bill creating the philippine transportation safety board  ptsb   marcos said that the ptsb s purpose of conducting an impartial and thorough investigation of transportation accidents was already being undertaken by various agencies under the department of transportation  the philippine national police  and the national bureau of investigation    his veto message also on friday said that one of the primary policies and priorities of his administration was to  enhance the government s institutional capacity through optimal and efficient use of resources and strategic rationalization of the functions of government   according to sen  sherwin gatchalian  coauthor of the senate bill  about   department of education  deped  personnel rendered service for this year s national elections    of them as members of electoral boards  ebs   albay rep  joey salceda  one of the principal authors of the house tax relief bill  said the exemption would only cost the government an annualized revenue loss of   million  which was  very reasonable given the job well done   but the president said that providing additional support to any sector was best addressed through  targeted budgetary spending rather than the tax system   the other principal author of the house bill  deputy minority leader and act teachers rep  france castro lambasted the president s veto   slap in face of teacher   the veto of this measure is a slap in the face of every teacher across the country who served the past elections dutifully despite long hours and higher risks of getting covid    castro said in a statement   with the additional risks and longer hours of poll service that they had to endure  removing the  percent tax on their honoraria and allowances is only just   she added  according to the lawmaker  imposing taxes on the honoraria and allowances of poll workers  destroys the spirit and intent  of the election service reform act  or republic act no    to compensate for the hardships of persons rendering election service  in the recent polls  around   police officers also served as special board of election inspectors  sbeis  in cotabato city and some parts of maguindanao after teachers who were supposed to perform the job backed out due to threats to their lives  under comelec resolution no   on nov      teachers who render election related services are entitled to the following honoraria    for eb chairs  and   for eb members  a deped supervisor will get   and the support staff and medical personnel will receive     they also get a travel allowance of    a communication allowance of    an  anti covid  allowance  of   and a minimum service credit of five days  poll workers are also entitled to death benefits amounting to    plus   for medical assistance if they suffer election related injuries or illnesses  police officers serving in sbeis have the same benefits but do not get service credits  all poll workers who extended their work hours due to vote counting machine and other technical problems receive an additional    koko sees contradiction opposition sen  aquilino  koko  pimentel iii said the president s veto message seemed to contradict his administration s  thrust and commitment  to national recovery  he said congress wanted to give incentives to electoral board members by paying them  good rates  and exempting the income from taxes  pimentel was dismayed that marcos overlooked the  difficult and dangerous  tasks that teachers and others in government perform during elections  on the veto of the ptsb bill  sen  grace poe  chair of the senate committee on public services  disputed the grounds cited by marcos  she said it was  unfortunate  and lamented that the government s fiscal position seemed to outweigh the loss of lives in transport accidents  which the measure sought to mitigate  poe said  maritime accidents occurred from  to  and   average deaths on the road occurred yearly during the same period   the senator contradicted the president s view that the ptsb would duplicate the functions and mandates of existing agencies  saying that an independent body to investigate transport accidents was a global standard   having a  ptsb  will contribute to strengthening our transportation structure to improve mobility  put people back to work and spur the economy   poe said   ,0

1834,as various groups prepare to mark the  anniversary of the declaration of martial law next week  president ferdinand marcos jr  denied engaging in historical revisionism regarding his father s strongman rule  the president also defended his late father s imposition of martial law when in power  saying it was necessary because he was simultaneously fighting communist and separatist rebellions    marcos acknowledged  the abuses that occurred  but said they happened  like in any war    martial law was declared because of the two wars we were fighting on two fronts   he said in a recorded interview aired on tuesday on the newly launched alltv channel  referring to the communist insurgency in the countryside and the muslim separatist war in mindanao  the communists  he said  were  fomenting revolution  and  the government had to defend itself    most people do not realize how  close  came to manila and how close they came to large urban centers and slowly gained control   he added  as for the conflict in the south  marcos said the separatists were being supported by foreign countries such as libya  which was the reason why her mother  then first lady imelda marcos  went to the north african country to seek tripoli s help in brokering peace in muslim mindanao   those were the dangers and the perils that the country were facing  and that s why it was necessary to in my father s view at the time to declare martial law because there is really a war   he said  whitewashing corruption the president s remarks are expected to bolster the concerns of critics that he has no intention of distancing himself from the tenure of his father and that this could pose risks to democracy in the philippines  during the campaign  critics said his presidential bid was an attempt to rewrite history by whitewashing corruption and authoritarianism associated with his father s  year rule  the elder marcos and his family fled the  uprising against his rule after he had overseen what many historians have described as one of the worst examples of a kleptocracy in asia    marcos sr  died in exile in hawaii in   but his family later returned to launch a comeback that culminated in his son s election victory in may  decades later  more than   victims of martial law have received reparations from philippine authorities paid for using billions of dollars of recovered wealth plundered by marcos sr  bonifacio ilagan  who was jailed and tortured during martial law  said the late leader stayed in power for  years after imposing martial law  dismissing any suggestion it was due to an emergency situation   marcos jr  became president on the wings of false narratives and negative historical revisionism   ilagan said  atrocities  debts amnesty international placed at over   the number of people who fell victim to martial law atrocities from  to   of these    were arrested    were tortured  and   were killed by the military and the police  under martial law  marcos dissolved congress  transferring all powers to the president  enforced a curfew  banner group assemblies  and authorized the military to arrest individuals on charges of conspiring to take over the government  in the   marcos took out huge foreign loans that his administration could not repay  the country s foreign debt had ballooned to    billion by the end of his rule  from   million in    son of late dictator  the marcos family is also believed to have amassed   billion in ill gotten wealth while in power  asked if he felt hurt when people refer to him as the  son of the late dictator   marcos said he had no reason to feel that way   no  because i know they re wrong  how many times have i been here in this room  where he was in consultation with different groups  a dictator does not consult  a dictator will just say   do this whether you like it or not    how many times have i watched caucuses here  have i watched meetings in this hall  he really spoke to different industries from time to time   really ask   how can we do this  what do you really want    said the president  who was  years old when martial law was declared in     in fact  i would venture to say in most of the following administrations to my dad  there was less consultation with groups  ordinary people  farmer groups  for example  than in my father s time  because i know that everything he did  he did with consultation with whoever  no matter what the system of government was  that s why for me  you can say what you want  that s your opinion  you re wrong   he said  he said he was no longer hurt by the accusations against his father  adding   no  it would hurt me if they were right  but they re wrong  so   as far as he was concerned  the history of the martial law years may no longer be revised because the facts have already been ascertained  but because  victors write history   the marcoses  side of the story was not taught in schools or presented in the media  he said   those reasons  were expounded at great length during my father s time  but of course  the situation got polarized  it s the opponents who are now writing history  and that s what happened  that s why the people learned about it  martial law  that way   he added  plan for textbooks  we recognize the problems that happened  the abuses that occurred  like in any war  all of these things are some things that are already part of history   he said  whenever he is confronted by accusations of historical revisionism  mr  marcos said  he would respond by showing the  many lies  told by his accusers  regarding his proposal to change how martial law is depicted in history textbooks  he said it would only restore  facts  that critics had supposedly distorted   only if they re wrong   they re factual anyway  you can check facts  let s talk about facts  not political opinion  what are the things that actually did happen  that we can show  we can prove  look  we have video  we have photographs  we have records  this actually happened  as opposed to those who say   you know we heard this was how it happened  we have an intelligence  saying so   these became basically rumors that can t be proven  all that we say we can prove  that is why  how can it be a revision of history   he said   you distort history  maybe  when you say that these are actual facts but the interpretation is the spin   he said  ,0
1835,after many years of neglect  the country s salt industry is finally getting much needed attention through a  million revitalization program to be implemented by the department of agriculture  da

production by using the latest technologies to ensure ample domestic supply     salt has been a very important commodity for thousands of years  and has engraved its part in the economic history of the world  the country needs to increase salt production because salt is a food security issue   the project document said   not being able to produce its own local salt will hurt the country s competitiveness and ability to become a successful agro industrial economy  it is clear that to increase local salt production means to increase the salt producing areas   it added  the country has   kilometers of shoreline  yet it buys  percent of its salt requirements from abroad  agriculture undersecretary domingo panganiban had noted that the philippines was not capable of meeting its own salt needs due to the lack of government support  industry profile before putting the plan into action  the da will try to get a clearer picture of the state of the local salt industry  or whatever is left of it  it will begin by profiling  assessing  and shortlisting the existing salt production areas in ilocos region  western visayas and zamboanga peninsula  the national fisheries research and development institute  nfrdi   in coordination with the bureau of fisheries and aquatic resources   bfar  regional field offices and local government units  lgus   will then identify and select project sites in the following regions  ilocos region  central luzon  calabarzon  cavite  laguna  batangas  rizal and quezon   western and central visayas  zamboanga peninsula and northern mindanao  the goal is for the da to come up with a comprehensive profile of salt farmers  producers  traders  distributors  importers and consumers nationwide  and identify areas where efficient salt production can be located  the project will target existing salt farmers and producers  fisherfolk groups seeking to collaborate and adopt the latest technologies to improve the production process  as well as salt producers wanting to revive their operation    training the da will likewise open the dsip to salt producers who are willing to undergo training on appropriate technologies for product formulation  packaging and labeling  they must be registered under the fisherfolk registry system of the lgu or the registry system for basic sectors in agriculture  concerned lgus  in consultation with the fisheries and aquatic resources management council  will then endorse the potential beneficiaries  both the bfar and the nfrdi will select the beneficiaries  who will be given access to the market through linkages with potential buyers  through market matching  and external funding  including grants  credits and investments  clustering and consolidating the production  processing and marketing activities of salt farmer beneficiaries will be conducted to maximize the interventions and assistance to be given by the da under the program   individual salt farmers in a community will be formed into a cooperative to avail of opportunities from cda  cooperative development authority  and other funding agencies   the project guidelines said  this strategy of consolidation aims to escalate local salt production  facilitate transactions with government financing institutions  increase access to government support programs  and acquire close linkages to suppliers  consumers and marketing services  it will also improve production and manufacturing lines that cannot be undertaken by individual units  especially for small scale subsistence producers  technology support the project will also rely on research and capacity building to enhance salt production  processing and packaging technologies  to do so  the nfrdi will concentrate on boosting and sustaining local salt production by providing the necessary production  postharvest and marketing related assistance to the selected salt farmers and project beneficiaries   these involve the development and standardization of processing methods  consumers  acceptability tests  and market research for locally produced sea salt products  as well as revisiting and amending existing policies governing the salt industry  to ensure food safety and product standards  capability building activities  along with production materials  equipment and facilities  will be provided to improve the handling  processing  storage and distribution of salt products  the project will also cover the improvement of the existing holding or storage facility to keep salt products in a hygienic manner  this way  packed salt products stored in a sanitary and enclosed room will be free from contaminants  ,0

1848,president ferdinand marcos jr  on monday said trees should be planted in the denuded uplands of the two maguindanao provinces to prevent a repeat of last week s deadly landslides after seeing for himself what environmentalists for years had been warning the government on what would happen not only in mindanao but also in other parts of the country  marcos  accompanied by maguindanao del sur gov  bai mariam sangki mangudadatu  flew over the areas devastated by the landslides and flash floods that followed heavy rains brought by severe tropical storm paeng  international name  nalgae      i was pointing out to the governor that in all those places where there are trees  the ground did not move  all the damage that you saw on the mountains  it s because they were bald   marcos said   we know and we ve been hearing this over and over again  but we continue cutting trees  so what happens are landslides like those   he said  after his aerial inspection  the president and his party landed at datu odin sinsuat  capital of maguindanao del norte  where he met officials of the bangsamoro autonomous region in muslim mindanao  barmm   almost wiped off map the town includes barangay kusiong  which was nearly wiped off the map by tons of mud  rocks  and boulders that came crashing down on the village on friday last week  the national disaster risk reduction and management council  ndrrmc  reported on tuesday that of  who died in the floods and landslides in barmm   were from datu odin sinsuat  kusiong lies at the foot of the  meter mt  minandar  rescuers on monday waded through thigh deep mud in the village using long pieces of wood to search for bodies buried under the rubble  twelve of the dead in kusiong  including seven from one family  were buried on monday in two mass graves dug by a backhoe  mourners  who survived the landslide  laid flowers and candles at the site    flood control planning  we have shifted our operation from search and rescue to retrieval because the chances of survival after two days are almost nil   said barmm interior minister naguib sinarimbo  the president told officials of barmm  which includes maguindanao del sur and maguindanao del norte  that tree planting should be included in their long term flood control projects   if there had been trees up there  in kusiong  that would not have happened   marcos said   that s unfortunate   i am very clear in my mind that that  tree planting  is something we could have done   he said he could refer them to  plenty  of nongovernmental organizations that could help in reforestation  he did not mention which groups  he also did not say what measures would be taken to stop people from cutting down trees in fragile forests  he said the department of environment and natural resources would also assist them in making tree planting sustainable  adding that during disasters  folks whose crops were destroyed would often resort to logging to make ends meet   the new way to do it is to make the locals themselves the owners of the trees so that they will take care of them   he said   strange  reacting to the president s remarks about the denuded forests  jon bonifacio  spokesperson for the environmental group kalikasan  told the inquirer that it was  strange that it seems like it s only now he s come to appreciate the benefits provided by well conserved watersheds    let s also not forget the massive deforestation that took place under his father s rule   he added  worsened under marcos sr   as marcos jr  just found out  environmental destruction has deadly consequences and  if the government is serious at all about climate change  it needs to put a stop to the destructive mining  megadam and reclamation projects that are cutting down the very forests he s worried about   bonifacio said   in a column published by the inquirer in   former kalikasan spokesperson marjorie pamintuan said that deforestation  further worsened  during the dictatorial regime of the president s father and namesake   the logging industry was controlled by foreign companies and the local elite  some even holding public offices  timber licensing agreements were given out by the marcos regime to loyalists  from  to   the philippines lost  million ha of forests   she said  she wrote the column six months before severe tropical storm  sendong   international name  washi  caused massive floods that rampaged through the cities of cagayan de oro and iligan in december   killing more than   people  due to deforestation and the large amount of rainfall then in the highlands of bukidnon  the floodwaters easily rushed down to low lying areas  in december the following year  typhoon  pablo   international name  bopha  also caused deadly landslides in mountainous areas in davao de oro  which were blamed on mining and logging activities that denuded the once forested slopes of the towns of new bataan and monkayo  nearly   people died  better coordination aside from reforestation  the president also said the regional government should establish its own public works and highways district offices to quickly repair damaged infrastructure during calamities  these offices should be on standby as damaged or destroyed bridges are the most difficult to repair but roads are easier to fix  he said  the president raised the need for improved coordination between the barmm regional government and its local governments units  lgus  in times of disasters and emergencies   and then the  procedures  i know that you are just drawing up your procedures now  but you can see why this is so important   he said  the president said that he also noticed that the regional government and lgus do not have joint operations  which could maximize the use of their assets   in barmm areas or lgus with bigger populations  you should join forces  so that we can maximize  the coordination  should be enhanced   marcos said   ,0

netizen from basilan named yusuf dominic garcia who debunked the tweet of jervis manahan who made it appear leni robredo arrived in basilan on a boat  although  manahan did not say robredo traveled on a small boat from zamboanga city to basilan  how he phrased his tweet left it open for misinterpretation  according to garcia  robredo took the motorized boat from the fuego fuego beach resort to the basilan port  just a short distance away from the said port  garcia claimed that his uncle saw robredo and her entourage arrived by speedboat and yacht and then transferred to the small boat before proceeding to basilan port for dramatic impact  garcia also posted the screenshots of the convo of fellow basilenos talking about robredo and the speedboat and yacht to corroborate his uncle s story

1873,the government should do its part in producing more high quality and higher paying jobs in the country in order to make a serious dent in the unemployment and underemployment rate in the country  especially among the youth  senator sonny angara made this assertion as he stressed that the government cannot be content with just pushing for the creation of the same low paying jobs in the same industries  during the recent hearing of the senate committee on youth  angara noted that majority of the jobs being occupied by filipinos between the ages of  and  are some of the lowest paying in the country  citing philippine statistics authority  the senator noted there are   million total employed youth in the country and the top industries where they are employed are wholesale and retail  repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles  agriculture and forestry  construction  manufacturing  and administrative and support service activities    in   the psa noted that   percent of the filipino youth were unemployed while   percent were underemployed  based on psa s definition  underemployment refers to employed individuals who are still looking for additional work hours or other jobs that can provide them with additional work hours   looking at the top industries  clearly these are not high paying  high quality jobs   said angara  who chairs the youth panel     problema pa din yan kasi ibig sabihin hindi pa din nila napapakain ang kanilang mga pamilya o kaya hindi pa sapat yung kinikita nila sa kanila mga pangangailangan  the problem here is that it means they still cannot provide for their family or their salary is insufficient to cover their personal needs    he further said  according to angara  this the reason why there is a high underemployment rate among the youth  which the psa estimates to be at   million in    it s clear to me that the quality of jobs that we produce is what we should be looking after  we should be asking ourselves and our government agencies should be asking themselves what we can do to help enable the private sector to produce higher paying  higher quality jobs   angara said  angara also noted that young people who lose their jobs or fail to obtain jobs are particularly vulnerable to  scarring   citing a report by the international labor organization  ilo    scarring   he said  refers to the phenomenon where their future labor market outcomes are worse than those of their peers even when the economic conditions where they are situated improve  the lawmaker said these young filipino workers are likely to end up accepting jobs for which they are overqualified  which puts them at risk of being trapped in an employment trajectory that involves informality and low pay   what we need to do is to have the government agencies involved in job creation to help the private sector  particularly the industries and entrepreneurs  to create higher paying jobs for filipinos   angara said  he said this is possible by redirecting public investments towards digital  care and green economies that would not only produce a significant amount of new jobs  but also provide a boost to the country s gross domestic product  gdp  over time   ,0

1875,  robredo is also  lest we forget  a member of the liberal party  lp   the out going ruling party presided over by out going president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii  she ran under the lp banner in partnership with its presidential candidate mar roxas   at the centre of all the chatter surrounding the ascent of leni robredo to the office of the vice president of the philippines lies the question  what will be her role in the administration of president rodrigo duterte  the future does not look too bright for the presumptive  vice president   putting aside the allegations of electoral fraud and the non compliance of the liberal party to commission on election  comelec  rules around the submission of the party statement of contributions and expenditure  soce  that cloud the office of the vice president  there is little robredo has to offer that would be of interest to duterte  robredo  by her own doing  has pretty much locked herself outside of the soon to be president s circle of trust  during the campaign  robredo had all but shot herself on the foot by by issuing evidently ill thought out statements that run counter to duterte s envisioned approach to straightening out the philippines  duterte  if we recall  rose to power on the back of a promise to apply more  shall we say  iron fisted means to crack down hard on rampant criminality in the country  to that  robredo has reportedly vowed to  lead the fight against   on that front  she goes further to assert   for me  it s going to be a huge challenge    she admitted in an interview at the tomb of her late husband  former interior secretary jesse robredo  where she paid her respects before voting   as a general rule  i think the vice president should be supportive of the president in spite of party differences  it s your obligation to the people to work together  but there are some things that can t be compromised   is one of those   robredo said  to be fair  where exactly  human rights  begin and where that hard crack down ends is a point of contention in duterte s vision  police  after all  require justification to shoot and kill criminals under philipine law  however  it is also difficult to justify allowing an official who had categorically expressed an intent to lead a fight  against  you into your team  specially on an initiative that had been the cornerstone of your campaign  indeed  robredo even cited her hometown in naga city  bicol where  she reportedly pointed out  local government there  were able to achieve the same results without resorting to those things   to which duterte responded by assuring her that his government would not interfere with naga city s affairs  according to duterte   i do not also subscribe the style of her leadership  tabla lang kami   she does not like me  i do not like her  so no problem   duterte told reporters in davao city  robredo is also  lest we forget  a member of the liberal party  lp   the out going ruling party presided over by out going president benigno simeon  bs  aquino iii  she ran under the lp banner in partnership with its presidential candidate mar roxas  the lp had  over the course of the campaign  sustained a vicious attack on the persons of all candidates running against its fielded bets  in the heat of the campaign  aquino himself called for a united front against duterte  aquino also referred to duterte as  a future threat to democracy   roxas  for his part  mounted an agressive campaign to follow through on that messaging and  in the final stretch to election day  attempted to forge a last ditch  unity  alliance with another rival candidate  senator grace poe  presumably to combine their respective voters  base in the hope of beating duterte who was  by then leading the polls  roxas reportedly described that call for unity as  a call for decency   as if implying that duterte s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency  roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him  in his statement made during a hastily called meeting with the press at his campaign headquarters  roxas said that what is more important now is the future of the country than the political careers of any candidate   uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship are looming over our country once again   he said   i call for unity  i call for decency  i call for democracy  i call for the rule of law   so desperate was this project to win the election that president bs aquino himself issued a statement in support of it framing the effort as  a demonstration of country before self   essentially saying that duterte s presidency would be the death of philippines  indeed  aquino even insisted that the prospect of a duterte presidency  carried similar dangers to nazi leader adolf hitler   leni robredo was  of course  a party to this vicious vilification campaign  she ran under the lp banner  took to the campaign trail with roxas and aquino  wore the lp s yellow colours  and sang from the same daang matuwid hymn book  perhaps someone should ask robredo what her position is today on that vilification campaign mounted by her party against duterte  it would be wise for robredo s handlers to caution her against even thinking of backpedalling from those statements of her party mates or distancing herself from the lp itself  doing so would be a clear sign that all of what she said under the lp banner and while wearing those yellow shirts during the campaign were all lies ,1

1948,     a gma network report categorically states that the roots of akbayan along with its bitter  albeit similarly left leaning  rival bayan muna  can be traced to the division of the communist party of the philippines and its allies in the     reading john nery gush like a starstruck teenager about senatorial candidate risa hontiveros  akbayan and the liberal party  in his recent inquirer net piece a catholic vote for risa  you could be forgiven for thinking hontiveros is some sort of filipino mother theresa  to nery  hontiveros is a  true child of vatican ii  and  most embodies catholic social teaching   nery also cites how  a group that calls itself catholics for risa hontiveros has circulated a statement online endorsing her as a catholic candidate  noting that   few of the signatories are his friends  some  know only by reputation   of course  no endorsement of a candidate would be complete without a bit of pandering to certain politically charged advocacies   she was  of course  and controversially  among those who led the fight for the reproductive health law  what many of her catholic critics fail to see is that it was precisely her catholic conscience  schooled in the gritty reality of philippine society  that moved her to join the fight   so let me ask mr nery and risa s prayerful followers this  how does one go from being a communist  the true adherents of which are avowed atheists  to suddenly becoming a celebrated catholic pinup  the multiple layers of confounding inconsistencies surrounding the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of the candidacy of risa hontiveros are too hard to ignore  lest we forget risa hontiveros is chairperson of militant leftist group akbayan  there is scant literature on the history of the akbayan partylist  but a gma network report categorically states that the roots of akbayan along with its bitter  albeit similarly left leaning  rival bayan muna  can be traced to the division of the communist party of the philippines and its allies in the   akbayan was formed by those who refused to be associated with both factions   but did akbayan renounce its communist roots  according to a report published on the world socialist web site  no   akbayan was formed in the wake of the break up of the maoist communist party of the philippines  cpp  in the early   every decision made by akbayan over the past two decades has born the stamp of its origin  the nationalist  opportunist and class collaborationist politics of akbayan are the continuation of the stalinist politics of the cpp  what differences now exist between akbayan and its maoist rivals are born out of the contingencies of alliances formed with different sections of the bourgeoisie   interestingly  the  official  history of akbayan as laid out in their  official  website akbayan org is mute on the topic of its commie roots  after twenty years of dictatorship under the marcos regime  formal democracy in the philippines was restored in  through a broad  people power  movement  this democracy  however  proved to favor only the political and economic elite of the country  the moving force behind the anti dictatorship struggle concerned citizens and progressive groups has been relegated to the periphery of decision making and policy implementation  in response  social movements  trade union groups  and political organizations have emerged to challenge state policies through lobbying and pressure politics  despite the dynamism of philippine movements  formal institutions of democracy remained in the hands of the few and the wealthy  it was within this context that the idea of building an alternative  a citizens  political party  first emerged  social movement groups wanted to be part of the formal processes of government  akbayan was thus conceived as an effort to institutionalize people power and thereby deepen philippine democracy consultations on the party building project began in   throughout the country  pro democracy groups were enjoined to help shape the party concept and strategy  aspirations of various sectors labor  peasants  youth  women  gay and lesbians  professionals  overseas filipino workers  urban poor were discussed and consolidated into a program of governance  while ad hoc structures were formed in luzon  visayas and mindanao  four years later  in january   akbayan was formally established through its founding national congress  in may of the same year  the new party tested its strength by participating in the local and party list elections and won seats in the house of representatives  and several local government units   hmmmm   conceived as an effort to institutionalize people power and thereby deepen philippine democracy   that  together with the euphemism that these  social movement groups  of which the founding members of what was to become akbayan were presumably part of  wanted to be part of the formal processes of government  sounds consistent with a third party perspective provided by globalsecurity org on what the agenda of commie movements suddenly made irrelevant by   people power  politics    as a result of the world wide known  people power  revolution in the philippines  the national democratic front  ndf  made a comprehensive analysis on the new situation in the philippines  the new government was viewed as a fragile coalition of the right and bourgeoise liberals  however  the aquino government has a broader power base than the marcos regime  as such  it adopted a critical collaboration stance with the present government fielding some of its members to fill some some post in government  with this style they could penetrate the bureaucracy while waiting for the aquino government to weaken so the ndf goal can be fulfilled   in summary  senatorial candidates who trace their political roots to communism seem to have a talent for metamorphosis to suit the most current political landscape  some remain true to these roots and present themselves for who they really are in their campaigns  others simply sell out to the establishment and jump into bed with the mainstream hands outstretched ready to embrace whatever sort of label and branding it will take to win  to be fair  with the enormous sums of money involved in political campaign  it will really be always all about winnability   even for ex commies ,1

1968,  her  lugaw leni  persona which was one of her longest running brand awareness campaigns  launched during her  response  to the taal volcano eruption in early   evidently did the most damage   manila times columnist bobi tiglao shared in a facebook post yesterday what he later writes in his column today  isko  leni studies confirm marcos jr  is way ahead  is a report on a focus group study commissioned by the campaign team of yellowtard presidential candidate leni robredo  the full slide deck of the report is available on tiglao s fb post and it provides really detailed insight into what is behind robredo s failure to launch and what fuels her rival presidential candidate bongbong marcos s stellar resonance with a large chunk of the voting public  in three points  the study researchers clearly outlined the objectives of these focus groups which they conducted with  class d and e  registered voters of metro manila aged  to  years old  who are  committed and soft voters  of bongbong marcos     to understand  journey on how and why they  support ferdinand marcos jr   bbm     to see what arguments could possibly diminish or erase their support for bbm    to test their openness to supporting vice president leni robredo the insights gleaned by the researchers paint an unsurprising picture of what robredo s campaign strategists are up against in terms of changing perceptions   both of marcos and of robredo   among marcos s supporters and crafting a way forward to achieve this  the following slides from the report summarises key terms used by focus group participants that were noted by researchers most notable are the negative terms associated with robredo that are clear indictments of the dysfunctional messaging that characterised her campaign over the last six to eight months and the pr stunts she engaged in over the five years of her term as  vice president   her  lugaw leni  persona which was one of her longest running brand awareness campaigns  launched during her  response  to the taal volcano eruption in early   evidently did the most damage  amazingly  this piece of collateral persisted into her current  kakampink  campaign where serving lugaw  rice porridge  to supporters remains a cornerstone activity of her sorties  coming in second in the list of failed robredo personal brand development initiatives is her legacy as a minion   no  leader   of the utterly discredited liberal party of the philippines  robredo ran as the lp vice presidential candidate in  and  also under the lp flag  endorsed the ill fated otso diretso senatorial coalition in   despite sad efforts at recolouring her brand to the pink of her campaign today  robredo remains  at her core  a yellowtard  we wrote back then amidst the fallout in the aftermath of this catastrophic stunt   some yellowtard partisans and  activists  expressed dismay over how these stunts may actually be setting back the  cause  and bringing across the wrong message to voters whose preferences they seek to convert to their camp   the research shows that the majority of the work the yellowtards need to do over the remaining campaign period is to undo and correct the damage caused by their own work  can they do this in the less than five months before election day  the report provides some food for thought on the way forward   while people feel  is as brilliant as his father  it is not actually the case if there is a need to harp on martial law  it should come from someone credible and who experienced it firsthand  might need to refrain from voicing her opinion against bbm as it only makes him more  kawawa  and gain public sympathy nonetheless  the researchers go on to spell out some  viable methods to attack bbm   given that they now have a treasure trove of  research  on how to beat bongbong marcos the steps they will take next and the shrill internal conversations that will erupt within yellowtard echo chambers will be an interesting show to sit back and watch over a couple of beers  can the girlettes and manlets of team leni robredo read the map spread right before them  can they even read maps in general  abangan ang susunod na kabanata ,1

1988,disinformation has virtually split the philippines into  multiverses  that have their own versions of realities and  facts   former vice president leni robredo said on tuesday  as she urged filipinos to combat fake news not just through fact checking but also rebuilding trust among one another  during her keynote address in a forum hosted by konrad adenauer stiftung  kas  asia   one of several speaking engagements during a brief return to manila   robredo said that segments of society now exist  with their own facts  their own experts  their own narratives of philippine history and society    we are now a nation split into camps and echo chambers   she said   it s like we live in multiverses  have separate histories  truths and beliefs   at the end of it all  an alternate reality is created  one which seems impenetrable and impervious to logic   since stepping down from the vice presidency  robredo   named in several studies as the no   target of disinformation in the country   vowed to take the lead in the fight against fake news  in the past few months  she had spoken at several ivy league universities about how disinformation has eroded the philippines  democratic institutions and deepened political divides  this splintering  she said  was due in large part to the  architecture of disinformation networks  seeking to push their own agendas and erode public discourse  free data promos robredo was referring to a concept coined by disinformation scholars jonathan ong and nicole curato  whose studies revealed how advertising and pr firms  as well as political operatives  influencers and trolls  all work in concert to seed disinformation and agitate people  bias in social media algorithms and even free data promos provided by telecommunications providers have also greatly narrowed filipinos  access to diverse streams of information  she added  in particular  the free data promos that allow filipinos to access facebook and tiktok two platforms that have been flagged for disinformation essentially narrowed people s access to more information   free access to social media can seem like a good deal until one realizes  since facebook is free  sites like google  or the inquirer  and the philippine star  and other mainstream media outlets which are not available on free data  that regulators have handed over a near monopoly to these platforms   platforms that have algorithmic bias and can be gamed   she said   now  whatever it is that s on free data  that s their only source of information  they can no longer access more legitimate sources of information   she added   that is why the influence of the legitimate media is not the same as before  trolls  who work for the highest bidders  have the same influence if not more than trained journalists who follow codes of ethics   tide can be turned still  robredo was confident that the tide can be turned  when actions are rooted in accountability and action    if the grand strategy of disinformation actors is to stop us from talking to each other  then countering disinformation should be to talk to each other again   she said  more than fact checking initiatives  she said  people should work on  rebuilding structures that enable meaningful public discourse   she also called on social media giants to take responsibility for the networks that thrived under their watch and to come together with civil society groups for solutions  ultimately  she said   we must pull back and situate each lie within the bigger process of disinformation and talk about who is benefiting from disinformation  every story  every lie    rather than get bogged down engaging in combat with each troll we find  we must focus our efforts upstream and holding architects of disinformation accountable  she added ,0

2000, that yellowtard figurehead leni robredo  would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like colmenares as  partners  in  building a nation  smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of yellowtardom cory aquino herself battled these terrorists   documents publicly available from the united states  central intelligence agency  cia  website detail reports on human rights violations that allegedly occurred under the administration of president cory aquino  the documents  dated between the  and the  december   cite reports issued by london based amnesty international that assert that incidences of torture perpetrated by the armed forces of the philippines  afp   have increased since the manila government stepped up its counter insurgency campaign against communist rebels   the cia report also quotes then president aquino who  in her official response to amnesty international  defends her government and points to the communist party of the philippines and its terrorist arm the new people s army  cpp npa  as the more culpable party involved in any human rights abuse happening in the philippines  a report on militant organisations published on the stanford university website describes how the cpp npa is founded on the premise that china is the source of both ideology and resources to effect violent revolution in the philippines  the report also shows the history of the cpp npa s efforts to solicit support from other terrorist organisations around the world   from its  establishment until the  normalization of philippine chinese relations  the cpp npa received support  weapons  and funds from china  however  even though the cpp npa modeled its armed struggle on china s own maoist movement  chinese support for the cpp npa seems to have been limited  the cpp npa also sought support  weapons  funds  and training from like minded groups overseas  including the japanese red army  jra   the maoist factions of the palestinian liberation organization  plo   the sandinistas  the communist party of el salvador  and many other organizations   most disturbing of all is the account of the stanford report of events that sealed the record of the cpp npa as an enemy of the state as well as the baffling way that its current ally  the liberal party  today known as the yellowtards   contributed to the twisting of facts that led to a confused record of these events   in february    sison met with cpp npa central committee members to discuss his plan to attack a manila rally of the liberal party  which opposed president marcos  the purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the cpp npa  on august   three cpp npa members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in manila s plaza miranda before fleeing the city to a cpp npa camp   even back then  the confused nature with which the philippines  political leaders respond to clear acts of terrorism was on exhibit  rather than be unified across partisan interests in condemning a bald atrocity perpetrated by a cold war enemy the liberal party  instead  blamed the attack on the government of then president ferdinand marcos   liberal party members blamed president marcos for the attack  which had killed much of his opposition  marcos  who blamed the cpp npa for the bombing  responded by suppressing leftist political activity and suspending habeas corpus  these measures marked an increase in marcos  power  in response to marcos  repression  hundreds of student recruits joined the cpp npa    meanwhile  sison denied that the cpp npa had been involved in the attack   things haven t changed much in the last half century since  today  it is interesting how the current yellowtard led opposition  its lackeys in big corporate media  and its circle of so called  activists  dishonestly water down the nature of the cpp npa as terrorists and enemies of the state  they denounce  red tagging  of leftist groups as a  ploy  perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups  however there has been no categorical denial of links between the cpp npa and these so called  leftist  groups coming from any of their leaders  indeed  the yellowtards and their presidential candidate  vice president  leni robredo are in bed with legal front groups of the cpp npa as they mount a campaign to prevent the rise of leading presidential candidate bongbong marcos and his running mate sara duterte  they use the buzzword  red tagging  to keep all conversation about the philippines  communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country s university campuses and in the countryside  former rep  neri colmenares who chairs bayan muna  one of the legal fronts of the cpp npa  is a staunch supporter of robredo s bid for the presidency  not surprisingly  colmenares would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding with regard to the cpp npa s terrorist activities  his approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument   one that paints his lot as  victims  of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate  colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions   and eventually kicking the carping makabayan bloc out of office   is a way to weaken the opposition before the  national elections   one of the reasons why they ve been planning to red tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting  so they need a more active tagging  to stifle  dissent   that s the real intention of red tagging  it has been going on since the time of former president ferdinand marcos  to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being red tagged   colmenares said in filipino   the second purpose of red tagging based on our analysis  the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near  and i think  our analysis here  they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey  if there are surveys going out  it does not represent their actual candidates   he added   colmenares even suggests that  red tagging  is to blame for the catastrophic loss the opposition camp suffered in the  mid term elections where every one of the eight bets in their  otso diretso  coalition failed to bag a senate seat   according to colmenares  he and members of otso diretso   the opposition senatorial slate of the liberal party and its allied groups in the  elections   were subjected to red tagging even before the campaign  but allegations died down eventually  which colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda  he thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition  as none of the opposition bets   otso diretso or not   made it to the senate   note that colmenares s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case  these have since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool  filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the cpp npa and the circle of  activists  they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the filipino people in real nation building  that yellowtard figurehead leni robredo  purported  leader  of the philippine opposition today  would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like colmenares as  partners  in  building a nation  smacks of
