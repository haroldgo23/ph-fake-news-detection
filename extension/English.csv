Manila Bulletin,"A New People’s Army member who has pending warrant of arrest for a couple of charges escaped from the arresting cops on Wednesday night, Nov. 23, while warrant was being served at his house at Sitio Patahan, Barangay San Buenaventura in this town. The target suspect of the 2nd Laguna Provincial Mobile Forces (2nd LPMFC) was Janice Javier alias ‘Salma,’ a former member of the Kabataang Makabayan and of Main Guerilla Unit (MRGU) platoon Laguna-Quezon. She has been accused of murder and attempted murder. Javier, along with two companions, managed to escape upon getting a hint from dogs barking on approaching authorities. The police operatives launched a major combat operation to serve the warrant of arrest against Javier around 7 p.m. but upon approaching the hut, where she was staying, the dog barked and caught the attention of Javier’s group, which hurriedly ran away toward a forested area. The police tried to pursue Javier and her two companions — a man and a woman – but failed. The search and clearing were conducted in the rebels’ hut and found three rough improvised explosive devices, black pipes, three detonating cords, three blasting caps, a square box wrapped in packaging tape, three backpacks with personal belongings, a pack of rice, and canned goods.",0

Manila Bulletin,"Fisherfolk organizations staged a peaceful rally from the Boy Scout Circle in Quezon City to Liwasang Bonifacio, Lawton, and Ermita, Manila on Thursday, Nov. 24, urging President Marcos to take action and assert the Philippines’ sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). Around 20 members of Nagkakaisang Mangingisda Laban sa Gutom at Pananakop, Atin Ang Pilipinas coalition: West Philippine Sea Advocates and fishermen from Masinloc, Zambales, and Navotas City staged the peaceful rally in several venues. According to Jonas Conde, 49, Masinloc fisherfolk have experienced harassment while sailing on Scarborough Shoal, West Philippine Sea. He said most of their fishing haul was confiscated and replaced with instant noodles and packs of cigarettes. “Message po ito para sa mahal naming Pangulo Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr., sa mga kasamahan namin mangingisda ng Masinloc Zambales, gutom at walang mahuling isda sa ating dagat ng West Philippine Sea. Sa tuwing kami ay pumapalaot, marami sa amin ang nakakaranas ng pananakot at panggigipit mula sa mga malalaking barko ng China (This is a message to our dear President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr., from fishermen of Masinloc Zambales who are hungry and can’t catch enough fish in ​​the West Philippine Sea. Every time we sail, many of us experience intimidation and pressure from the big Chinese vessels),” Conde said. “Dinadaan kami sa takot gamit ang malalaking missiles. Araw-araw ganito kahirap ang sitwasyon naming mga mangingisda. Tulungan niyo po kami dahil gutom na kaming mga mangingisda ng Masinloc, (We are being terrorized with huge missiles. Every day, fishermen experience this difficult situation. Please help us because we, Masinloc fishermen, are hungry),” Conde added. Conde appealed to the current administration for livelihood support. He said that many small-scale fishers are abandoning their livelihood and seeking other jobs to ease their hunger. “Sana po ay supportahan niyo kami gaya ng pagsuporta namin sa inyo, pakinggan niyo po kami at ang aming mga hinaing (I hope you will support us just as we supported you. Please listen to us and our grievances) ” Conde pleaded to President Marcos. Flory Azucena, 45, whose husband and brother were also fishermen in the West Philippine Sea, said their livelihood capital is often not returned because of gasoline price hikes and the Chinese vessels that threaten fisherfolk. She also said the price of their caught fish only ranges from P30 to P40 per kilo. “Lugi sila kasi minsan hindi pa po sapat sa krudo. Nagkusa na po ako dito kasi kasi may hinaing ang asawa at kapatid ko para naman mapangkinggan kami. Malayo po sila dito kaya ako ang nandito para ipanawagan na sana malaya na silang makapaghanapbuhay (They lose money because sometimes they don’t have enough income even for gasoline. I am here to represent them because my husband and brother are far from here, so I am here on their behalf to fight for their right to livelihood),” Azucena said. Atin Ang Pilipinas coalition also emphasized that the Marcos administration should be consistent in its dealings with China regarding the fishermen’s rights. The fisherfolk also lifted a fishing boat as a symbol of Masinloc fishermen’s suffering and grievances.",0

Manila Bulletin,"CAMP RAFAEL C. RODRIGUEZ, Butuan City – A top official of Caraga Police Regional Office 13 (PRO 13) on Wednesday, Nov. 23, claimed that the government is winning in its fight against the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) in all fronts in Northeastern Mindanao. “Their (CPP-NPA) lost mass-base and the continuous surrender and arrest of their officials, arm regulars, supporters and followers are the basis that the government is already strategically winning,” stressed PRO 13 Regional Director P/Brig. Gen. Pablo G. Labra ll during the 1st Meet The Press Forum held at the PRO 13 Regional Command Multi-Purpose Building here on Wednesday, Nov. 23. “The unified effort, close coordination and focus of military and police operations also led to the dismantling of guerilla fronts, while all-out support of all local government units and line agencies also led the successful operation of the government’s peace and development program,” the top police official in the Caraga region pointed out.From January this year to Nov. 23, about 128 CPP-NPA members were already arrested and 412 voluntarily surrendered to the different units spread in the five provinces and six cities of Northeastern Mindanao, the military said. Just recently, three CPP-NPA members were arrested and another 17 Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) members also surrendered with six small weapons and bomb-making materials including 10 explosives surrendered to various police units in the region, the regional command of PRO 13 also reported. The number one most wanted CTG member on the list of PRO 13, with seven standing warrants of arrest, was also arrested during a joint manhunt operation at Purok 1, Barangay Diego Silang here. In the same forum, Brig. Gen. Labra announced the additional deployment of police forces in various areas in the region, particularly in urban areas in an objective to maintain peace and harmony during the celebration of the ‘Yuletide Season.’Meanwhile, Gen. Labra lauded the men and women of Philippine National Police Caraga for the remarkable accomplishments during the region-wide Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement Operations (SACLEO) last week. The top police official in the region averred that with the intensified anti-criminality campaign and peacekeeping efforts of Caraga cops, the one-day SACLEO led to the apprehension of 299 law violators comprising high-ranking wanted persons, other wanted persons, drug personalities and CTG members. Based on the consolidated data from the PRO 13 Regional Operations Division (ROD), Surigao del Sur Provincial Police Office (PPO) topped in accomplishments on the campaign against illegal drugs with six drug personalities arrested, and in illegal logging with one arrested and P64,920 worth of hot logs confiscated. The Surigao PPO also apprehended 47 violators in fishing, with 50 wanted persons arrested. On the other hand, Agusan del Norte PPO topped in the campaign against illegal gambling with 16 persons arrested and four suspects arrested over possession of loose firearms. Dinagat Islands PPO, Surigao del Norte PPO, Butuan City Police Office (BCPO), Agusan del Sur PPO, Regional Mobile Force Battalion 13, Regional Intelligence Unit, Regional Intelligence Division, and Criminal Investigation and Detection Group also significantly contributed to the overall success of the region-wide accomplishments of PNP Caraga. “I commend all Caraga cops for showing strong commitment and dedication in performing the job as law enforcers. But the work doesn’t end there,” said Gen. Labra. “We will continue our aggressive anti-criminality and anti-insurgency campaign, supported by our more improved Police-Community Relations activities, to ensure peace and order in the region,” stated General Labra.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is set to submit to the Department of Justice (DOJ) additional evidence on the two murder complaints filed against suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gerald Q. Bantag and several other respondents. Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Charlie L. Guhit, a member of the panel of prosecutors conducting the preliminary investigation of the complaints, said the submission of additional evidence was manifested by the NBI on Wednesday, Nov. 23. In a press briefer, Guhit said: “The NBI manifested that it will file supplemental evidence. The Panel directed the NBI to furnish all the respondents the copies of supplemental evidence five (5) days before the next hearing” set on Dec. 5. Bantag, BuCor Deputy Security Officer Ricardo S. Zulueta, and several persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) were charged with murder for the deaths of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” C. Mabasa and inmate Cristito Villamor Palana, who was identified by self-confessed gunman Joel S. Escorial as the alleged middleman in the broadcaster’s slaying last Oct. 3. During the first hearing on Wednesday, Nov. 23, Guhit said that “counsels for the PDLs manifested that their clients will either re-affirm their respective affidavits or submit counter-affidavits in the next scheduled hearing.” During the hearing, Bantag’s counsel, Rocky Balisong, pointed out the mistake in the subpoena issued to his client by the panel of prosecutors. Balisong told the panel that the name written in the subpoena is that of “Gerald Bantag y Soriano” and not the name of his client, Gerald Bantag y Quitaleg. In the same press briefer, Guhit said: “Counsel for DG Bantag, Atty.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Finance (DOF) has vowed to resolve the complicated military and uniformed personnel (MUP) retirement and pension system that continues to take a heavy toll on the government’s yearly budget. Finance Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno said on Wednesday, Nov. 23, that the MUP pension scheme remains a fiscal risk, which the national government cannot no longer afford to just ignore. “That’s the elephant in the room. I always say that. Right now, it is I think P120 billion in the current 2023 budget proposal and that would continue to balloon unless we will address that issue,” Diokno said during his confirmation hearing at the Senate. Reforms in the MUP pension scheme was one of the proposals that the Duterte administration had wanted the Marcos administration to seriously consider. According to the DOF, the the government was spending around P114 billion per year to fund the MUP pension, a hefty and unsustainable amount for the state with a ballooning debt load. The current MUP pension system is non-contributory, hence retirement pensions and benefits are fully funded by the national government through annual appropriations. Diokno said the Marcos administration wants the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), a state-owned firm handling the pension of all government workers, to assume management of the MUP. However, Diokno said the military and uniformed personnel funds should not commingle with GSIS’ existing coffers and should be contributory in nature, especially among new entrants. “If the military pension will be covered by the GSIS… There will be civilian component and a military component,” the finance chief explained. However, Diokno said “we have to respect what has already been committed to those who have retired. So, from now on after the military pension bill was passed, those who will enter, those who are in active service will contribute.” Last July, Jose Arnulfo “Wick” Veloso, GSIS president and general manager, said pension fund was open to cooperate with the national government in instituting reforms in the MUP pension scheme. According to a GSIS actuarial study, the current system entails a total funding requirement estimated at P9.6 trillion. This amount covers the future obligations pertaining to active members and current pensioners of the MUP. If the current system prevails, the national government will be required to allocate around P850 billion to MUP pensions annually for the next 20 years.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) panel of prosecutors has allowed suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gerald Q. Bantag to file his counter-affidavit on the two murder complaints filed against him at the resumption of the preliminary investigation on Dec. 5. Bantag has been charged “as principal by inducement” in two murder complaints for the deaths of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” C. Mabasa and inmate Cristito Villamor Palana, who was identified by self-confessed gunman Joel S. Escorial as the alleged middleman in the broadcaster’s slaying last Oct. 3. Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Charlie L. Guhit, a member of the three-person panel, said extension of Bantag’s filing of his counter-affidavit was granted during the start of the investigation on Wednesday, Nov. 23. Present during the hearing was Bantag’s legal counsel, Rocky Balisong, and co-respondents, persons deprived of liberty (PDLs), who attended via video conferencing. BuCor’s Deputy Security Officer Ricardo S. Zulueta, who was also charged as “principal by inducement,” was not present. Guhit said there were no submissions of counter-affidavits during the Nov. 23 start of preliminary investigation. Aside from Bantag and Zulueta, also named respondents in the Mabasa case were BuCor PDLs Denver Batungbakal Mayores, Alvin Cornista Labra, Aldrin Micosa Galicia, and Alfie Penaredonda. While, in the Villamor case, Bantag and Zulueta’s co-respondents were PDLs Labra, Galicia, Mario Germones Alvarez, Joseph Medel Georfo, Christam Dizon Ramac, Ricky Lamigo Salgado, Ronnie Pabustan Dela Cruz, and Joel Alog Reyes.

The Manila Times,"THE Bicameral Commission on Appointments (CA) on Tuesday, November 11 deferred action on the interim appointment of the former journalist Erwin Tulfo as Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). The CA Committee on Labor, Employment, Social Welfare and Migrant Workers' decision to defer Tulfo's appointment was due to issues surrounding his citizenship and pending libel case before the Supreme Court. Rep. Oscar Malapitan raised the issue of Tulfo's citizenship, noting that the latter became an enlisted personnel of the United States Army from 1988 to 1992. Rep. Rodante Marcoleta, on the other hand, questioned Tulfo about his conviction at the lower court of four counts of libel. The case is now pending before the Supreme Court. During the deliberation on his appointment, Tulfo admitted that he was an American citizen until he renounced it before he was appointed as DSWD head this year. Tulfo requested an executive session to further answer the concerns of Malapitan and Marcoleta. In September, the ad interim appointment of Tulfo was considered bypassed by the appointment body because the scheduled deliberations were not accommodated for lack of time. The Senate adjourned for a recess on October 1. Tulfo was reappointed by President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and his appointment was again submitted to the CA for reconsideration. Tulfo told reporters that he was informed that he will be summoned again by the CA to another meeting that is yet to be scheduled.",0
The Manila Times,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ordered the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to bolster its regulatory powers on small and large-scale mining to ensure that standards are updated and that mining firms are strictly implementing their respective safety and health programs for workers. Marcos made this instruction in a meeting with DENR officials in Malacañang last week. ""We want to legalize small-scale mining firms because many of them are still illegal and the miners have no protection. We want to strengthen the regulatory framework for them to operate legally and to give our miners assistance and protection for a safe working condition,"" Marcos said. He also expressed the need to enhance social protection and security for workers in the mining industry. ""We might be able to access financing, they might be able to access social protection,"" Marcos told DENR officials.""The miners... they have no safety. A lot of them have died,"" Marcos lamented, referring to miners who do not have the proper training or inadequate safety measures inside the mines. On small-scale mining, there are bills that the President may certify as urgent, including the amendment to Republic Act (RA) 7076 to incentivize small-scale mining (SSM) to provide social assistance and labor protection as well as government assistance programs. Under RA 7076, or the ""act creating a people's small-scale mining program,"" SSM pertains to mining activities that rely heavily on manual labor using simple implementation and methods. The law also defines small-scale mining as an activity that does not use explosives or heavy mining equipment. ""I think for now the need is for the regulatory capabilities, especially for the small scale,"" Marcos said. Destructive mining unabated. In Southern Philippines, destructive mining practices both by small-scale and large-scale miners continue unabated. In Zamboanga Peninsula, open-pit mining has become a practice by commercial miners. In Tawi-Tawi province, Languyan town shows the devastation of nickel mining activities there. Environmentalists said nickel mining activities have also destroyed the environment on Tumbagaan Island and other sites in Tawi-Tawi. Mining money was also being used in the past to bankroll political campaigns in the Muslim autonomous region comprising the provinces of Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, Sulu, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao. As early as 2016, the Regional Legislative Assembly of the previous and the now-defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) had asked the DENR to issue an order stopping all destructive mining activities in the Muslim autonomous region. In September 2019, the BARMM said it suspended all nickel mining operations in Tawi-Tawi to pave the way for a review of the region's mining policy. But details of the review were not made public. The Philippines is the world's second-largest nickel ore producer in 2018 after Indonesia, with both Southeast Asian nations as the top two suppliers to China, the biggest buyer. Latest available industry data show that 2.34 million wet metric tons (wmt) of high-grade ore, or nearly 90 percent of 2.66-million wmt of the high-grade material the Philippines exported to China in the first half of 2018 came from Tawi-Tawi.'Cease and desist'. Tawi-Tawi accounted for 27 percent of overall nickel ore exports, totalling 15.8-million wmt, to China during the six-month period. In 2016, then-ARMM Assemblyman Hanibal Tulawie, then chairman of the Committee on Environment and Ecology, said that a resolution was passed asking the DENR to immediately issue a ""cease and desist"" order on all mining companies operating in Tawi-Tawi and also in Basilan, Sulu, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao provinces after he received numerous complaints from the public and environmentalists who are opposed to destructive mining methods. Photos of nickel mining operations in Tumbagaan Island posted on Facebook also showed huge trucks and barges hauling off red soil, which was allegedly being shipped to China where it is processed. There were previous reports indicating that Tumbagaan Island was totally devastated because of mining explorations and the nickel mining activities there. The same thing allegedly happened to Panglima Sugala town. Rehabilitation underway. Then-president Rodrigo Duterte, who was made aware of the mining devastation on the island, has ordered a stop to all mining operations in Tawi-Tawi. Then-cabinet secretary Karlo Nograles said Duterte was very much concerned about reports that Tumbagaan Island has been completely devastated by mining activities. ""The island has, at this point, been mined out. And while rehabilitation efforts are underway, the president is issuing a directive to stop any and all mining,"" he said. Duterte ordered authorities to step up rehabilitation by planting trees in areas devastated by nickel mining. But surprisingly, Duterte did not order an investigation into the mining in Tawi-Tawi or who were the groups behind the environmental destruction. This is allegedly the reason why it was not acted upon by DENR, particularly the Mines and Geosciences Bureau. The DENR earlier expressed commitment to review mining laws, including small-scale mining, to ensure that standards are updated and that the provision of the implementing rules and regulations takes full advantage of remote sensing and innovation in artificial intelligence.",0
The Manila Times,"FORMER senator Francisco ""Kit"" Tatad said negotiation for five more Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the Philippines was the ""highlight"" of the visit of United States Vice President Kamala Harris to the country. Tatad, in a forum organized by the Integrated Development Studies Institute (IDSI), shared the view of fellow speakers professors Butch Valdez and Harry Roque that EDCA ""is unconstitutional."" ""We now have Vice President Harris with us. I don't believe we should overstate the importance of this visit,"" said Tatad, who writes a column for The Manila Times. He said Harris ""perhaps is looking at the next [US] presidential elections and whether she might run for president depends on a number of things and the Philippine visit might have [helped her decide if she would]."" ""But the real issue is EDCA. Now I agree that we have to let go of this. This is unconstitutional. The term used is 'agreed locations.' This I believe is a euphemism for bases,"" Tatad pointed out. The White House, on its website, said the 2014 EDCA builds on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) and the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement. It provides a legal basis for Philippine and American soldiers to undertake joint military exercises and rapid relief efforts during disasters. The new EDCA locations ""have also been identified to enable the United States and the Philippines to continue to work together toward achieving the agreed objectives under EDCA,"" the White House said. Tatad explained, ""In case of war and the Americans start using these agreed facilities, we will able to see that they'll be functioning as nakedly as possible as military bases."" ""We won't get involved there. They will be running these facilities independently on their own without any participation of the Philippine government,"" he said. Roque warned, ""If we are going to put an end to both EDCA and MDT, the Americans would surely take steps to remove [President] BBM ([Ferdinand] Bongbong Marcos Jr.) in the same way that they already removed past presidents and will install a puppet government."" Reacting to Harris' visit in relation to EDCA, the IDSI said, ""Today, we need to focus on building more bridges, not bases. On economic cooperations, not military provocations. The Philippines must avoid becoming the unnecessary central battleground of any powers."" ""A mutual defense agreement under current terms requires the Philippines to enter in any fight of the US and her allies regardless if we agree or not. Since China has no interest in invading the Philippines, what benefit is there for the Philippines to give up its sovereign decision-making to the US?"" it also said in a statement. When asked whether the foreign policy of Marcos can be seen as a shift from the ""independent"" foreign policy of the previous Duterte administration, Tatad said, ""President Bongbong has reiterated it in his own way by saying the Philippines will be 'a friend to all and enemy to none.' That is a statement of independence. And I don't believe he is shifting from that."" ""Besides we have not heard about what commitments the President has made to Vice President Harris and what the United States has committed to the Philippines on her visit,"" he added. ""So, I think we can afford to wait. Find out. Let's hear what we are going to be told. Then we can analyze,"" Tatad said.",0
The Manila Times,"THE Chinese Embassy in Manila has described as ""inconsistent with facts"" the reported tension between the Philippine Navy and the China Coast Guard (CCG) over the retrieval of a rocket debris. The embassy on Tuesday, November 22, shared the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the incident that dispelled the reported stand-off between the two naval forces off Pag-asa Island in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). forces off Pag-asa Island in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea).""Relevant reports are inconsistent with facts. Here's what happened, according to the [spokesman for] the Chinese Foreign Ministry,"" the embassy said in a statement. Around 8 a.m. on November 20, a CCG ship ""found an unidentified floating object in the waters off the Nansha Islands, which was later identified as the wreckage [from] the firing of a rocket recently launched by China."" Before the CCG found the floating object, some Philippine Navy personnel ""already retrieved and towed it,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said. ""After friendly consultation, the Philippine side returned the floating object to the Chinese side on the spot. The Chinese side expressed gratitude to the Philippine side,"" Mao added. ""There was no so-called blocking of the course of a Philippine Navy boat and forcefully retrieving the object at the scene,"" he said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also said it is not against the United States' interaction with regional countries in wake of the visit of US Vice President Kamala Harris to the Philippines. ""But it should be good for regional peace and stability and not damaging to other countries' interests,"" Mao said. The Philippine government will send a note verbale to China in connection with the Pag-asa Island incident, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said on Tuesday. ""Yes, I think that's what we need to do,"" the President said in a chance interview at the sidelines of the 49th founding anniversary celebration of the Career Executive Service Board in Pasay City. National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos had recommended the filing of the note verbale. Carlos expressed hope though that Beijing will understand the supreme national interest of the Philippines when protecting its territory and people. Also as of Tuesday, she said, there had been no reports of additional military activities within the artificial islands built by China around the West Philippine Sea. According to Marcos, the note verbale aims to resolve conflicting incident reports of authorities from both countries. ""When it was first reported to me by the [Armed Forces of the Philippines] chief of staff, I asked him to immediately call [the Philippine] military attaché in the Chinese Embassy and to get a report,"" he said. It was not the first time that pieces of ""metallic"" debris was found in the Philippines. Last October, such debris was found floating off the waters of Palawan and Occidental Mindoro believed to have come from a Long March 5B rocket that China had launched. Pag-asa Island is the second-largest of the Spratly Islands and the largest of the Philippine-administered areas located about 480 kilometers west of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, close to the disputed waters of the South China Sea. Last week, at his participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Thailand, Marcos renewed his call for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea to be drawn up ""as soon as possible."" He said member economies had a consensus on the urgency of the COC as this is meant for the ""full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea."" The President also appealed to all claimants to contested territories to make the South China Sea an area of peace and stability, not of armed conflict or political discord, reminding them that they have ""a moral and legal obligation to work toward finding resolutions and not resort to inciting conflicts.""",0

""You really need a sense of humor because there are lots of challenges that will come your way, and sometimes you just have to be able to weather them and to put things in proper perspective. So he will definitely be an asset to our President, and definitely to our country and our countrymen,"" Poe said. Sen. Maria Josefa Imelda ""Imee"" Marcos sponsored Diokno's confirmation. ""The global economic devastation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic — today demands the most committed and tested of men which certainly our secretary is. With his qualifications and experience and character we are certain he will be more up to the task,"" Marcos said. Diokno was Budget secretary from 1998 to 2001 during the term of President Joseph ""Erap"" Estrada and from 2016 to 2019 during the term of President Rodrigo Duterte. He was also a former governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Diokno was a staunch critic of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs), saying they ""scare away"" foreign investors amid security concerns. ""If we continue to have POGO here, whereas it's already declared illegal in other countries like China they don't like POGO there, then that will reflect in our country. Those who would like to invest here will not come here because of that reputation that they are not secure,"" Diokno said. Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said business leaders in the country supported the appointment of Diokno as the secretary of Finance. Meanwhile, Bersamin said President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. is committed to appoint a permanent Agriculture secretary. ""The President is seriously considering several people to appoint on a permanent basis or regular basis to represent or minister the DA (Department of Agriculture) portfolio,"" he said. ""But he has not signified to us that he is ready to announce his decision. But for now he is addressing all these problems together with the Cabinet particularly those that are relevant to food production and food security,"" he added.",0

The Manila Times,"THE Department of National Defense (DND) maintained that the Chinese coast guard ""rudely took"" what is believed to be part of a rocket debris that Philippine naval forces recovered in the waters of Pagasa Island near Palawan. DND Officer in Charge Jose Faustino Jr. said Monday the department is standing by its version of the incident after Beijing issued a statement denying that its coast guard forcibly took the object being towed by a Philippine naval vessel. The Chinese foreign ministry said that the object was taken by its coast guard after a ""friendly consultation"" with Philippine authorities. But Faustino strongly denied it. ""We stand by the accounts of our personnel in the area that, contrary to the narrative of the Chinese side, the debris being towed by a Philippine vessel to Naval Station Emilio Liwanag for inspection was rudely taken by personnel from CCGV5203,"" he said, referring to the Philippine Coast Guard vessel. Philippine authorities are also investigating the reported explosions, allegedly artillery fire, that occurred after the incident. Faustino said the DND is waiting for the official reports on the consecutive incidents near Pag-asa Island, which have rekindled tensions in the West Philippine Sea. ""The situation is still developing; thus, we cannot provide additional details at this time,"" he said. Faustino said the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and other government agencies are now in the area to ensure the safety of Pag-asa residents. ""Events such as these are exactly why we continue to advocate for open lines of communication and dialogue mechanisms. We support the diplomatic efforts of Philippine government agencies to engage our Chinese counterparts to address the incident,"" he said. In its own narrative of the incident, the Chinese embassy in Manila said that at around 8 a.m. Sunday, ""a China Coast Guard ship found an unidentified floating object in the waters off the Nanshan Islands, which was later identified as the wreckage of the fairing of a rocket recently launched by China."" The Nanshan is part of the Spratly chain of islands that is being claimed by both the Philippines and China.

In its own version, the AFP Western Command said a team from Naval Station Emilio Liwanag (NSEL) retrieved the floating object and was towing it back to the station.

The Manila Times,"ZAMBOANGA CITY: Close to 400 government militias in the southern Philippine province of Sulu are set to undergo military training as part of a security task force that will help protect marine environment and enforce coastal laws. The 11th Infantry Division (11ID) will facilitate the training of the Task Force Bantay Dagat which is composed of some 380 Special Cafgu Active Auxiliary members. They will conduct maritime patrol utilizing 95 motorboats, according to Army Lt. Col. Abdurasad Sirajan, a spokesman for the Western Mindanao Command. This was also confirmed by Gov.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla has asked the National Bureau of Investigation to reach out to the family of Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Deputy Security Officer Ricardo Zulueta, whose whereabouts remain unknown. “Yes, I’m asking the NBI to contact his family,” Remulla told reporters on Thursday. Zulueta is one of the alleged masterminds behind the murders of radio broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa and alleged middleman Cristito “Jun Villamor” Palaña. He supposedly relayed the kill orders for Mabasa and Villamor to gang leaders inside New Bilibid Prison. The NBI earlier said that efforts to locate Zulueta were ongoing after he was reported absent without leave from the BuCor and in hiding from authorities. Absent at hearing Zulueta and the other alleged mastermind, suspended BuCor Director Gen. Gerald Bantag, were no-shows during the Department of Justice’s preliminary investigation of the murder complaints on Wednesday. But while Bantag’s lawyer, Rocky Balisong, attended the proceedings on his behalf, no counsel represented Zulueta, according to Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Charlie Guhit, who is part of the three-member prosecution panel. Remulla believed that the error on Bantag’s middle name in the subpoena would not affect the murder complaints against the former BuCor official and several other respondents. “It’s not a fatal mistake. I’m looking at the case right now… It was not a grievous error,” he said. Guhit had expressed the same opinion on Wednesday, saying the error would not affect the case, especially because Balisong had received a new subpoena for his client on the same day. Subpoena remedied Balisong on Wednesday said that the subpoena he received on Monday requiring his client to attend the hearing had been addressed to a “Gerald Soriano Bantag.” Pointing out that Bantag’s middle name was Quitaleg, the lawyer said the error was a “fatal” defect in the case as the name referred to a different individual. Remulla also said that authorities were continuing to work on the case. “Case buildup is ongoing even if the case has been filed already. You know these are not simple cases. These are very novel cases in terms of the way the case was solved and the way that the evidence came into being. That’s why the work should be nonstop,” he added. At the same time, he said he was not keen on allowing the preliminary investigation to be covered by the media. “The respondents still have privacy rights due to presumption of innocence. If we do that it’s like we are condemning them already. We don’t really want to make a spectacle of that proceeding,” he explained.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Despite forecasts from analysts that the rate of growth of the Philippine economy will slow down after the 7.6 percent reported for the third quarter of 2022, the government is pushing for the same pace or even higher gear, according to Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman. “We hope to sustain this growth, if not surpass it, and we believe that enhancing our digital governance will play a crucial role in achieving this,” Pangandaman said in a statement. She added that the institutionalization of budget reforms and digitalization of public financial management or PFM have been her top priorities since assuming office at the Department of Budget and Management. Pangandaman said that by investing in digital infrastructure, the government could improve its revenue collection as digitalization promotes efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public funds. Speaking at the Pilipinas Conference 2022 organized by the Stratbase Albert del Rosario Institute on Monday, Pangandaman emphasized the need to leverage digital interventions as part of the Marcos administration’s sustainable development programs. “Our country needs to fully embrace and transition to digitalization, especially on government processes and business models,” she said. Related to this, the Philippine Statistics Authority more than 2 million Filipinos now have the printed version of their electronic or digital national IDs. This was achieved amid efforts to enable citizens to immediately enjoy the benefits of the PhilSys ID while they address the backlog on the issuance of plastic IDs. Such benefits include faster and seamless transactions in accessing financial and social protection services that require proof of identity, subject to authentication. According to the PSA, the printed digital ID is designed to have the same functionality and validity as the physical card. PSA Undersecretary Dennis Mapa, National Statistician and Civil Registrar General, said, “We would like to underscore that every registered person will receive their physical card even if they have already claimed their printed ePhilID.” Mapa reiterated that, just like with the physical card, claiming a printed ePhilID is free of charge.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Commission on Audit (COA) Chair Gamaliel Cordoba on Wednesday failed to get the endorsement of the legislative Commission on Appointments (CA), which suspended his confirmation hearing after Sen. Risa Hontiveros raised his role in the shutdown of ABS-CBN network. Cordoba’s confirmation was suspended a day after Social Welfare Secretary Erwin Tulfo also failed to get the nod of the bicameral panel. Visibly looking uneasy, Cordoba fielded questions from Hontiveros as he defended his decision as then chair of the National Telecommunications Commission to order the Lopez-owned media company to stop its operations on May 5, 2020, a day after its legislative franchise expired. As has been done in the past, any CA member can indefinitely defer the confirmation of any appointee subject to confirmation under Section 20 of the CA rules. Hontiveros said the closure of ABS-CBN resulted in the mass layoff of about 11,000 employees and was seen as an attack on press freedom. The senator is an older sister of noted broadcaster Pia Hontiveros, who worked at ABS-CBN from 1989 to 2011. The senator also chided the COA chair for reneging on the commitment he made during a hearing of the House of Representatives that he would issue a probationary permit allowing ABS-CBN to continue operating while Congress was still deliberating its application for a new congressional franchise. “How can the public trust your integrity as COA chair if you broke the promise and commitment you made under oath?” Hontiveros asked Cordoba. “Public officers must, at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency,” she said. But Cordoba defended his decision, arguing that it was consistent with a previous ruling issued by the Supreme Court regarding the issue of an expired legislative franchise. “Of course, while it was legal, I understand that it was really unfortunate. That’s why I apologized to those who were affected,” Cordoba said. “Again, I want to apologize. Forgive me. I just had to follow the rule of law,” he said. Unlike Cordoba, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno breezed through their respective confirmation hearings. ‘Keep on going’ Tulfo was also bypassed on Tuesday, but he said in a news forum on Wednesday that President Marcos asked him to “keep on going” and continue with his work. “The instruction to me was to keep on going, as told by the President. My [ad interim] appointment is only until March 4 of next year, so, even if I was bypassed, I have until March 4 before the CA could confirm my appointment,” Tulfo said at the the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. He said he asked the President “for guidance and then he just told me to ‘just do your job.’” “He (President Marcos) did not tell me to ‘do this’ or ‘do that.’ All he told me was to get ready and let [the lawmakers] do their jobs,” Tulfo said, adding the President also does not want to interfere with the CA. Among issues raised against Tulfo during his confirmation hearing was his American citizenship being a member of the US military from 1988 to 1992, based on a report submitted to the CA. Tulfo admitted that he became an American citizen in 1988 and that he only regained his Filipino citizenship this year in compliance with requirements for his appointment to the Cabinet. However, he had clarified that he got his American citizenship not because of joining the US military, but for other reasons he could not divulge publicly. Also raised against him was a conviction for libel as raised by Sagip Rep. Rodante Marcoleta, an ally of the Marcos administration. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The country’s debt is “manageable” and should not be a “cause for concern,” Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno said on Wednesday. As of end-July, the country’s debt climbed to P12.89 trillion, Bureau of the Treasury figures showed. “Actually, our public debt is manageable, let’s put it that way. It should not be a cause for concern,” Diokno said in a Commission on Appointments panel debate on his ad-interim appointment. According to the official, the country’s debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Although we came from a very low debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 40 percent before the pandemic, it went up to around 62 percent because of the pandemic because we have to buy the vaccines, we have to beef our health services, etcetera,” Diokno explained. PH debt climbs to P12.89 trillion by end of July. “That should not be a cause for concern. Sixty-two percent, that’s very manageable compared to other countries whose debt-to-GDP ratio is 200 percent… 100 percent as in many European countries,” he added. Outgrowing the country’s debt, Diokno said, would address the current debt-to-GDP ratio. The Finance chief stressed the government has a “very strong economic strategy which will make the economy grow by 6.5 to 8 percent” in the next six years. “So, higher revenues, stricter on the expenditure side, I think we can manage our debts,” Diokno said. The Philippine debt is projected to reach P14.63 trillion by the end of the year. PH debt seen to hit new high of P14.63T by end-2023. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos on Tuesday said the Philippine government would be sending a note verbale to China regarding the incident near Pag-asa Island where Chinese coast guard personnel reportedly retrieved forcibly a piece of rocket debris that the Philippine Navy had recovered last Sunday. “Yes, I think that that’s what we need to do,” the President replied when asked about National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos’ recommendation to send the diplomatic note regarding the latest West Philippine Sea incident. Mr. Marcos briefly spoke to reporters after addressing the 49th founding anniversary celebrations of the Career Executive Service Board at the Philippine International Convention Center. He recounted that after Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Lt. Gen. Bartolome Bacarro reported the Sunday incident to him, he asked Bacarro to immediately call the military attaché at the Chinese Embassy to get a report. “The report of the Philippine Navy and the report from China did not match because the word ‘forcibly’ was used in the Philippine Navy report. And that was not the characterization in the Chinese navy report or the report coming from China,” the President said. “So we have to resolve this issue. Of course, I have complete trust in our Navy and if this is what they say happened, I can only believe that that is what happened,” he added. The President said Chinese officials would be asked to shed more light on their contradictory version of the incident. “So we have to now ask the Chinese: Why is it that their account is so different and it’s much more benign—shall we use that word—because the word ‘forcibly’ was used, at least in the initial reports of the Philippine Navy,” he said. Avoiding miscalculations Mr. Marcos said he would also raise the incident to Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visits Beijing next year. “So we’ll find a way to resolve this. This is one of the things, these kinds of incident are some of the things that [we have to resolve]. I’m glad that I am going to Beijing early January because these are the things that we need to work out,” he said. The President also said he wanted miscalculations avoided as he aired his desire to keep tensions from getting out of hand through mutually agreed mechanisms. “Because with the way that the region, our region, [the] Asia-Pacific, is heating up, someone might commit an error [or] if there’s a mistake, there’s a misunderstanding, then the fire might get worse,” he said. “So we don’t want that to happen. So we want to have a mechanism. We have to find a way for this not to happen again, [so] that we won’t have incidents like this anymore,” he added. Carlos, who is concurrent chair of the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS), disclosed her recommendation to send a diplomatic note in an interview over radio station dzBB on Tuesday. She noted, however, the Philippines used to send notes verbales in the past when such incidents happened. “We’ll say that [President] Xi Jinping and President Bongbong [Marcos] have just spoken in [Thailand during the Asia- Pacific Economic Conference Summit] and there they said they will really focus on constructive engagement and critical dialogue, and now this happened again,” Carlos said. Dialogue She said the Chinese leadership under Xi should be put to task for failing what they had committed to do. “This happened again, this keeps on happening. So what is that all about? What’s the sense of what their leadership [under President] Xi Jinping had said? Is that empty?” she asked. Carlos, however, said Manila remained open to the peaceful resolution of its conflicting maritime claims with China in the West Philippine Sea. “We are not at war with this country (China) so let’s continue to dialogue. We wish China also understands where our supreme national interest lies. Our supreme national interest is protecting our territory, and protecting the Filipino people, in our seas,” she said. The tense confrontation at sea took place just three days after the bilateral meeting between Mr. Marcos and Xi. The China Coast Guard twice blocked a Philippine naval boat towing the suspected rocket debris and deployed an inflatable boat with some of its personnel on board to cut the towing line between the debris and naval boat. The Filipino sailors returned to the island without the debris. China Coast Guard ships have in the past blocked Philippine boats on resupply missions to soldiers stationed in its detachments in the West Philippine Sea, but Sunday’s incident was the first time that it seized an object in the possession of the Philippine military. The Chinese Embassy has denied the Philippine military’s account and said it was “inconsistent with facts.” “Before the China Coast Guard found the said floating object some Philippine Navy personnel already retrieved and towed it. After friendly consultation, the Philippine side returned the floating object to the Chinese side on the spot,” it claimed. It added: “The Chinese side expressed gratitude to the Philippine side. There was no so-called blocking of the course of a Philippine Navy boat and forcefully retrieving the object at the scene.” A series of blasts were also heard by Pag-asa Island residents after the maritime encounter, which they said were strong enough to jolt the ground. Pag-asa’s police said “the repetitive sounds [were] believed [to have come] from artillery guns/weapons” from Chinese-held Zamora (Subi) Reef about 26 kilometers away—one of seven man-made islands built by Beijing in the disputed Spratlys.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Philippine National Police denied allegations from international rights group of an “undercounting” of drug war deaths under the Marcos administration, saying it was ready to present its data. “The PNP is denying reports that there is underreporting [of drug war deaths]. The PNP does not have a history of underreporting. In fact, we are very transparent in terms of our police operations and accomplishments,” Col. Jean Fajardo, spokesperson for the PNP, said in a radio interview on Monday. Last week, Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr., chief of the PNP, reported that 46 people had been killed by law enforcers in antidrug operations since President Marcos took over. He called the figure “very minimal,” saying the government’s antidrug campaign had shifted to reducing demand and engaging different sectors. But international rights watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) countered his claim and in an article dated Nov. 17, Phil Robertson, the group’s Asia division deputy director, said that the PNP was downplaying the death toll. The PNP’s figure is smaller than the 127 drug-related killings — 57 of them by state agents, including police — recorded in the “Dahas” study conducted by the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center and the Development Studies of Ghent University in Belgium. The study includes a running count of drug-related killings based on media reports. The current figure released on Thursday last week was culled from July 1 to Nov. 7. “Even if one accepts the PNP’s figures, calling this death toll ‘very minimal’ smacks of insensitivity and callousness. Since the antidrug campaign began seven years ago under then-President Rodrigo Duterte, thousands of families of people gunned down have been crying out for justice,” Robertson said. Fajardo, on the other hand, questioned where and how the running study was getting its data. “But again, on the part of the PNP, we are really transparent and we can open our data if we really have to prove it,” she said. “Our police operations are tallied into the data system of the PNP. It will be very difficult to change that because that is in the system of the PNP,” she added. But it was only recently that authorities — at the very least, the PNP — became open about its drug war data. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Bohol Gov. Aris Aumentado on Monday sought the support of his fellow elected officials and partner agencies as he leads the Regional Development Council (RDC) in Central Visayas. Among his programs is to ensure Central Visayas’ recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastation caused by Typhoon Odette (international name: Rai) in December last year. “With humility, I ask for your full support. Please work with me in ensuring that our beloved region achieves sustainability in the areas of food security, economic progress, inclusive growth, shared prosperity, good governance, and better lives for everyone,” he said. Aumentado was appointed chair of the RDC by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. last month. He will serve for a fixed term of three years. In his speech after he took his oath of office before Judge Jennifer Chavez-Marcos of the Regional Trial Court Branch 2 in Bohol on Monday, the governor said he did not expect to be entrusted with another responsibility. “Having just been given the overwhelming mandate of the Boholano people in the May 2022 elections, I did not expect that I would again be entrusted with another great responsibility,” Aumentado said. Support Under his watch, Aumentado said major priority programs and projects in Central Visayas would be given fair support. He was hopeful to unite the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor and Negros Oriental. “I am 100-percent committed to this responsibility, directing Central Visayas toward becoming an even more progressive and united region against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastation of Typhoon Odette,” he said. In a special meeting on Aug. 22, the RDC passed Resolution No. 44 endorsing Aumentado as its new chair and private sector representative Kenneth Cobonpue, the council’s former chair, as its new co-chair. Aumentado said his late father, former Bohol Gov. Erico Aumentado, was his inspiration to serve the people and the region.“My father once served the RDC beyond the call of duty. I, too, will devote all my heart and mind for our beloved province of Bohol and the entire Central Visayas,” he said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Despite projections of a global recession, the Philippines is not going into one,  Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno said on Wednesday. During the deliberations of a Commission on Appointments committee, Camarines Sur 2nd District Representative Luis Raymund Villafuerte asked Diokno about the government’s plan to mitigate the impact of a looming global recession. “I can assure you that, given the data that we have under very extreme conditions, we will not have a recession because we have a very young population,” Diokno told lawmakers. The global economic decline, the chief said, will not affect the country because of improvements in the local economy. “For example, our unemployment rate is now down to 5 percent, which is the lowest since before the pandemic. I can assure you, given our focus on agriculture, we restored mining, our industry and manufacturing are working well, we have opened up the overseas workers, and we have increased the quality of our overseas workers,  I don’t think we’ll have a recession,” he explained. While Villafuerte said he believed in the leadership of Diokno, he said the Philippine government should prepare for the impending global recession. “We also have to consider the global economy vis-a-vis our country,” the congressman said. Diokno then pointed out that the country’s economy is “domestic-driven.” Further, Villafuerte said the national budget of P5.268 trillion for next year would help mitigate the impact on the local economy of  a global economic downturn.

The US Embassy in Manila said she left Yokota Air Force Base on board a flight to Los Angeles late Tuesday afternoon. Harris arrived at the Puerto Princesa City airport on board a US aircraft at 12:05 p.m. From there, she went to Barangay Tagburos to meet with the fisherfolk community, then met with other residents before she boarded the Philippine Coast Guard’s BRP Teresa Magbanua to address her audience of provincial and military officials, Coast Guard personnel, and the media. Harris said from the ship’s deck, “Here in the South China Sea and around the world, to uphold the international rules and laws in South China Sea is to support the lives through the region.” She added: “As an ally, the United States stands with the Philippines in the face of intimidation and coercion in the South China Sea, [and] we support the 2016 ruling of the UN (United Nations) arbitral tribunal which delivered a unanimous and final decision formally rejecting China’s expansive South China Sea maritime claims.” “The [Hague] tribunal’s decision is legally binding, and must be respected,” the US vice president said further. “We will continue [to support] our allies and partners against unlawful and irresponsible behavior.” Okay with China The US vice president reaffirmed her country’s “unwavering” commitment to defending the Philippines if its vessels or aircraft were attacked in the South China Sea. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire sea and has ignored the 2016 ruling against its claims. The ruling was based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to which Beijing is a signatory. Washington has a decades-old security alliance with the Philippines that includes the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the 2014 pact which allows the US military to store defense equipment and supplies on five Philippine bases. China on Tuesday said it saw no problem with Harris’ visit, particularly to Palawan. “We are not against the US interaction with regional countries. But it should be good for regional peace and stability and not damaging to other countries’ interests,” the Chinese Embassy in Manila quoted Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning as saying. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) continues on Wednesday the preliminary investigation of the murder of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa and the death of New Bilibid Prison (NBP) inmate Cristito “Jun Villamor” Palaña. Suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gerald Bantag, former BuCor deputy security officer Ricardo Zulueta, and 10 inmates have been ordered to appear before the DOJ panel of prosecutors at 9 a.m. for the proceedings. But Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, in an interview with CNN Philippines, said it was not necessary for Bantag to attend because he could just ask his lawyers to represent him. Bantag’s lawyer, Rocky Balisong, said his client’s presence would depend on the allegations in the complaint against him. “It depends on what will happen on Wednesday. If we will submit a counter-affidavit and the panel requires that it should be subscribed before them, then we will bring him with us. But we will see if it can be subscribed before other prosecutors … maybe he doesn’t have to come with us,” he said. During the preliminary investigation, respondents submit their counter-affidavits in response to the charges against them. The prosecutors will then decide whether or not to charge and prosecute them in court. The preliminary investigation hearing will cover the consolidated cases of the murders of Mabasa on Oct. 3 and Palaña on Oct. 18. 2 cases consolidated The two cases were consolidated with an earlier case on the first set of suspects in the Mabasa killing. The first list of suspects included confessed gunman Joel Escorial, his three cohorts who remain at large, and inmate Christopher Bacoto, whom Escorial identified as one of the middlemen (along with Palaña) acting on orders of the suspected mastermind. Should the prosecutors find probable cause to charge Bantag in court for the deaths of Mabasa and Palaña, Remulla advised him to face the case, otherwise he would be a fugitive of justice. Remulla also said the preliminary investigation would proceed even if Zulueta fails to appear before the panel. “The rumors that he is dead are there. I was informed a few days ago about it, but the case will still stand as it is, so let it be,” he added. In the same interview, Remulla said the extreme “culture of entitlement” in NBP had led to irregular activities, including land-grabbing, among some officials and personnel. “They treated the land as their own … the problem in the NBP, even before the time of [Bantag], the tendency of people in the BuCor, even in the past generations, is to claim the land,” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Federations of government unions have joined calls for wage hike and security of job tenure, urging the government to raise the national minimum salary to be able to earn a living wage. Citing the erosion of purchasing power of the peso due to rising inflation, government workers on Tuesday urged the President to “take urgent steps to address the worsening plight of workers in government.” “Present policies like the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) and the Compensation and Position Classification System (CPCS) have deprived us of salaries and benefits we need to make ends meet,” said Santiago Dasmariñas Jr., national president of Confederation for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government Employees said. The SSL was designed to rationalize and increase the pay of public sector employees, while CPCS is a standardized compensation package for workers in government-owned and controlled corporations. The labor unions called for an increase in the minimum wage rate of government employees to P33,000 per month, which they said was based on current family living wage standards. Based on the third tranche of the Salary Standardization Law effective Jan. 1 this year, a new hire assigned with a Salary Grade 1 post will get a monthly pay of only P12,517. Based on the preliminary data of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, a family of five needed at least P12,030 to meet both basic food and non-food needs.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Erwin Tulfo’s designation as Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) secretary may be in limbo as the powerful legislative Commission on Appointments (CA) on Tuesday deferred his confirmation due to legal issues over his citizenship and criminal conviction for libel. As if turning the tables on Tulfo, CA members quizzed the former broadcaster and tabloid columnist about his personal life and previous careers before joining the Marcos administration. The DSWD secretary-designate is one of the four Tulfo brothers in the broadcast industry, whose brand of brash journalism has earned them huge followings on social media. His younger brother, Raffy Tulfo, was elected senator in May. Speaking with reporters after the three-hour proceedings, Tulfo admitted he became an American citizen in 1988. He regained his Filipino citizenship only this year as part of the requirements for his appointment as a public official. He added that he had anticipated the matter to be raised at the hearing. “That’s why I brought the documents with me. I came prepared,” he said. “The decision [regarding my confirmation] will be in their hands.” The issue was raised by Caloocan City Rep. Oscar Malapitan, who disclosed that Tulfo was a member of the US military from 1988 to 1992 as stated in the report given to CA members. Joined US military Sagip Rep. Rodante Marcoleta said Tulfo’s records also revealed he was in “active military service stationed in Europe” from 1992 to 1996. “Did you renounce your Filipino citizenship?” Malapitan asked Tulfo. Instead of directly answering the question, Tulfo moved for a closed-door session with the CA members, who swiftly granted his request. After an hourlong executive session, Bacolod City Rep. Greg Gasataya, who presided over the proceedings, adjourned the hearing and deferred Tulfo’s confirmation as the CA discussed his predicament. Tulfo later clarified that he had applied for American citizenship not because of his decision to join the US military. “I cannot divulge that. I’m sorry,” he told reporters. But Marcoleta pointed out that only individuals who had secured their American citizenship either by birth or naturalization may serve in the US forces. He also noted that Tulfo was previously found guilty of libel, an offense deemed as a crime involving turpitude.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Philippines has invited a special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, and arbitrary executions as part of its capacity building under the United Nations Joint Programme (UNJP), Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said on Monday. “We also invited a third one on extrajudicial killings (EJKs) because we want to increase and do capacity building for our forensic pathologists in the country,” Remulla said at a press briefing, referring to Morris Tidball-Binz, a physician from Chile who specializes in forensic science, human rights, and humanitarian action. “And he welcomed our invitation… Actually, our invitation was more of a follow-up already on an agreed program that we had in the UNJP for capacity building of our forensic pathologists so that we can train more forensic pathologists in the country,” the justice secretary said. Tidball-Binz, he said, is expected to visit the country by early next year, adding that the government’s invitation shows that the Philippines is “a country open to suggestions and a country that does not deny that there are problems within the system… and [is] open to improving whatever situation there is.” There are only two licensed and internationally recognized forensic pathologists in the country—Doctors Raquel Fortun and Cecilia Lim. “The rest of them are medicolegal experts but not the level of forensic pathologists that we want,” Remulla said. ‘Armed movement, terrorism’ Two other UN special rapporteurs are scheduled to visit the Philippines—Mama Fatima Singhateh, a special rapporteur on the trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, and Irene Khan, a special rapporteur on freedom of expression and media. According to the Commission on Human Rights, Singhateh will be in the country from Nov. 28 to Dec. 8, while Khan will arrive next year. According to Remulla, the government hopes to engage the rapporteurs in a special dialogue “on any issue that they want to bring up.” He added: “We don’t hide and say ‘that’s not true.’ What we’re saying is that if there’s room for improvement, we will take it on and I think it’s the attitude that is really healthy for international relations.” “It’s a caring gesture that they want to show us and we also reciprocate this caring gesture by being open to all of these suggestions to our country,” Remulla said. But he also hit back at some groups that were critical of his visit to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during last week’s Universal Periodic Review of the country’s human rights situation. “[W]e noticed that a lot of [these groups] that were very, very critical of what we were doing—these are the same organizations that only go to Europe to destroy the image of our country,” he said. “These are civil society organizations that are somehow linked to the armed movement against government, linked to terrorism, those who cry about red-tagging, those who cry about these issues. They are the ones who destroy us. Otherwise, I think we are in the right direction,” Remulla said.Same-sex marriage Remulla earlier led a delegation to the UNHRC which accepted 200 recommendations on human rights by the council, notably a commitment to not revive the death penalty. The delegation also said it would “examine” 89 others, such as the recommendations to cease the policy of Red-tagging. Meanwhile, Remulla said the Philippines cannot accept a recommendation on upholding same-sex marriage, as he emphasized that the country was “not culturally ready for it.” “Culturally, our values may conflict with many of the values that they want to impose on us… Culturally, we are not ready for that. That’s what we believe, unless somebody argues otherwise. That’s our position right now,” he said. ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Albay Gov. Noel E. Rosal has asked the Supreme Court (SC) to stop the Commission on Elections (Comelec) from implementing a resolution that disqualified him from the top provincial post. In a petition filed on Nov. 21, Rosal asked the SC to issue a status quo ante order (SQAO) or a temporary restraining order (TRO) to stop the enforcement of the Comelec’s resolution issued on Nov. 18. In a decision handed down by the Comelec’s first division last Sept. 19, Rosal was found to have violated Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) on the 45-day spending ban in the May 9, 2022 elections.The complaint against Rosal was filed by Joseph San Juan Armogila who was named as respondent, together with the Comelec, in the SC petition. Rosal’s appeal before the Comelec en banc (full commission membership) was denied last Nov. 18. He then filed a petition with the SC which was denominated as GR No. 264125. A copy of the petition was not available as of posting. In a press statement, Rosal’s camp alleged that the Comelec deprived the governor of his “constitutional right to due process” after the poll body denied his motion to reset “hearing on the preliminary conference despite justifiable grounds.” Rosal’s camp also said that the poll body had issued the disqualification ruling based on “mere allegations” and despite the failure of Armogila to “adduce evidence” that the governor had actually disbursed funds during a period specified by the Omnibus Election Code. It said that Rosal asked the SC to determine a possible “grave abuse of discretion” on the part of the Comelec when the it issued the challenged decision and resolution. In a statement issued on Nov. 18, Comelec Spokesperson John Rex Laudiangco said that Rosal cannot yet be removed from office and implement the disqualification without a Certificate of Finality and a Writ of Execution. “The (Comelec) en banc’s decision is final, but has yet to become final and executory. Governor Rosal may elevate the matter to the SC via a seasonably filed petition for certiorari,” Laudiangco said. “The Comelec en banc’s decision becomes final and executory either via a final decision of the SC, or the aggrieved party’s failure to seasonably file a petition for certiorari,” he added.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Ten men posing as National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents were arrested for serious illegal detention and attempted robbery charges filed by a resident of the exclusive Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa on Nov. 22. Brig. Gen. Kirby John Kraft, Southern Police District (SPD), said the 10 suspects are also facing charges of usurpation of authority and trespass to dwelling. The arrested suspects were identified as David Tan Liao, 46, travel agency agent; Fritz Ian Petil Cafino, 33, and Ronaldo Cadalena Zuniega, 33, both utility personnel of Long-Shang Travel Agency; Andy Ko Sy, 50 driver and translator; Erlindo Cuago Auditor, 48, tricycle driver; Roderick Segundo Ensano, 48, taxi driver; Bienvinido Biolango Vildad Jr., 47, driver; Ernesto Solamillo Baay, 45, driver; Roberto Daradar Pacis, 65, messenger; and Jonathan Caliwag Salud, 46, immigration officer.The police are looking for Jose Romel Herbolingo Congreso, 50, and four other unidentified suspects. According to the police, the detention and attempted robbery happened at about 9 a.m. inside the village. The suspects, who were on board two vehicles, entered the Madrigal Gate of Ayala Alabang Village. They informed the village guards that they would be visiting friends residing on Maria Cristina Street. Once inside the village, suspects went to the house of victim Weijian Pan, 33, a Chinese businessman, at Country Club Drive. Introducing themselves as NBI agents, the suspects allegedly threatened Erick Cai, 19, a Chinese interpreter, and forcibly opened the gate. After entering the house, suspect Liao approached the victim and demanded P40 million in exchange for his liberty. The suspects detained the victim until 7 p.m. Another victim, Juvanie Baterna Lapinig, 30, Pan’s personal driver, was able to call the village security guards and asked for help. The security guards immediately responded to the call leading to the arrest of the suspects. Kraft thanked the security guards for their prompt response and arrest of the suspects. “Suspects were presented for inquest proceedings before the City Prosecutor’s Office of Muntinlupa,” said Kraft.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Authorities are investigating the reported explosions heard on Zamora (Subi) Reef near Pagasa (Thitu) Island in Palawan moments after a China Coast Guard (CCG) seized a suspected Chinese rocket debris from the Philippine Navy (PN). Senior Undersecretary Jose Faustino Jr., officer in charge of the Department of National Defense (DND), said he is awaiting additional reports on the tense square off by a CCG vessel with bow number 5203 and a PN rubber boat near Pagasa Island last Nov. 20 which was followed by a series of loud blasts on Zamora Reef. “We stand by the accounts of our personnel in the area that, contrary to the narrative of the Chinese side, the debris being towed by a Philippine vessel to Naval Station Emilio Liwanag for inspection was rudely taken by personnel from CCGV 5203,” Faustino said on Tuesday night, Nov. 22. “Philippine authorities are also investigating the reported explosions near Pagasa Island after the incident involving the floating debris. The situation is still developing, thus, we cannot provide additional details at this time,” he added. It can be recalled that an unidentified floating debris was spotted by personnel of Naval Station Emilio Liwanag around 800 yards from Pagasa Island last Nov. 20. The Navy then retrieved the debris – a piece of metal which is believed to have come from a rocket that was launched by China recently – and towed it towards the shore. But CCG vessel 5203 blocked their path twice and deployed a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) to seize the debris. The Chinese Embassy denied the report of the Palawan-based Western Command (WESCOM) that CCG personnel forcibly took the debris from the PN personnel, saying the incident was settled after a friendly discussion. But reports said that residents of Pagasa Island heard loud blasts on Zamora Reef hours after the incident, with police saying these explosions might have come from fired artillery guns or weapons. Zamora Reef is an artificial reef built by China in the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG) or Spratly Islands. It is located around 26 km west of Pagasa Island. Faustino assured the residents of Pagasa Island and the surrounding areas in Kalayaan, Palawan that the Armed Forces of the Philippines is working with other government agencies to ensure their safety. “Events such as these are exactly why we continue to advocate for open lines of communication and dialogue mechanisms. We support the diplomatic efforts of Philippine government agencies to engage our Chinese counterparts to address the incident,” Faustino concluded.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The bilateral relations of the Philippines and United States is stronger now more than ever, according to the two countries’ defense chiefs. This was highlighted during the meeting of Senior Undersecretary Jose Faustino Jr., officer in charge of the Department of National Defense (DND), and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) Retreat and 9th ADMM-Plus in Cambodia on Tuesday, Nov. 22. “The top two officials reaffirmed the Philippines-US alliance to be on a very strong footing as manifested in the recent bilateral meeting between President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and US Vice President Kamala Harris in Manila,” said DND spokesperson Arsenio Andolong. Harris paid a courtesy call on Marcos last Monday as part of her three-day working visit to the Philippines. Marcos had said Harris’ visit was a testament to the strong ties of the two countries although he emphasized that their relationship must evolve in order to respond to the evolving and changing nature of geopolitics and regional dynamics in the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, Faustino and Austin also discussed current security outlook in the Indo-Pacific region and bilateral initiatives “to deepen further defense partnership” between the Philippines and US. This was the second time that Faustino and Austin met. On Sept, 29, the two defense ministers met in Hawaii where they reaffirmed their commitment to the ironclad alliance of their countries, and discussed ways to strengthen the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). Earlier in that same month, they also held a phone conversation where they talked about opportunities to further modernize and strengthen the two countries’ cooperation. The relationship between the Philippines and United States is perceived to be improving after it turned sour under the previous Duterte administration, which developed warm ties with China and Russia.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez on Wednesday believed there will be a time that the Philippines “will rise up” in its fight for the West Philippine Sea. While wishing it would not be tested, Romualdez said, the patience of the Filipino people is “very high” but also has “its limits.” “We have just sat by and just tried our best to talk to them to try and just simply allow our fishermen to fish,” he said in an interview with ANC. “But you know, the Filipino patience has also its limits. And I know that…one day, I hope it never happens, that the Filipino will rise up and say enough is enough,” he added, hoping this stance would be relayed to those challenging the country’s territorial rights. Currently, the Philippines has competing claims against China over the South China Sea, particularly over the West Philippine Sea. A 2016 Arbitral Tribunal Ruling rejected the Chinese so-called nine-dash claim over the disputed waters, which turned in favor of the Philippines. Romualdez’ pronouncement came as the United States, through US Vice President Kamala Harris who just left the country after a working visit, promised to stand with the Philippines in case of any armed attack on its armed forces or assets in the South China Sea. The envoy said it is “very important” for the country that the West Philippine Sea is ours. “There’s nothing that will make us move otherwise. And I think President Marcos said that very well—we will not give up one inch of our territorial waters,” he said. “And if our allies like the United States will help us, of course, we will. We not only welcome it, we are very happy with that kind of commitment coming from an ally like the United States,” he added.",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Marcos could be the next “great spokesperson” of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Wednesday. Romualdez said he noticed how the President “how articulate he can be,” which was proven by being able to end the geopolitical situation in the Indo-Pacific region. Marcos recently attended the ASEAN Summits in Cambodia, where he raised various issues, including the hot dispute on the South China Sea. “And I think that many of the leaders who have met him…are very impressed with him,” the diplomat said in an interview with ANC. “And I think you will see our Philippine President playing a major role in the community,” he added. Romualdez made what he called his presumption as he observed how Marcos is “very comfortable whenever he deals with countries in the West.” Perhaps, that was because he “was educated in the West” and “went to the United States” in his early years. So all of this gives you a feeling that our president now is very comfortable with talking to many of the…world leaders,” Romualdez said.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Supreme Court (SC) has affirmed its “full commitment and support” to end all forms of violence and discrimination against women as it kicked off its annual commemoration of the 18-day “Campaign to End Violence Against Women (VAW)” that starts on Friday, Nov. 25. In message to officials and employees, Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo said that the SC’s Committee on Gender Responsiveness in the Judiciary (CGRJ) “has been undertaking the necessary reforms mandated under several laws affecting women and children.” Some of these reforms, he said, are the promulgation of new or amendment of existing procedural rules; the establishment of family courts to handle exclusively cases involving family, child, juvenile and women victims of violence; and the adoption of policies pursuant to the Gender and Development Program. He pointed out that early this year, the SC approved the Guidelines on the Use of Gender-Fair Language in the Judiciary and Gender-Fair Courtroom Etiquette – “a product of the CGRJ’s efforts to combat sexist language in the Judiciary, by including sensitivity towards persons with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics, or SOGIESC.” He explained that the guidelines are in line with Republic Act No. 11313, the Safe Spaces Act, which prohibits and penalizes several forms of gender-based sexual harassment. “As the bastion of justice in this country, we cannot continue with indifference and apathy,” the Chief Justice said as he enjoined “the unity and cooperation not only from members of the Judiciary, but from other sectors, organizations, and civil society groups.” The yearly “Campaign to End Violence Against Women” from Nov. 25 until Dec. 12 is mandated under Proclamation 1172 issued on Nov. 17, 2006 by then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. A 2017 survey released by the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that “one in four Filipino women, aged 15-49, has experienced physical, emotional or sexual violence from husband or partner.” In a press statement issued by the SC’s public information office (PIO), Gesmundo said that “increasing access to justice is one of the pillars of the Court’s reform agenda, the Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations or SPJI, which seeks to enhance court processes and capabilities towards the delivery of responsive and real-time justice.” Through the programs envisioned in the SPJI, “we aim to make more efficient legal aid service in the hope of helping the vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the country,” he said. The CGRJ is co-chaired by SC Associate Justices Henri Jean Paul B. Inting, Jhosep Y. Lopez, and Maria Filomena D. Singh, In his message, Justice Lopez stressed the value of the theme for this year’s “End VAW Campaign — United for a VAW-Free Philippines — which “emphasizes the importance of combining individual efforts for a strong drive towards gender equality and elimination of VAW.” Lopez said “the theme encourages everyone’s participation as truly the visions of the campaign can only be achieved through responsive and active collective efforts towards a VAW-free nation.” Justice Singh, on the other hand, cited statistics that show that ‘women continue to suffer from violence despite the annual End VAW Campaign, necessitating an increased involvement from the members of the Judiciary.” “Our job is not just to adjudicate cases; it is also our job to inform others about their rights when we see that their rights are being violated and they seem not to be aware of the remedies available to them,” she said. Justice Singh urged judiciary officials and personnel: “Let us move away from the traditional way of thinking of our role in society and let us be more involved in what we see around us, in our families, in our communities, in our offices.” The PIO said that as part of the SC’s “End VAW Campaign,” a series of activities will be conducted by the Office of Administrative Services, through its Employee Training and Development Division and in coordination with the CGRJ, open to interested SC employees: Dec. 1 and 5, online trainings on RA 11313 and RA 9262, the Anti-Violence against Women and Children, respectively; Dec. 6, a webinar on “The Many Faces of Violence”; and Dec. 7, film screenings of “Walang Rape sa Bontok.”",0
Manila Bulletin,"It is high time that a single government agency is designated to chase creators and administrators of fake websites, Senator Grace Poe said. Poe made the call after joining her colleagues in raising the alarm about the proliferation of websites that dupe people into paying fees in exchange for electronic registration or arrival cards. “The e-arrival card is a relatively new document being required, at mayroon na agad mga fake website (And there are immediately fake websites),” Poe said during the plenary session on Tuesday, November 22. Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, cited duplicating functions in different government agencies. `She noted that aside from the National Bureau of Investigation’s Cybercrime Division, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) has a Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC), which was given a P274.73-million budget this year. The Philippine National Police (PNP) also has an Anti-Cybercrime Group in charge of all ICT-aided crimes. “That’s why it’s confusing, there’s no central government office that you can lodge a complaint to on particular cases like this,” Poe lamented. The lady lawmaker recalled leading a hearing on a similar issue, aimed at establishing a central complaint desk on fake websites and bank frauds. `The central government body could easily direct concerned agencies to act on the complaints based on their jurisdictions, since these fraudulent companies receive payments through credit card transactions. “Definitely, there has to be a government agency to direct those banks and credit card companies not to accept or authorize transactions from those fraudulent companies. Maybe that’s an angle we can look at,” Poe said.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a clear message to President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. when she visited Malacañang Palace: “We stand with you in defense of international rules and norms. As it relates to the South China Sea, an armed attack on the Philippines’ armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US mutual defense commitments, and that is an unwavering commitment that we have to the Philippines.” She also went to Palawan, the Philippine province closest to the South China Sea. While aboard a Philippine Navy vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, she reaffirmed the United States’ advocacy on the importance of sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom of navigation. These vital precepts in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea were cited in the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (also known as the Arbitral Tribunal) that upheld the Philippines’ position with regard to its territorial claims in the area. It will be recalled that after the meeting between President Marcos and US President Joe Biden in New York last September, the White House said in a statement: “The leaders reflected on the importance of the US-Philippines alliance. President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of the Philippines.” “Ironclad commitment” was also the term used in 2014 by former President Barack Obama with reference to setting into motion the US’ mutual defense agreement with the Philippines in case of an attack on the Philippines or on its naval assets, arising from tensions in the South China Sea. During his watch, President Donald Trump and his defense secretary Mike Pompeo forcefully declared: “The People’s Republic of China (PRC) cannot lawfully assert a maritime claim – including any Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims derived from Scarborough Reef and the Spratly Islands – vis-a-vis the Philippines in areas that the Tribunal found to be in the Philippines’ EEZ or on its continental shelf.” Included in Vice President Harris’ Manila agenda was strengthening the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in terms of identifying additional sites for basing US troops engaged in joint military exercises as well as major disaster relief and humanitarian assistance activities. Vice President Harris also conveyed the US’ readiness to cooperate with the Philippines’ initiatives to promote energy security by tapping into nuclear power options. She observed that the two countries’ “multi-faceted” bilateral relations have expanded in scope within the context of Indo-Pacific economic prosperity. While the Philippines is keen on tapping into opportunities for expanded trade and investments in the post-pandemic era, it continues to be hobbled by the destructive impact of global warming and climate change. Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who served as President Biden’s official emissary during the Marcos inaugural last June, joined Vice President Harris in her Manila visit. In a Healthy and Safe Back to School event hosted by USAID at the Gregoria De Jesus Elementary School in Caloocan City, he announced that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will be providing $5 million to accelerate the country’s vaccine rollout. Philippine-American diplomatic relations have been strengthened considerably by Vice President Harris’ highly productive working visit.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Pope Francis has ordered the removal of all Caritas Internationalis leaders, including Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle as president, and appointed a commissioner to run the Catholic Church’s worldwide charity arm until new officers are elected. “It would appear necessary to revise the current regulatory framework to make it more appropriate to the statutory functions of the organization, and to prepare it for the elections to be held at the next General Assembly. With the fervent wish to facilitate the envisaged renewal of the Institution,” the Decree dated Nov. 11 read. The Vatican made the announcement on Tuesday, Nov. 22. The Pontiff removed from office all the executives of Caritas Internationalis (CI), a Vatican-based confederation of 162 Catholic relief, development, and social services organizations working in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Founded in 1951, CI, the Vatican said, has more than a million staff and volunteers around the world. A report by the Catholic News Agency said an independent review found deficiencies in Caritas Internationalis’ “management and procedures, seriously prejudicing team-spirit and staff morale.” The next general assembly, where the new officers are elected for a four-year term, is scheduled for May 2023. In the meantime, Pope Francis has appointed Pier Francesco Pinelli as Temporary Administrator (Commissario straordinario in the original Decree) of Caritas Internationalis. The Holy Father also appointed Maria Amparo Alonso Escobar and Rev. P. Manuel Morujão, S.J., as support to Pinelli “for the personal and spiritual accompaniment of the employees,” the decree said. Cardinal Tagle, the CNA said, will be assisting Pinelli in preparation for the general assembly next year. The Filipino cardinal was first elected to head Caritas Internationalis in 2015, making him the first president from Asia. He was reelected in 2019 and was supposed to end his term in 2023.",0
Manila Bulletin,"Several alternatives to single-use plastics are being looked for by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in collaboration with other government organizations as it adopts a whole-of-government approach in its search. According to DOST, studies show that plastics continue to be a pervasive material in the country, being a “sachet economy” that utilizes the “tingi” retail system employed in the market. Plastic is mainly used in grocery stores, as packaging material, in construction, and a lot more due to it being cheap, strong, and extremely versatile. In connection with the end of single-plastic use, the Industrial Technology and Development Institute (ITDI) of the DOST will conduct a technology forum on “Analyzing the Life Cycle of Non-Environmentally Acceptable Products on Wednesday, Nov. 22.

In a privilege speech delivered on Tuesday, Atayde lamented that members of the House of Representatives “are intimately familiar with this problem” as the House “has suspended work in the past because of widespread flooding in the metropolis.” “Mukhang napapanahon na para mag designate ng isang opisyal mula sa Ehekutibo na tututok sa flood control projects,” suggested Atayde. “By designating a “Flooding Czar” in the Cabinet, someone will be primarily responsible for ensuring proper coordination between the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Metro Manila Development Authority, and NCR’s various local governments with regard to flood control projects,” said the solon. Atayde explained that one of the priorities of the government should be to fast track the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank-funded Metro Manila Flood Management Project, which despite being approved in 2017 appeared to be facing delays based on project indicators. For example, out of the 36 pumping stations that need to be rehabilitated, only one has been rehabilitated as of Oct. 31, 2021. The project likewise targets the construction of 20 new pumping stations by the end of November 2024, and none has been completed as of the end of October 2021. The freshman legislator also urged the DPWH to allocate funds in order to conduct a study that will determine the feasibility of possible solutions to address the flooding problem. This includes (1) the construction of retarding ponds in malls, basketball courts, playgrounds, parks, and other open spaces, as well as box culverts under our roads––measures that are implemented in other countries like Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore; (2) the relocation of informal settlers where retarding ponds will be constructed; (3) the construction of high rise walls and pumping stations at the San Juan River; and (4) the assessment of the master plan for flood control of Metro Manila and surrounding areas. According to Atayde, in his first month as the representative of the first district, “thunderstorms and heavy rains caused sudden flooding in several barangays in my district.” “In Barangay Mariblo, Barangay Sto. Domingo and Barangay Talayan, residents experienced waist-deep floods. Sa mga barangays sa Bungad, San Antonio, Katipunan at Damayan naman, hanggang tuhod ang baha. Dun sa West Riverside sa Barangay Del Monte, hindi na makalabas ang mga tao sa kani-kanilang bahay dahil sa tindi ng baha,” shared Atayde. “Many roads in my district were impassable, which made it impossible for families to go out and buy food and other basic necessities. Ganun kalala, Mr. Speaker.” “The damage caused by floods in the whole country, not just Metro Manila, is substantial,” the lawmaker stressed. Atayde cited data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, which reported that the total cost of damage due to natural extreme events and disasters that hit the country in 2021 was 60.7 billion pesos, 27% higher than in 2020, when the damage cost the country 47.8 billion pesos. The GHD report “Aquanomics: The economics of water risk and future resilience,” on the other hand, said floods and tropical storms striking the country could result in losses amounting to 89 billion US dollars between 2022 and 2050. “At the current exchange rate,” Atayde pointed out, “that is equivalent to 5.1 trillion pesos.”",0
Manila Bulletin,"Alternergy Holdings Corporation, a Filipino-led pioneer renewable energy (RE) company via its subsidiary Pililla AVPC Corporation (PACO) and Shell Overseas Investment B.V. have formally sealed their “investment marriage” for prospective offshore wind farm development at the Calavite Passage in Mindoro. Alternergy Chairman and former Energy Secretary Vincent S. Perez indicated that the take-off point of this trailblazing tie-up will be on measuring the commercially-viable potential of their awarded service contract plus undertaking feasibility study that will eventually merit final investment decision (FID) on the project. Under the current partnership agreement, 60-percent equity in the Mindoro offshore wind venture is placed under Alternegy’s charge and Shell for the balance of 40 percent.When asked if there will be changes in the shareholder-arrangement between the partner-firms following the Philippine government’s issuance of a policy allowing 100-percent foreign ownership on RE projects, Joe Nai, general manager for Offshore Power Asia Pacific-Renewables and Energy Solutions, noted that their priority at this point will be to gauge first the prospective capacity generation of their initial offshore wind farm development in Mindoro. Alternergy, in particular, emphasized that their partnership “has obtained a wind energy service contract (WESC) from the Department of Energy to assess the feasibility of an offshore wind project in the wind-swept Calavite passage near Mindoro. ”Currently we don’t have final investment decision, this is still early stage,” albeit he stressed that “as development progresses, we can have the commercial decision going forward,” said Perez. He qualified that the site of their prospective offshore wind farm project as well as its neighboring blocks have colossal potential of up to 5,000 megawatts of capacity. And from that prospect, the Alternergy-Shell tandem would be looking at prospective energy generation of at least 1,000MW – and that will be the scale that they are targeting to get affirmed in the feasibility study that could be completed within five-year stretch.“That particular site in Mindoro has potential of 5.0 gigawatts. We need a large project – 1.0GW potential for that area. That’s what we will finalize as we reach final investment decision,” Perez stressed. Nai underscored that offshore wind typically has long lead time of 6 to 10 years before any project could reach commercial operations phase, but the silver lining for the industry is the maturing technology on this RE development space – that per turbine could now yield capacity of 15MW and the siting will not also be in competition with land use for the food chain. And while the duo will be advancing on their feasibility study phase, they also sounded off optimism that the government will step up collaboration on addressing the critically-needed fixes in the OSW development sphere, including those on setting up a cavernous port infrastructure facility in Mindoro that will eventually cater to the movement of goods and delivery of equipment when the targeted projects would finally reach commercial development phase. There are also other hurdles that the government via the DOE would need to address. These include the integration of offshore wind capacities into the grid; demarcating exclusion or security zones for the developed facilities; addressing dilemmas on water rights and the concerns of the fisheries sector, project financing, as well as the other environmental and social impacts. Lorelie Quiambao-Osial, country chair of Shell companies in the Philippines, asserted that as the Philippines “is moving towards a low-carbon future and offshore wind is well-positioned to support this energy transition…we will continue to support the country by providing more and cleaner energy solutions to meet the needs of our customers today and in the decades to come. ”Sarah Rose Lin, Shell’s head of Offshore Power for Philippines, further said with Alternergy’s pioneer-investor stature in the country’s RE investment milieu, “Shell looks forward to this new partnership to jointly explore the feasibility of one of the Philippines’ promising offshore wind projects. ”Onward, the newly-minted partners similarly hinted that beyond the Calavite passage prospect, they will be “looking at other offshore wind sites for possible development.”",0
Manila Bulletin,"A couple was shot dead by an unidentified assailant along the road of P-1, Barangay Dologon, Maramag, Bukidnon on Tuesday, Nov. 22. The Bukidnon Police Provincial Office identified the victims as Daniel Ocot, 60, and his wife Adelaida Ocot, 66, of Manalog, Hinunangan, Southern Leyte. The victims were aboard their Wing Van truck when they were attacked. The local police of Maramag town are reviewing all the CCTVs (closed-circuit television) installed at the said barangay, including the CCTVs of private establishments for the fast identification of the suspect. The police learned from the victim’s son that the couple was engaged in a buy-and-sell of vegetables and bananas. The Maramag police are already conducting a follow-up investigation to determine the motive of the crime. The scene of the crime operations (SOCO) recovered the two fired cartridge cases of caliber .45 inside the truck. They also recovered one keypad cellular phone, which will be turned over to Bukidnon Cyber Crime Unit for forensic examination. The victims’ cadavers were brought to the morgue while waiting for the family members to arrive. ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Every year, road crashes kill 12,000 Filipinos, Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) revealed Tuesday, November 22, during the agency’s first Road Safety Symposium. However, road-related injuries and deaths can be prevented, he underscored. “We have a shared responsibility to protect every Filipino on the road.” Road crashes are not only traumatizing, but also cause social cost and result to economic loss as there is productivity loss arising from the death, illnesses, and injuries of the victims, the DOTr Secretary maintained. Meanwhile, Swedish Ambassador to the Philippines Annika Thunborg expressed her country’s support to the Philippines in promoting road safety. “Safety, efficiency, and reliability are the hallmarks of all types of public transportation, that is why we are here today showing our support for the Philippine government in promoting road safety,” according to Ambassador Thunborg. As a tribute to the millions of victims of road crashes and recognition to emergency first responders and medical professionals, the DOTr organized the symposium as an offshoot of the National Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, Survivors, and Their Families last Sunday.

Manila Bulletin,"The city government awarded more than 30 outstanding businesses during the first Iligan Business Awards Night held at the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology gym on Nov. 15. “The event aims to celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of Iliganon entrepreneurs, businessmen, and industries for making the city better,” said City Administrator Darwin Manubag, chairperson of the Business Awards. “Your contribution to our economy is worth celebrating,” Manubag added. “This event is a dream come true not only for me as a mayor but also for all of us Iliganons,” said Mayor Frederick Siao. “It is high time for the business community to stand strong, let us share positive and inspiring stories about Iligan and the many accomplishments of the business community,” he urged. “Let us combat negativism and fake news about Iligan City and let us spread the good ‘asenso’ (success) news like the success stories of the business awardees.’’ Awardees thanked the city government for acknowledging their efforts and contribution to the economy here. Among the awards given were Best Local Coffee Shop, Best Local Milk Tea House, Best Local Restaurant, Inspiring Muslim Entrepreneur of the Year, and Inspiring Indigenous People Entrepreneur of the Year.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The United States will be providing the Philippines $7.5 million in assistance to help the country in countering illegal, unregulated, unreported and unsustainable fishing. This came as US Vice President Kamala Harris visited the fishing village of Tagburos in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, where she talked with local fishers about the impacts of such activities on their economy and on the marine ecosystem. According to a White House official, the amount will be given to the Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies not only to increase their capacity and capabilities to counter such activities, but also to “improve maritime domain awareness, and provide search and rescue support.” “Unsustainable fishing practices perpetuate a cycle of poverty and natural resource depletion,” another White House official said. The program would be done through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “USAID will support Tagburos through a multifaceted set of resilience interventions that includes IUU assessment and risk reduction planning, ensuring resilience of fish stocks, systematic marine protected area network designing, and improving fish catch through appropriate harvest controls,” the official said. The program will also boost the community’s resilience by putting in place safety nets in fishing communities. These included improving fishers’ financial literacy; establishing market linkages between fishers and government agencies, academic institutions and private sector; setting up community savings associations, and developing micro enterprises to lessen their dependence on marine resources. “The program pays special focus on women’s inclusion and empowerment so they are able to play a significant role in managing marine resources sustainably,” the official added. Other initiatives launched in the island province during Harris’ visit were the expansion of the Philippine Coast Guard’s vessel traffic management system. Through that, the agency will be led “to better maritime safety,” the fact sheet provided by the White House read. Following the Vice President’s trip, the Philippines will also start receiving near-real-time data under the Quad’s Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness initiative. “This initiative uses commercial space-based platforms to deliver a common operating picture of waterways to promote transparency and to detect and counter illicit activities,” it said.

Manila Bulletin,"The private sector has no control over the Covid-19 vaccines donated to the government, which included 70 percent of wasted vaccines from the private sector. This was reiterated by Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion on Tuesday, Nov. 22. “The majority of the wasted Covid-19 vaccines in the Philippines were not under the safekeeping of the private sector,” he said in a statement. Concepcion shared tallies of its Covid-19 vaccine inventories showing that of the total 23,516,990 doses that the private sector secured through a tripartite agreement with government and the vaccine manufacturers, 9,398,230 doses have expired. This figure includes the 2,834,495 doses it donated to local governments. The inventory, however, does not include other private sector initiatives, but Concepcion pointed out that these, too, would be under the custody of the government. According to Concepcion, the private sector has noted that there have been gaps in the government’s monitoring and reporting of the inventory, especially of the vaccines that it donated as part of the tripartite agreement. He explained that because Covid-19 vaccines are still under Emergency Use Authorization, only the government can engage in their purchase and administration, including assessing how many more it needed to buy and add to the private sector donations. The government, he added, also conducts inventory on vaccines nearing their expiry dates so that it can be used first before procuring more. Among the factors cited by the government as contributing to the wastage of the vaccines were short shelf life and temperature excursion. It also noted from its inventories that some vials were not opened or used at all. “Private sector has always been proactive in pushing for vaccinations,” said Concepcion. “In fact we were the ones asking the HTAC (Health Technology Assessment Council) to adopt the US FDA guidelines just so we can speed up the booster vaccinations,” he said. In July, millions of Covid-19 vaccines worth billions of pesos expired just days after second boosters were allowed for adults 50 years and older, and those 18 to 49 years with comorbidities. “There are clearly several gaps that led to the expiry of the vaccines,” Concepcion said. “Some of those gaps we tried to point out, such as the need to listen to the science coming from abroad, and to act swiftly considering that our economy is on the line,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience and lay down clear guidelines for vaccinations,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"An infectious disease expert reminded the public to remain vigilant against fake medicines as this may cause an adverse effect on one’s health. “Ang magiging epekto niyan sa katawan talagang hindi maganda. So, kailangan talaga natin na suriin (The effect of that on the body is not good. So, we really need to check),” said infectious disease expert Dr. Rontgene Solante during a public briefing on Tuesday, Nov. 22. “Unang-una hindi natin alam kung mas mataas ang mga adverse reaction or reaction ng mga gamot na ‘to dahil hindi natin alam kung ano ang quality (First of all, we don’t know the possible adverse reactions that can happen [if you take these] drugs because we don’t know its quality),” he added. Solante advised the public to only purchase medicines from “authorized and reputable drug stores.” He urged the public to be extra cautious when buying medicines online. “More importantly siguro we discourage online unless the online site na iyan ay authorized government or private na mga healthcare delivery drugs or drug stores (we discourage the online purchase [of medicines] unless the online site is authorized by the government or these are private healthcare delivery drugs or drug stores),” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Health (DOH) said more than 137,000 infants in Metro Manila were vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) during its 10-day catch-up immunization drive. A total of 137,701 infants aged zero to 12 months were vaccinated against VPDs such as polio, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis B, and human papilloma virus (HPV). This was part of the “Vax-Baby-Vax” campaign that was launched by DOH-Metro Manila Center for Health Development (CHD) last Nov. 17. “With only an original total target of 137,000 infants in the region, the DOH exceeded its target after inoculating an additional 701 infants, bringing the total coverage rate to 100.48 percent,” the DOH said in a statement on Tuesday, Nov. 22. “We are very proud of this achievement not because we exceeded our target, but because having done so means that we were successful in protecting our children against debilitating but easily-preventable diseases,” the DOH said. The top three cities with the highest coverage rates “relative to their respective target populations” are Manila with 28,073 or 130 percent; Quezon City with 23,732 or 129 percent; and Parañaque City with 10,803 or 122 percent, the DOH said. With this, the DOH said “it will strive to achieve the same, or even better results, in other areas, considering the relatively low immunization coverage in other regions of the country as well.” Around 1.4 million Filipino children born during the Covid-19 pandemic have yet to receive a single routine vaccine dose, the DOH said. DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire urged parents to get their children vaccinated against VPDs. “Ang paalala lamang po natin sa ating mga magulang: hindi pa huli ang lahat para pabakunahan ang ating mga anak (We are reminding parents that it’s not yet too late to have your children vaccinated),” she said. “Huwag na po nating hintayin na magkasakit sila at magsisi tayo, ngayon pa lang ay ibigay na natin sa kanila ang proteksyon na kailangan nila upang mabigyan natin sila ng malusog at matiwasay na buhay habang sila ay tumatanda (Let’s not wait for them to get sick.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. told the country’s career executive service officers and eligibles to be on the lookout for corruption as they try to reinvent the bureaucracy. Speaking at the 49th founding anniversary of the Career Executive Service Board (CESB) and 2022 Career Executive Service Lifelong Learning for Leadership Congress on Tuesday, Nov. 22, Marcos urged the government executives to help him reinvent bureaucracy and to actively take part in pursuing the administration’s 8-point socioeconomic agenda. The 8-point socioeconomic agenda involves “policies that promote social justice, ensure food security, accelerate progress, protect our environment and address climate change.” He then pointed out the need to remain vigilant over “temptations and corruption” in the government. “Remember that we are here not for our own gain. We are here to bring forth a government that provides for the needs of the people,” he said, stressing that the “welfare of the people and the improvement of our lives is of utmost importance.” “Most importantly, let us be vigilant against temptation and corruption and other acts that diminish the public trust,” he further said. The chief executive also assured the government officials to carry out a review of Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2022, affecting the CESB. “Let me assure our Career Executive Service Board and the affected CESEs occupying third-level positions in the government that the Office of the President is going to review the said memorandum, and look into the other hurdles faced by many CESEs (career executive service eligibles) in obtaining CES eligibility,” Marcos said. He also challenged them to learn from each other and utilize the invaluable learning and best practices highlighted in the congress towards effecting change.  ",0
The Manila Times,"DEPARTMENT of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Amenah Pangandaman on Monday stressed the need for Philippines prioritize digitalization across all sectors, industries, as well as branches and processes in the goverment. Speaking at the Pilipinas Conference 2022, Pangandaman highlighted the ""crucial"" role of digitalization in the country's post-pandemic recovery. ""This is crucial as greater collaboration and innovation on public service delivery is even more pronounced now as the public demands for a more responsive government—quick to deliver as we cushion the unprecedented impacts of the pandemic,"" she said. The Philippines ranking in the IMD World Digital Competitiveness improved two places higher from 58th to 56th out of 63 countries this year. However, Pangandaman lamented that the country remains behind compared to its peers in the Asia-Pacific with a score of 52.81 out of 100. ""This dictates the need for our country to fully embrace and transition to digitalization, especially on government processes and business models,"" the DBM chief said. According to Pangandaman, the government will also push investments on innovations to close the digital governance gap in order to achieve efficiency across the government and enhance the country's digital economy. ""To achieve equitable participation in the digital society and bridge the widening digital divide, the government must make meaningful digital opportunities available for all—beyond basic connectivity. By investing in digitalization, we connect Filipinos to more opportunities,"" she stated. Under the proposed 2023 budget, P12.47 billion will be provided for information and communications technology (ICT) and digitalization programs and projects of the government. Additionally, the DBM secretary noted that her department will continue to advocate digitalization throughout the Public Financial Management process, along with the Department of Finance, Bureau of the Treasury, and Commission on Audit. ""This will improve our data governance by generating real-time, accurate and vital financial information which will aid government managers to make timely and data-driven decisions. This will result in better cash management, effective financial control, accountability, and oversight with financial management systems integration across the bureaucracy,"" said Pangandaman.   ",0
The Manila Times,"UNITED States Vice President Kamala Harris announced on Tuesday that the US will provide additional funding to support the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and other Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies. Vice President Harris made the announcement on board BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) that was docked at Puerto Princesa Port in Palawan. According to Harris, the additional funding will increase the concerned agencies' capacity to counter Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing; enhance their monitoring systems; and upgrade their equipment. ""To the PCG, you are on the frontline of standing up for international rules-based order,"" Harris said in her remarks. ""Each and every day, as you patrol these waters, you uphold the rules and norms that are vital to the prosperity of the Filipino people and people around the world,"" Harris said.

The Manila Times,"THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) reiterated its commitment in its peace and order initiatives following the surrender of 50 Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) insurgents in Sultan Kudarat. Interior Secretary Benjamin ""Benhur"" Abalos Jr. said that the agency's commitment entails the promise of extending government support to former violent extremists (FVE) under the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program or E-Clip. ""The government under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. remains committed to its peace and order initiatives. We will work on that. And now, with 50 FVE here in Sultan Kudarat, I am happy that you have chosen the path of peace,"" Abalos said in a statement on Monday. ""Expect your government to support you as you return to your families and society,"" he added. Abalos said that all 50 surrenderers, upon proper documentation, can be eligible to receive government support under the E-Clip initiative. He said the DILG field office in Sultan Kudarat is in continuous coordination with the local government unit (LGU) to ensure that the surrenderers will be granted support as they join the mainstream society. The DILG chief stressed that by surfacing and returning to the folds of the law to become productive citizens of the society, the former rebels can take advantage of E-Clip's assistance that covers livelihood, education, housing, medical assistance, monetary remuneration for each firearm surrendered, and other social services crucial to their reintegration into society. ""We thank our FVEs who decided to leave their lives full of violence and return to their families to be a productive part of society. We are with you on this path,"" he said. He likewise said that under the E-Clip initiative, some 611 former insurgents and their families have received P45.79 million in financial and livelihood assistance since July 2022. According to the report of DILG in Soccsksargen, 47 of said FVEs received a collective amount of P540,000 where 15 received P20,000 each; 16 FVEs with P10,000 each; and, 16 received P5,000 each from the Provincial Government of Sultan Kudarat under the ""Kakep Ka Su Kalilintad"" or ""Embracing the Peace"" campaign. Three of the surrenderers were not able to attend the event. ""We thank the Sultan Kudarat provincial government for extending their assistance to our FVEs. Next is the help from the government through E-Clip."" The provincial government likewise handed 47 food packs that included rice, assorted canned goods, and instant noodles. Abalos said all necessary steps for the inclusion of surrenderees as recipients of E-Clip are now being undertaken. He likewise said close monitoring will be conducted to ensure proper utilization of government livelihood and financial assistance. The DILG in Soccsksargen said the 50 former insurgents surrendered following a police operation of the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Police-Provincial Intelligence Unit under the supervision of Col. Christopher Bermudez and led by LtCol. Bryan Bernardino. The former extremists likewise surrendered to the Philippine National Police numerous assorted high-powered firearms and one crew-served weapon or mortar and improvised explosive devices. They have been tagged and tied to the various bombing incidents in various places and attacks against police or military detachments in the region. Abalos was joined by Sultan Kudarat Gov. Datu Pax Ali Mangudadatu, Ilocos Regional Police Director BGen. Jimili Macaraeg, DILG-Soccsksargen Regional Director Josephine Cabrido-Leysa, and the local chief executives of all the Sultan Kudarat towns. Former governor Suharto Mangudadatu, Maguindanao Gov.

The Manila Times,"ALREADY a respondent in the killing of a popular broadcaster, suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) chief Gerald Bantag is facing another case, this time in connection with a joint venture agreement for the commercial development of the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said on Monday his staff is looking into the deal Bantag made with ATOM, the land developer responsible for the unexplained diggings discovered inside the sprawling NBP compound. Bantag and his deputy at BuCor, Ricardo Zulueta, are prime suspects in the slaying of Percival ""Percy Lapid"" Mabasa and NBP inmate Jun Villamor, the alleged middleman in the Lapid case. ""I already asked my staff to study all possible cases,"" Remulla said in a press briefing. ""The giant swimming pool was not in the budget of the BuCor. Who is funding it? We'll have my staff study all possible violation of laws,"" he said. Remulla said that Bantag submitted the plan to develop the NBP to then-president Rodrigo Duterte under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Law. ""Definitely, there is a process to be followed when you want joint venture on government property. Apparently, it was not followed. For ATOM to remain in the premises and participate in the digging is another matter,"" he said. Bantag claimed that the deal with ATOM was a ""win-win"" situation, since the firm will donate a 234-hectare property in General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, as the site for a new national penitentiary, in exchange for the development of the present NBP. Bantag said the BuCor will also get 35 percent of the earnings in the development of the Bilibid property. Remulla said documents show that the project was rejected by former Justice secretary and now Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, who also recommended its disapproval to Duterte. Because the project falls under the BOT Law, it requires presidential approval. Remulla admitted that Bantag had told him about the project but never submitted supporting papers or documents. ""The DoJ is not project bound. We want proactive measures to improve the [prison] system. Lipat mo lang 'yan (If you just transfer it), without improving anything, there would be the same problem,"" he said. On Monday, Bantag received a copy of the subpoena in the Mabasa and Villamor cases, two days before the preliminary investigation was to start. Bantag's lawyer Rocky Thomas Balisong went to the DoJ office to get a copy of the subpoena. Balisong said his client is determined to face the allegations against him. He met with Bantag in Baguio City over the weekend to discuss their legal strategy. The subpoena compels Bantag to appear at the DoJ building in Manila on November 23 and December 5. He must submit his counter-affidavit to be sworn before the DoJ panel handling the case made up of Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Charlie Guhit, Deputy State Prosecutor Olivia Laroza-Torrevillas and Senior Assistant Prosecutor Josie Christina Dugay. The subpoena was first served at Bantag's last known address in Caloocan City on November 15, but no one was around to receive it. Remulla, meanwhile, refused to believe reports that Zulueta is dead. ""I had information a week ago on where he was at least,"" he said. Zulueta allegedly received orders from Bantag to seek the help of gang leaders imprisoned at the NBP in arranging the murder of Mabasa and Villamor.  ",0

The Manila Times,"WITH a unanimous vote, the bicameral Commission on Appointments (CA) on Tuesday confirmed the interim appointment of Manuel Bonoan as Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The committee on public works and highways had deliberated and recommended for plenary confirmation Bonoan's interim appointment. During the panel's deliberations, Sen. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go conveyed his full support for the ad interim appointment of Bonoan as Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways. ""Secretary Bonoan is no stranger to the department, having first served in government as assistant secretary in the DPWH during the administration of former president Fidel Ramos,"" noted Go. ""In the private sector, Secretary Bonoan was responsible for many important projects, notably the Skyway, the NAIA Expressway, the South Luzon Expressway, and the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway, among others,"" he said. Sen. Cynthia Villar urged nominee Manuel Bonoan to look into the right-of-way problems hounding government infrastructure projects once his appointment as Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) secretary is confirmed. Villar pointed out that right-of-way issues had constantly delayed the completion of some government infrastructure projects, citing the case of the Cavite-Laguna Expressway (CALAX) as an example. ""Maybe you should look into it so that we can implement the CALAX because its completion has been delayed... I hope the DPWH would realize that if you don't interfere in the right-of-way problem... then our infrastructure problems would be delayed,"" Villar said. Sen. Francis ""Tol"" Tolentino expressed confidence that Manuel Bonoan will be a good secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). Tolentino said he started his career at the DPWH as a civil engineering aid in 1966 and has worked his way up to becoming a senior undersecretary in 2010. ""I would like to express and convey my full support to the confirmation of Sec.[retary] Manuel Bonoan as secretary of the DPWH. I believe that he will be a good DPWH secretary,"" Tolentino said. Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Victor ""JV"" Ejercito, called on Bonoan to prioritize high impact projects to stimulate economic growth. Ejercito cited the flooding in a barangay in San Juan City which he said could have been prevented by the rehabilitation of the drainage system, construction of flood control, among others. ""I hope that with your leadership, with your integrity, this will not happen again. And I know you can do it,"" Ejercito said. Sen. Maria Imelda Josefa ""Imee"" Marcos questioned the P32 million receivables reflected in his s Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) dated June 30, 2022. Bonoan said that most of the amount was unpaid pension for his retirement from private practice in San Miguel Corporation while the other was from private business. Marcos put the issue at rest as she expressed belief in the fitness of the nominee to the post. ""While some have troubles with unexplained wealth, in the case of Secretary Bonoan, we joke in Ilocos Norte that he has unexplained poverty. I think that he is fit for the job in more ways than one, highly qualified,"" Marcos said.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Philippine government will be sending a note verbale to China following the confrontation between Filipino and Chinese sea patrollers near Pag-asa Island, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos said Tuesday. ""Yes, I think that's what we need to do,"" the President said in a chance interview at the sidelines of the 49th Founding Anniversary of Career Executive Service Board (CESB) celebration in Pasay City. According to the President, this is to resolve the conflicting reports of authorities from both countries. ""When it was first reported to me by the (Armed Forces of the Philippines) chief of staff, I asked him to immediately call his – the Philippine – the military attaché in the Chinese Embassy and to get a report,"" he stated. ""And hindi nagtugma 'yung report ng Philippine Navy at saka 'yung report na galing sa China because the word forcibly was used in the Navy – in the Philippine Navy report. And that was not the characterization in the Chinese navy report or the report coming from China. So, we have to now ask the Chinese, why is it that their account is so different and it's much more benign — shall we use that word? Because the word forcibly na nga was used in the — at least in the initial reports of the Philippine Navy,"" he added. The diplomatic communication stemmed from the alleged seizure by the Chinese coast guard of rocket debris recovered near Pag-asa Island by Filipino personnel last weekend. Beijing confirmed the object was part of a rocket that it recently launched but denied that it was ""forcefully"" taken away and insisted that what transpired was a ""friendly consultation"".  ",0
The Manila Times,"NATIONAL Security Adviser Clarita Carlos on Tuesday said she recommended to President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., to file a note verbale against Beijing, following an incident involving a Chinese coast guard and a Philippine naval station team near the Pagasa Island in the West Philippine Sea. In a radio interview, Secretary Carlos said she can only make public the note verbale but not the others. Perhaps what I can disclose to the public to what I recommended was the thing that we always do and that is to file a note verbale to China. The said recommendation comes on the heels of the meeting between President Marcos and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asean Summit in Cambodia. ",0
The Manila Times,"FORMER Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez has been expelled from the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP) for ""party disloyalty"" and ""acts inimical to the party."" The party's decision stemmed from a complaint filed before the PFP leadership by Jammal ""Bong"" Amin, PFP regional chairman for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), Al-Rasheed Sakkalahul (PFP BARMM regional president), and Edifar ""Papay"" Ladjhali (PFP BARMM regional executive vice president) alleging that Rodriguez has violated the party's platform of the government of fixing the government and making the country ""crime-free, drug-free, corruption-free, insurgency-free and poverty-free."" Rodriguez was the chief of staff and spokesman for Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. during his presidential campaign. The complaint enumerated several instances when he purportedly used his influence as executive secretary to promote the appointment of General Manager Christopher Pastrana to the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA). The appointment was considered ""highly questionable"" because aside from ""conflict of interest,"" Pastrana, one of the owners of Archipelago Philippines Ferries, or FastCat, still owes the Department of Transportation (DoTr) P132 million. Had Pastrana been appointed, the money he owed the DoTr would have been ""cleared,"" the complainants said. Pastrana heading the PPA ""will be a clear case of conflict of interest"" since Rodriguez's wife, Meann, is related to a certain Dennis Trajano, APFF chairman, who also happens to be Pastrana's business partner. The complaint also said Rodriguez ""still attempted to clutch at straws"" after he submitted to the President a ""Special/Memorandum Order creating the Office of the Presidential Chief of Staff. The order was criticized by former Senate president and now Chief Presidential Legal Adviser Juan Ponce Enrile, who said that such an office will have extraordinary powers that overlapped with the duties and responsibilities of the Presidential Management Staff, Office of the Solicitor General, Office of the Executive Secretary, and other offices attached to the Office of the President. ""If he wanted less stress and conflict, he shouldn't have done this Draft MO or SO,"" the complainants said, referring to Rodriguez's memorandum. ""In the 77 days that he was in office, Rodriguez's tenure was marked by chaos, confusion, disorder, intrigue, instability, nepotism, charges of appointments-for-sale, 'empire building' and plotting against his perceived detractors,"" they alleged. ""His first executive order, firing some 4,000 government employees without providing for their replacements, was a disaster. What followed was confusion and paralysis in government service."" The PFP Arbitration and Executive Committee said it found Rodriguez ""guilty of breach or loss of trust and confidence, abandonment, disloyalty, and acts inimical to the party."" ""The President took no part in this decision, but was informed of this disciplinary action of the Party against respondent, and he (the President) offered no objection,"" the PFP said in its resolution. Rodriguez also took no part in the decision ""because of our rule: once a member of the Executive Committee is a party to a case, he is motu propio inhibited from participating in the resolution of this conflict,"" it said. Rodriguez's old position in the party, executive vice president, has been passed on to Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo. Lagdameo's former post as PFP national treasurer has been given to Antonio Marfori.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez has defended President Marcos’ foreign trips by saying “travelling for a leader is a must.” Asked about his comment on the President’s remark that he was “travelling too much,” the senior diplomat believed it is just imperative for Marcos to make trips “because diplomacy is conducted in person. “Even I, during the COVID, I still had to go around and take my chances, because that’s the only way,” Romualdez said in an interview with ANC as he noted that the President himself “doesn’t want to travel.” Besides, there was also another president who travelled a lot, Romualdez added. “You have to do it diplomacy in person. And our president needs to do that. We’ve told him that there are some commitments or some travel commitments that he really cannot avoid,” he said. Romualdez also said the President is expected to make another trip to the United States, a country his administration is currently trying to strengthen alliance with.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos on Tuesday debunked rumors that Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno was on his way out and that Albay Rep. Joey Salceda would replace him. “[That’s] fake news. I don’t know where it comes from. Why would I do that? We have assembled a great [economic] team,” Mr. Marcos told reporters in a brief interview at the sidelines of the 49th founding anniversary of the Career Executive Service Board at the Philippine International Convention Center where he was the guest of honor. “Moreover, we’re trying to go down a certain direction. It’s a very, very poor time to, as they say, change horses in midstream,” the President added. Diokno himself denied there were moves to ease him out as finance secretary, downplaying stories that he will be replaced by Salceda. “I don’t know where this is coming from. I’m old enough in this game to even bother about. I just work nonstop, unceasingly to do my job.

Manila Bulletin,"President Marcos and Caloocan City Mayor Dale Gonzalo “Along” Malapitan led the city’s commemoration of the 159th birth anniversary of one of the country’s heroes, Andres Bonifacio. “Makasaysayan ang ating lungsod dahil nagsilbi itong kanlungan ng ating mga kababayang lumaban upang makamit ang Kalayaan, isa na rito si Gat Andres Bonifacio na nagpasiklab ng rebolusyon laban sa mga mananakop na dayuhan (Our city is historic because it served as a refuge for our countrymen who fought to achieve freedom, one of whom was Gat Andres Bonifacio who ignited a revolution against foreign invaders),” Malapitan said. “Mapalad po tayo, dahil sa ating mga bayani, tinatamasa natin ang tamis ng kalayaan. Kaya naman ngayong makabagong panahon, tayo’y tumindig at pairalin ang kabayanihan sa ating kapwa tungo sa pagbuo ng mas maunlad na lungsod at bansa para sa mga susunod pang henerasyon (We are blessed because our heroes fought for the freedom that we are enjoying today. That’s why in this modern age, let’s stand and let heroism prevail for our people to build a more prosperous city and country for future generations),” he added. The president led the wreath-laying ceremony at the Andres Bonifacio National Monument in the city. Senators Robin Padilla, Sherwin Gatchalian, Manuel “Lito” Lapid, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora, Malabon City Mayor Jeannie Sandoval, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Caloocan City District 1 Representative Oscar G. Malapitan, National Historical Commission of the Philippines Chairman Rene Escalante, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.

Andres Bonifacio, known as the founder of the Katipunan, a secret society founded in 1892 that aimed to fight for the freedom of the country from Spanish rule, was born on Nov. 30, 1863. Bonifacio’s birthday was declared as an official national holiday under Republic Act No. 2946, s. 1921, according to officialgazette.gov.ph.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has called on Filipinos to be “dutiful and law-abiding” citizens as the nation celebrates the 159th birth anniversary of Andres Bonifacio. “I call on my fellow Filipinos to honor Bonifacio’s life of extraordinary selflessness by becoming dutiful and law-abiding citizens who will contribute towards a brighter and freer future for all Filipinos,” Marcos said in a statement Wednesday, Nov. 30. He also told the citizenry to remain vigilant in protecting the country from “social ills and other elements that threaten our liberties.” Marcos paid tribute to the father of the Philippine revolution, saying it was through his bold idea that our ancestors were able to muster the will and the courage to fight their oppressors, “paving the way to our motherland’s eventual emancipation.” “Indeed, it was his deeds that provided the impetus for our collective liberation, which we are challenged to preserve and protect amidst these trying times,” he said. The President led the commemoration of Bonifacio Day in Caloocan City, where he encouraged the nation to emulate Bonifacio’s courage in overcoming the challenges of modern times. “Habang patuloy tayong nakikibaka sa mga hamon ng modernong panahon, nawa’y maging halimbawa si Bonifacio at ang ating mga bayani, noon at ngayon, upang mag-tagumpay tayo sa ating mga hangarin (While we go through the challenges of modern times, may the example of Bonifacio and other heroes then and now to succeed in our dreams),” Marcos said. The chief executive also urged Filipinos to be better version of themselves and be a Filipino whose loyalty and love for the country is like that of Bonifacio. He also encouraged the nation to continue honoring Bonifacio and all other Filipino heroes, “known or not”, to ensure the country’s freedom and identity. “Ang kanyang pangalan ay mananatiling naka-ukit sa ating kasaysayan kailanman, hindi lamang dahil sa kanyang pamumuno sa rebolusyon kundi sa kanyang ‘di matatawarang tapang at pagmamahal sa bayan (His name will remain engraved in our history, not only for leading the revolution but for his unconditional bravery and love for the country),” Marcos said. “Bilang mga tagapagmana ng kalayaang kanilang ipinaglaban, tungkulin natin bilang mga Pilipino na panatilihing buhay ang diwa ng kanilang mga layunin at siguruhing mapayapa, malaya, at masagana ang ating sambayanan (As inheritors of the freedom they fought for, it is our duty as Filipinos to keep the spirit of their objectives alive and ensure a peaceful, free, and abundant nation),” Marcos added.

Manila Bulletin,"Former vice president Leni Robredo on Tuesday, Nov. 29, enjoined international and local foundations and civic society movements to fight disinformation in the Philippines, which she described as a “ground zero” for fake news and influence operations. Speaking before the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung Solutions Conference, which was attended also by the Stratbase ADR Institute, Robredo expressed hope for everyone to address the root cause of disinformation and expose those who benefit from it.  “So ang wish ko (my wish is), that this conference will result [in] that: all of us agreeing that this is a problem shared by everyone, no matter our political color, and we should all work together to combat what we already have,” she told the audience. And while fact-checking is necessary, Robredo lamented it as “inadequate.” “Instead of engaging in hyper-politicized debates about individual issues, lies, and myths, we must pull back and situate each lie within the bigger process of disinformation—we must expose, so to speak, how the sausage is made, and talk about who is benefiting from disinformation, who is benefiting in every story, in every lie that is being said, and what is the agendas, what are the motivations,” she said. She offered solutions, which are grounded in the best practices of other countries, to the issue: Taiwan’s “Fast, Fair, and Fun” strategy; Maria Ressa’s suggestion to view disinformation as having an impact on human rights and protect data privacy and banning the surveillance advertising; and reforming social media platforms. The former vice president, who lost the 2022 presidential elections, is in a short vacation in the Philippines after spending months in the United States to attend speaking engagements in Harvard University, where she was one of the Hauser Leaders, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Democracy Forum of the Obama Foundation. She was also recently in Zurich to speak at a conference hosted by the Asia Society Switzerland. She will fly back to the United States on Friday, Dec. 2, to deliver a series of talks—at the Asia Society New York, The HOW Institute in New York, Princeton University, Tufts University, Northeastern University, and Bentley University. Cornell University and Georgetown University have also extended invitations to her, but she is yet to confirm if these will fit her schedule. “And the reason why I’m telling you this is that these invitations are a clear indication that the eyes of many around the world are on the Philippines,” Robredo said. “Those whom we have engaged have shown particular interest in disinformation and influence operations in the Philippines. We are, after all, considered—unfortunately—ground zero for such a phenomena,” she added. The former official shared that the Philippines is considered a “petri dish” for “those who weaponized social media to spread lies, control the flow of information, erode our trust in each other and in our institutions, polarize society, and dismantle the structures for meaningful public discourse.” She explained that during her speaking engagements, she realized that people “want to understand how we arrived at the situation we are in right now, and why.” “They want to see what lessons can be learned from our experiences, and from there perhaps apply the same lessons to their own contexts. They are asking if we see a way forward, and to show them this way,” Robredo, one of the most victimized by fake news in the country, added. She described the purveyors of disinformation as being “organized” with a “set strategies and objectives.” “They are well-funded. And they have shattered social media as a space for political discourse in the Philippines,” she lamented. Robredo addressed for the first time the “Len-Len” videos, which are supported by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s sister, Senator Imee Marcos. It is not only disinformation that the Philippines is fighting against, but “influence operations,” a term coined by Professor Jonathan Ong, a sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who wrote a groundbreaking study about disinformation in the Philippines. “Yung (The) number two ang tawag niya dito sa (he calls in the) research ‘senator satirist’, pero tatawagin na lang natin na (but we will just call) satirist, often in a position of access and power, who delivers coded attacks that can transcend fact-checks,” she said. “Kaya siya hindi nafa-fact check kasi satire nga. Pero familiar naman kayo dito, ‘di ba? ‘Yung mga “Len-Len” videos (They are not being fact checked because they are satire. But you are familiar with these, right? The “Len-Len” videos),” Robredo added. The former official, however, shared hopes of a future free from disinformation. “While more work remains on the horizon, the outcome—even when narrow—holds promise that the tide can be turned, when actions are rooted on promoting transparency and accountability in government and social platforms,” she said.

Manila Bulletin,"The City Social Welfare and Development Office reported that some 648 former drug personalities completed their six-month community-based rehabilitation program that allowed them to be immersed back with the mainstream society and live normal lives. Social Worker Officer Ellen Dayag said there were some 719 former drug offenders from different barangays in the city who initially availed of the community-based rehabilitation program for them to recover from the effects of the use of illegal drugs. Dayag said those who did not complete the program reportedly experienced relapse but efforts are still being undertaken by the concerned agencies and the city government to bring them back to the program to spare them from the dangers of drug use. Dayag said the government agency has been providing psycho-social treatment to the reported drug offenders, many of them classified as low risk, some medium risk while a good number of them were categorized as high risk. According to Dayag, drug dependents who are low risk shall undergo a 30-day rehabilitation program administered by concerned experts duly accredited by the CSWDO, Baguio City Police Office (BCPO) and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), while medium risk will have to undergo a six-month integrated participatory community-based rehabilitation program. Those in the high risk category are subjected to voluntary and involuntary residential treatment that will extend for a longer period of time to allow for their recovery from their addiction. Dayag said there are enough private residential facilities that cater to the rehabilitation needs of drug dependents since there is no public residential drug treatment facility in the Summer Capital. The number of former drug users who underwent the required community-based rehabilitation program is way below the 2,554 that voluntarily surrendered to police authorities during the implementation of the enhanced anti-drug campaign of the previous administration. Dayag said that the CSWDO, BCPO and PDEA continue to provide the appropriate interventions to individuals who need to recover from the impact of the use of illegal drugs for them to recover, rejoin society and live a normal life.

Manila Bulletin,"The House bill (HB) seeking to establish the proposed Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines (VIP) has been approved on second reading.  During House plenary session Tuesday evening, Nov. 29, House Committee on Health Chairman and Batanes lone district Rep. Ciriaco Gato stood at the podium to sponsor House Bill (HB) No. 6452. From there, the measure breezed through the plenary as there were neither interpellators to Gato’s sponsorship speech nor amendments to the bill. The measure was passed on second reading via simple voice vote. “Mr. Speaker, distinguished colleagues, this representation would like to stress that the VIP bill is a priority bill that His Excellency, President Ferdinand [Bongbong] Marcos Jr., has manifested in his very first State of the Nation Address (SONA),” Gato said in his speech. Through the VIP, HB No.6452 aims to strengthen the country’s capacity to address health emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic. The institute will be an attached agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). This envisioned state-of-the-art virology laboratory will be erected in New Clark City, Tarlac. It will be mandated to focus its research on viruses and other pathogens using modern approaches and the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The VIP will be tasked to conduct in-depth studies on viruses and their potential disease-causing agents that affect people, plants, and animals, in order to provide the scientific bases for the treatment of viral diseases, and for the formulation of policies that shall prevent the transmission of these diseases. The measure was principally authored by House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Marcos’s top ally in the legislature. The bill is also part of the Common Legislative Agenda (CLA) of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC). The VIP bill is expected to be passed by the House on third and final reading next week.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Leyte Rep. Richard Gomez has sought a House probe on the “misalignment” in the National Tax Allotments (NTAs) of local government units and the funding requirements for full devolution of specific national public services.  “Mahalagang busisiin ng Kongreso ang isyung ito nang sa ganun ay mabigyang linaw ng national government kung saan kukunin ng ating mga local leaders ang pondo para sa pagsalo ng ibang serbisyong pang-nasyonal (It is important for Congress to closely look into this issue so that the national government could clarify where the local leaders will get funds for other national services),” he said in a statement on Tuesday, Nov. 29.  The lawmaker noted the funds that LGUs receive from national taxes were not enough for full devolution under Executive Order No. 138 and Republic Act 7160. As such, he filed House Resolution (HR) 599, which prodded the chamber to carry out an inquiry on the alleged misalignment. In filing the resolution, Gomez said that “the calculation of (the) NTA, as mandated (under) RA 7160, is not aligned with the costing of devolved functions” under RA 7160 and EO 138, which was issued on June 1, 2021 following the Supreme Court’s Mandanas-Garcia decision. The SC in 2019 ruled in favor of Gov. Hermilando Mandanas and Gov. Enrique Garcia Jr. and granted substantial, additional, and proportional increases in the local government’s national tax allotments. EO 138, issued by former president Rodrigo Duterte in June 2021, provides for the full devolution of certain functions of the executive branch of the government– including implementation of local infrastructure projects–to LGUs in line with the High Court’s Mandanas-Garcia ruling. “The increase in national tax allotment for LGUs, as a result of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling, is not guaranteed to fully cover all devolved functions” under EO 138 and RA 7160, Gomez asserted. He called on his colleagues in the House of Representatives to echo his call for President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to repeal EO 138. “I am appealing to President Marcos to nullify EO 138 as Congress and the Executive thresh out the various issues that have cropped up related to the implementation of the full devolution of services,” he said. “Ayusin po muna natin ang lahat ng usapin at saka po natin pag-usapan uli ang (Let us fix first all the issues and then we discuss again the) full devolution,” Gomez added. In a separate proposed bill, the lawmaker said: “This representation maintains that we have not yet attained the optimal conditions for full devolution. Much as it seems that additional, yet proportional NTAs for each LGU would solve the budget gaps in each LGU, it is not as simple as that. At the onset of the full devolution process, various issues have arisen that signal a fiscal crisis among LGUs, especially in the next two years.” To address the funding issues related to fully devolving national functions to LGUs, Gomez filed House Bill (HB) No. 6414 which calls for the creation of a fund that would provide gap financing for LGUs that have incurred deficits in the years leading to full devolution. The proposed “Local Government Units Full Devolution Gap Financing Fund (the Fund)” is aimed at servicing all LGUs regardless of income brackets. Aside from providing gap financing, his bill proposes the conversion of the Growth Equity Fund, which was created under EO 138, as initial funding component for the Fund. Under the measure, the LGUs with budget surpluses will be allowed to invest in the Fund as capital for soft loans to LGUs in deficits, thus giving LGUs “an opportunity to help one another.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"“Very encouraging.”  This was how President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. described the latest survey showing 85 percent of Filipino adults strongly believe the country is headed in the right direction. “Well, of course, it’s very encouraging that people think that we are moving in the right direction,” Marcos told the press during his visit to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) headquarters in Los Banos, Laguna on Tuesday, Nov. 29. Based on the 4th quarter of 2022 Tugon ng Masa survey of OCTA Research Group, 85 percent of Filipino adults strongly agree that the Philippines is headed in the right direction, while 6 percent think otherwise. According to Marcos, the result of the survey, which has 1,200 adult respondents, is important to him as it shows that the government has at least made its presence felt at every level of the society. “I have not been able to study it really but nakita ko yung (but I saw that) it crosses demographics. The number is more or less the same across demographics. So that is important to me because every class of society must feel that they are being served by the government,” he said. “With that kind of statistic then it looks like we have at least— that we have made the government felt at every level of society,” he stressed. Those in the Visayas registered the highest agreement that the country is moving in the right direction, with 91 percent, while 87 percent in Balance Luzon, or Luzon outside Metro Manila, 84 percent in Mindanao, and 70 percent of adult Filipinos in Metro Manila. Among classes A to E, 79 to 86 percent agree the Philippines is on the right path under Marcos’ leadership. In the survey conducted on Oct. 23 to 27, Filipino respondents were asked the question: “Based on the policies and programs presented and implemented by the current administration, do you think the country is leading in the right way?”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is seeking to modernize the rice sector at a time when a pandemic and war showed “how fundamental” the agriculture sector is.  In his visit to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) headquarters in Los Baños, Laguna on Tuesday, Nov. 29, Marcos raised the need to adopt supportive policies to modernize the rice sector as part of a vibrant agri-food industry in the Philippines. He urged stakeholders to support the government in elevating the current condition of the local rice industry and pushing for sustainable rice value chains. “There are new technologies that address the problems that we are facing, and that those technologies are beginning to be disseminated down to the local farmers,” Marcos said. He stressed that global issues, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, reminded the world of “how fundamental” the agriculture sector is. “The pandemic and the situation in Ukraine have been a glaring reminder of how fundamental the agricultural sector is and food supply is to not only in the Philippines but to the entire world,” the chief executive said. “We hope to strengthen those partnerships because we very much need — not only to be able to disseminate or to provide these new varieties, the new techniques — but we also have to have a more focused approach to how we deal with the agricultural sector to the rice lands in the Philippines,” he pointed out. Marcos said his visit to the IRRI gave him hope in terms of the available technologies the country has for the agriculture sector. “Ang maganda sa naging resulta nitong bisita ay marami tayong nakita na meron sila bagong (What’s good about our visit here is we saw many new) technologies that are completely appropriate to the Philippine setting so nabigyan kami ng pag-asa na (we were given hope that) it’s up to us now in the Philippine government to make sure those technologies, those products go down to the grassroots,” the President said. He further said that it gives him hope that “the research that we were doing is headed exactly in those directions that we feel are going to be necessary.” In his visit to the IRRI, Marcos was briefed about the various initiatives being done to improve crop resilience, which includes direct seeding of rice; laser land leveling (LLL) which is a laser-guided mechanized system to redistribute soil across a field for a leveled and uniform cultivation area, significantly improving water and input efficiency and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions of paddy farming; solar bubble dryer which is a low-cost seed drying technology that can be set up anywhere, eliminating losses from traditional sun drying such as spillage, animals, weather, and vehicles running over the grains; and hermetic storage system, wherein airtight seed storage containers in various sizes help reduce oxygen and moisture penetration, minimizing losses from insects and rot and helping preserve grain quality for longer.

Manila Bulletin,"Like his previous statement, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said he would only leave the Department of Agriculture (DA) once he achieved the things he wanted to. “Actually I have a schedule, I have a time table for that,” Marcos said on Tuesday, Nov. 29, when asked about designating a new DA chief, which he currently holds in a concurrent capacity. “There (is) certain things I’d like to achieve before leaving the department. So hindi pa tayo nandun (We are not there yet),” he added. This came as a reiteration of his statement in October that he will remain as the Agriculture chief because he is “still needed there,” stressing that there are things that must be handled only by the President, especially over years-long and deeply-rooted problems in the department. Marcos, however, revealed that he has actually been considering some names to replace him as the DA chief. “But of course maraming lumalabas na pangalan, tuloy tuloy ang pagtingin namin (there are a lot of names coming out, we are continuously considering them),” he said. The number of people he is considering keeps decreasing and increasing, he said, adding that he will only nominate one when his “checklist” is accomplished. “Hopefully by the time yung checklist ko natapos na, meron na tayong pwedeng i-nominate na DA (my checklist is done, we can finally nominate a DA Secretary),” Marcos said. Last month, the chief executive justified his decision to stay as the DA secretary because the problems in the agriculture sector are “so difficult that it will take a president to change and turn it around.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality is keen on inviting members of the Philippines’ Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) to shed light on the human trafficking of Filipinos into Myanmar. The matter of inviting members of the AVSECOM to the Senate’s probe into the alleged outbound human trafficking activities in Thailand and Myanmar was raised by Sen. Raffy Tulfo and was seconded by Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who chairs the Senate panel. This was after the panel heard the testimony of “Paulo,” one of the human trafficking victims, who testified before the committee on how he was given a fake ID pass by alleged airport officials at NAIA Terminal 3 so he can board his flight to Thailand where he was supposedly promised work in a telemarketing company. Fortunately, Paulo said he was able to “escape” from the ordeal which could have led him to work for a crypto-scamming job in Myanmar. Tulfo raised alarm over the incident, pointing out that the incident also shows a “clear and present danger” to the country. “Meron talagang clear and present danger dito na madaling mapasok ng terorista kung ganon (itong ating mga airports). Kasi pwede nila gamiting itong mga fake na passes, wala nang kapkap, wala nang scrutiny. Dala-dala ang bag na may bomba, and yun, patay na tayo, (There is really a clear and present danger here, because it means a terrorist can easily penetrate our airports. Because they can use fake passes, no frisking, no scrutiny. They can bring bombs inside and explode and that would be the death of us),” Tulfo pointed out during the hearing. “So meron talaga tayong lapse in security dito. Kailangan talaga palalimin natin ang imbestigasyon dito (So we really have a lapse in security here. We really need to get into the bottom of this in this investigation),” the senator added. “Kailangan natin ipatawag ang AVSECOM, kelangan may masibak sa AVSECOM (we need to call for the AVSECOM, heads should roll in the AVSECOM),” he reiterated. “Sila ang nakakaalam ng proseso, hindi ka pwede pumasok kung hindi ka dumaan sa proseso. May sumalo sa kanila (victims) at may sumundo sa kanila na myembro ng sindikato na kasabwat—I’m sure may kasabwat dito sa AVSECOM, na nag i-screen ng mga IDs. Kaya dapat ipatawag ang AVSECOM at dapat may managot dito (They know the process, you can’t enter if you haven’t gone through the process. Somebody assisted the victims and someone picked them up who is clearly a member of the syndicate, who is evidently an accomplice—I’m sure there was an accomplice here at AVSECOM, who screened the IDs. So AVSECOM should be summoned and someone should be held accountable,” Tulfo also said. Hontiveros agreed and directed the panel to send an invitation to the AVSECOM to appear in the next hearing. In his testimony, Paulo explained that his recruiter, a certain Laisa Magallanes told him that an “escort” would help him with immigration to expedite his departure from the Philippines and was told that P30,000 would be deducted from his salary for this service. But after checking in, Paulo said the so-called “escort” told him to get out of the line at the immigration counter and asked him for his passport. When it was returned to him, he was later surprised to see that his passport already has a stamp of the Bureau of Immigration (BI). “Even without going through the immigration counter, Paulo’s passport was stamped with the official BI exit stamp. Someone handled him at the airport, bypassed immigration, and gave him a fake ID from WHSmith, a store in NAIA Terminal 3, to pretend to be an employee. Paulo was suddenly afraid of the process he was being made to go through, so he told the recruiter that he would not continue,” Hontiveros explained. “It’s like pastillas part 2, but worse and more intense. Are airport security or personnel also involved? Are the illegal recruiters in the pockets and complicity of BI or airport officials? The pain that many Filipinos in other countries are suffering because of our fellow Filipinos who take advantage for their own interests,” the senator added. Last week, Hontiveros gave a privilege speech about alias Rita, and 11 other overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), who were promised jobs in Thailand, but were trafficked into Myanmar to become crypto scammers of a Chinese syndicate based in Shwe Kokko, a town in the Kayin State of Myanmar. In the hearing, the deputy minority leader called attention to the OFWs who are still in Myanmar, many of whom are physically abused by their Chinese employers. During the hearing she introduced alias “Baby,” a trafficked Filipino who almost died in the hands of her Chinese employer in Shwe Kokko. “Hindi katanggap-tanggap ang sinapit ni Baby. Kuryente, baton, latigo ang sinapit niya at ng kanyang mga kasama. Marami pa sila ang nasa Myanmar pa at kailangang-kailangan ang agarang aksyon ng ating gobyerno (What happened to Baby is unacceptable. She and his companions were subjected to electricity, batons, and whips. Many of them are still in Myanmar and the immediate action of our government is essential),” Hontiveros said. “Unfortunately, many Filipinos go through this illegal process, no matter how dubious, because of desperation,” she lamented. Faced with employment challenges in the Philippines, the constant increase in prices while there is no progress in workers’ salaries, Hontiveros said Filipinos cannot be blamed if they choose to accept dubious job opportunities just to give something to their families. “This is also a challenge for us in government not only to clean up our immigration system, but also to urgently provide adequate and dignified jobs and livelihood for every Filipino,” Hontiveros stressed.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Monday, Nov. 28, released the guidelines for the computation of the mandatory 13th-month pay for private-sector workers for this year. DOLE Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma released the guidelines, under Labor Advisory No. 23, using the P570 daily wage in National Capital Region (NCR) as the template. Under the law, the 13th-month pay shall not be less than one-twelfth (1/12) of the total basic salary earned by an employee within a calendar year. Covered by the benefits are workers regardless of their position, designation, or employment status, and irrespective of the method by which their wages are paid–provided they have worked for at least one month during the calendar year. “Thirteenth-month pay shall be paid to rank-and-file employees in the private sector, regardless of their position, designation, or employment status, and irrespective of the method by which their wages are paid, provided that they have worked for at least one month during the calendar year,” the advisory read. The Labor Department also released a guideline for computing the duly 13th-month pay based on the prevailing daily basic wage. “It shall also be given to rank-and-file employees who are paid on a piece-rate basis, fixed or guaranteed wage plus commission, with multiple employers, resigned or were terminated, and were on maternity leave and receive salary differential are also entitled to 13th-month pay,” it added. Based on the matrix of basic wage in the NCR at P570 per day and a six-day workweek or an equivalent Monthly Basic Salary of P14,867.50 (P570.00*313/12 months). To compute the proportionate 13th-month collectibles, DOLE said the total sum of the basic salary for the whole year, divided by 12, will be the 13th-month pay provisions. “The minimum amount shall be given without prejudice to existing company practice or policy, employment contract or collective bargaining agreement (CBA) if any,” the DOLE said. Meanwhile, the DOLE warned all private employers to implement the mandatory 13th-month pay rules under Presidential Decree 851.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Covid-19 cases per day in the country may increase to close to 2,300 by the end of December, based on the latest projection of the Department of Health (DOH). “If our MPHS (minimum public health standards) compliance further decreases, our daily cases will probably range from 1,114 to as high as 2,294 by the end of December,” said DOH Epidemiology Bureau Director Dr. Alethea de Guzman in a media forum on Tuesday, Nov. 29. De Guzman said that the decrease in compliance to MPHS can be attributed to the holiday season, wherein people are expected to have more interaction and less physical distance. However, if the people’s compliance to MPHS “remain the same,” the number of cases may further decrease to fewer than 500 per day. “You may see numbers totaling to just around 429 by December of 2022,” said De Guzman. Based on the DOH data, the country’s average number of cases daily was at 1,147 for the period of Nov. 21 to 27. Currently, the hospital admissions remain at low-levels even with the detection of new variants of coronavirus, said De Guzman. “Even with the detection of these new variants, there is no significant increase in our hospitalizations—whether it’s the total ICU and severe and critical admissions. hindi tayo nakakakita ng malaking pagtaas ng ating mga admissions (We are not seeing an increase in admissions). It has not reached the numbers of Alpha, Beta, Delta, or Omicron,” she said. De Guzman said that the possible increase in cases can be avoided if more people will get vaccinated and boosted against Covid-19. “These are actually outcomes that we can prevent, we can prevent that by increasing our vaccinations,” she said. “We are really focused on vaccination. Again, we need to maintain that high immunity wall not just for ourselves, the reminder is not for me alone or you alone but it’s for your family, it’s for your circles to ensure that everyone has that high protection,” she added. Infectious disease expert Dr. Edsel Salvana also echoed the importance of vaccination and masking. “Deaths and healthcare utilization will remain low as long as the wall of immunity is maintained,” he said. “Masks and vaccines continue to protect us,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is set to sign an executive order (EO) that aims to promote ease of doing business in the country and attract foreign investments. Malacañang announced on Tuesday, Nov. 29, the expected signing of the EO after the President’s meeting with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). During the meeting, DTI presented the proposed EO on the Creation of Green Lane for Strategic Investments after identifying the barrier across multiple regulatory agencies that hamper the smooth entry of foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the country. The EO will mandate concerned offices to establish a Green Lane to expedite and streamline the process and requirements for the issuance of permits and licenses, including resolutions of issues concerning strategic investments. “Malaking bagay yun (That’s a huge thing). That will address immediately yung tinatawag na (the) ease of doing business na laging nirereklamo sa atin (that are always the subject of complaints),” Marcos said during the meeting. “Until we get to change the procedures… and to say that… baka ito hindi na kailangan, baka ito extraneous na ito, ito obsolete na ito, ganyan (perhaps this is no longer needed, this is extraneous, this is obsolete). You cut it down as much as we can,” he ordered. The proposed EO will cover all national government agencies (NGAs) and their regional and provincial offices, local government units (LGUs) and quasi-judicial bodies involved in issuing permits and licenses necessary for establishing strategic investments in the country. It mandates NGAs and LGUs to act on a permit or license application not longer than three working days in the case of a simple transaction, seven working days in the case of complex transactions, and 20 working days for highly technical transactions from the date of receipt. A technical working group headed by the DTI’s Board of Investments (BOI) will implement the EO and a BOI-Investment Assistance Service (BOI-IAS) will become the single point of entry of investment availing of the Green Lane services endorsed as nationally significant or highly desirable projects. Non-compliance with the EO’s provisions will be a ground for administrative and disciplinary sanctions against any erring public officer or employee, as provided under existing laws and regulations.

Manila Bulletin,"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has reacted to the petition for a writ of amparo filed by two pastors and a lay leader against the military leadership after they were allegedly tagged by personnel of the 59th Infantry “Protector” Battalion (59IB) of the 2nd Infantry Division as communist rebels. “We haven’t received yet the formal copy of the petition. In the meantime, we will look at the allegations and will answer in the proper forum,” Col. Jorry Baclor, chief of AFP public affairs office, shortly replied on Monday night, Nov. 28, when asked by reporters. According to reports, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) pastors Edwin and Julieta Egar and lay leader Ronald Ramos filed a petition for a writ of amparo before the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday. The High Court describes the petition for a writ of amparo as a “remedy available to any person whose right to life, liberty and security is violated and threatened with violation by an unlawful act or ommission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity.” The petitioners reportedly accused the troops of the Mauban, Quezon-based 59IB of coercing them to surrender and admit to being members of the New People’s Army despite the lack of evidence last Oct. 31. They were also supposedly threatened by the troops that they will be subjected to a search operation, while a text message allegedly from the military warned the petitioners that they will be killed in a fabricated shootout. According to reports, named respondents in the petition were AFP Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Bartolome Vicente Bacarro; Philippine Army Commanding General, Lt. Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr.; 2nd Infantry Division commander, Maj. Gen. Roberto Capulong; 59th IB Commander, Lt. Col. Ernesto Teneza Jr.; and 59IB officers Sgt. Ronald Dalo, Sgt. John Granpil, Pvts. First Class Borge Ebol, Roy Dela Peña, and Bong Samela among others. The 59IB has yet to respond to the issue. However, in a social media post, the 59th IB denied another allegation of red-tagging by labor group Kasama TK (Katipunan ng mga Samahang Magbubukid sa Timog Katagalugan) involving one “Gigi Bautista,” a farmer and chairman of Barangay Agrarian Reform Council (BARC) in Calaca, Batangas. According to the group, Bautista’s house was stormed by military personnel last Nov. 27. The individual was also supoosedly threatened by the troops that his house will be raided and he might “end up dead” if things got awry. The 59IB denied the allegation. “Bilib na bilib din kami sa sigasig ninyo sa pag-gawa at pagpapakalat ng fake news. Tandaan, hindi kaugalian ng mga kasundaluhan na mandahas ng mga mamamayan (We are in awe of your persistence to create and spread fake news. Remember, it is not cuatomary for the military to harass the public),” the 59IB said in a Facebook post Monday. The troops said they only visited the house of Bautista to hold a dialogue. ",0

According to Makati City Mayor Abby Binay, a total of 83,857 Blu Card senior citizens holders will receive the year-end cash incentive early as the city government aims to spare them from the holiday rush and give them more time to plan ahead on what or where to spend their cash incentives. “We want our senior Makatizens to be happy and feel that they are loved and cared for, that is why we made sure that they receive their cash incentives from the city government early,” Binay said. Under the expanded benefits program for senior citizens, Blu Card holders receive their cash incentives twice a year: every July and December. For the year-end, seniors 60-69 years old will receive P1,500; 70-79 years old, P2,000; 80-89 years old, P2,500; and 90-99 years old, P5,000.

As of Nov. 8, the Makati Action Center has already distributed 6,298 Christmas bags to senior citizens. “We usually distribute the Pamaskong Handog bags during the first week of December. These bags that contain assorted food products for Noche Buena have become a much-anticipated tradition for Proud Makatizens,” Binay said. She explained that the city government moved up the distribution of the gift bags so that families need not worry about preparations for the traditional family meal during Christmas time especially now that the prices of most commodities continue to rise. Each bag contains two cans of Spam luncheon meat, two cans of Vienna sausage, two cans of corned beef, one pack of spaghetti pasta with sauce, one can of fruit cocktail, one can of condensed milk, one can of cream, one box of cheese, and 2 Makatizen t-shirts.

Manila Bulletin,"San Juan City Mayor and Metro Manila Council (MMC) President Francis Zamora said the MMC is set to release guidelines on the firecracker ban to be implemented in the National Capital Region (NCR) as part of its efforts to minimize the number of injuries caused by the misuse of firecrackers during the new year revelry. During the joint session of the MMC and the Regional Development Council (RDC) which he co-chairs, Zamora said that the Metro Manila mayors will convene to discuss the guidelines they will implement regarding the firecracker ban which was first imposed by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017. Executive Order no. 28, “Providing For The Regulation and Control of the Use of Firecrackers And Other Pyrotechnic Devices,” bans individuals from using firecrackers or setting up their own fireworks displays, a cultural tradition Filipinos are accustomed to during “events of personal, religious, cultural and national importance,” especially during New Year’s Eve or even the Chinese New Year. Magkakaroon ng designated firecracker areas. Ngunit depende din yan sa pagkakasunduan ng mayors kasi each city will have its own designated fireworks area para iwas syempre sa aksidente ngayong bagong taon (There will be designated firecracker areas, but these will depend on what the mayors of each city will agree upon because each city will have its own designated fireworks area to avoid accidents this new year),” Zamora said. The EO sets forth the criteria that must be complied with before a display of fireworks can qualify such as: it must be conducted on the occasion or as part of a celebration, competition, or similar event held in a venue other than the residence; it is conducted under the supervision of Philippine National Police (PNP) – licensed and trained personnel; and, it has a municipal/city permit that states the date, time and area where the display will be conducted. In December last year, the PNP released the names and brands of allowed and prohibited firecrackers and pyrotechnics. RA 7183 and EO 28 enumerated these firecrackers as regulated:   Baby Rocket   Bawang   El Diablo   Judas’ Belt   Paper Caps   Pulling of Strings Sky Rocket (Kwitis)   Small “Triangulo”   Other types of firecrackers that are not oversized, not overweight, and not imported.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Mark A. Villar has filed a bill seeking to grant 13th month pay for contractual and job order personnel in the government service. “Contractual workers (COs) and job order (JO) personnel play a vital role in government service. They fulfill their duties diligently and passionately comparable to permanent government employees. Notwithstanding, they are not entitled to mid-year and year-end bonuses, such as the 13th-month pay, among other benefits.” Villa said in his explanatory note of Senate Bill 1528, or the ‘’13th Month Pay Law.’’ Villar said job order and contractual workers do not receive benefits such as mid-year and year-end-bonus that regular or permanent employees of government get. During his stint as Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) secretary, Villar said he saw the needs of government employees and his appreciation of the situation prompted him to file SB 1528. “In light of the persistent rise in the inflation rate, which led to an extraordinary increase in prices of food, fuel, and other commodities, Filipino workers, including contractual and job order personnel of the government face greater hardships in their lives. Contractual and job order personnel lack security of tenure,” he added. Villar said that based on his bill, the 13th month pay of job orders and contractual workers should not be less than one half of their monthly pay. “Ang pagpasa ng naturang panukala ay dapat gawing prayoridad habang may natitira pang panahon (The passage of the bill should be done posthaste). Ito ay upang masuklian ang hindi matatawarang kontribusyon at serbisyo ng mga JO sa ating pamahalaan (This will repay the services done by job orders to the government). Munting pasasalamat lamang sa kanilang sipag, sakripisyo at pagsisiguro na naibibigay ng gobyerno ang mga programa sa mga kababayan natin sa buong taon (The government knows how to repay the dedication and sacrifices of these workers this year),” he explained. ‘’Nakaakma ang panukalang batas na ito base sa inilabas kamakailan na Joint Circular No. 2 ng Department of Budget and Management (DBM) at Commission on Audit (COA) na nagpapalawig ng serbisyo ng mga JO at COS sa pamahalaan hanggang Disyembre ng 2024 (This bill supports the recent Joint Circular No. 2 of DBM and COA extending the services of JOs and COs until December, 2024),’’ he pointed out. Villar expected some 642,000 non-permanent government workers to benefit from the passage of the measure by Congress.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The best is yet to come in terms of the country’s economic recovery under the Marcos administration. House Speaker Martin Romualdez confidently made this declaration Tuesday morning, Nov. 29 at Business World’s Economic Forum held at the Grand Hyatt Manila in Taguig City. Romualdez, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s top ally in the legislature, addressed during the event members of the local business community on the current economic direction of the Philippines “We are on the first stage to full economic recovery and we are marching in the right direction,” said the Leyte 1st district congressman. “Judging from interests shown by global businessmen in our international roadshow with the President, the Philippines may soon become the favorite investment destination in Asia. We, in Congress, are committed to bring this goal to reality,” Romualdez said. “Now is the opportune time to invest in the Philippines.” “The best is yet to come,” the House leader further said, even as he appealed to the business sector and the public in general to “stay the course with us, and share the benefits of progress and development”. He said the Marcos administration has crafted an “Agenda for Prosperity”, which has as its core mission the country’s economic transformation towards inclusivity and sustainability. “We in Congress are one with the President in this mission,” added Romualdez, president of the Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) party. He noted the Philippines’ gross domestic product or GDP improved by an average of 7.7 percent for the first three quarters of 2022. He said it only needs to grow by 3.3 percent to 6.9 percent this fourth quarter to meet the growth target of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent this year. Romualdez said the administration’s economic development objectives were spelled out in the medium-term fiscal framework and its eight-point socio-economic plan, which the House of Representatives had adopted through Concurrent Resolution No. 2 shortly after the 19th Congress convened in July. Marcos officially took over the Palace seat only last June 30.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora urged the Department of Health (DOH) to allow other priority groups in the country to receive the second booster shot against Covid-19 as the Philippines detected other variants of the virus that are said to be more transmissible and even have the ability to evade the vaccines’ protective properties. “Ako po ay nananawagan sa DOH na sana po aralin na at baka pwedeng payagan na po kami kumuha ng second booster tutal madami naman po tayong supply ng bakuna kesa ma-expire po ito at masayang, sana eh ibakuna nalang bilang second booster sa mga nakapag first booster na (I am urging the DOH to please study and allow us to receive the second booster especially now that we have abundant supply of the vaccine instead of letting it go to waste),” Zamora said in an interview with GMA. “Syempre at the end of the day, ang DOH pa din ang nakakaalam po nyan ngunit isang bagay lang po tong naisip ko dahil nakikita natin sa balita na madaming naeexpire na mga bakuna, kaya baka pwedeng gamitin na ito bilang second booster (Of course at the end of the day, the DOH is still the one that will decide on it. This is only one of the ways that I can think of in avoiding the wastage of the vaccines especially now that we can see that a lot of vaccines have already expired. Hence my plea to allow the vaccines to be used as the second booster),” he added. Seeing the positive effects of the Covid-19 vaccine, the mayor underscored the importance of the vaccine in ensuring the safety of not just his constituents but also the public. “Well, we can see still that even fully vaccinated individuals get Covid, but what we should look at really is the severity of their condition. Let’s not focus just on the number of cases but let’s look at how many are severe, how many are critical, how many are mild to asymptomatic,” Zamora said in an Oct. 15 interview. “Our hospital utilization rate is also low, where majority of Covid-19 patients in our hospitals are actually residents from other cities and provinces,” he added. “We have gone to the extent of going house-to-house for our booster vaccination. In fact, I have acted as an ambassador for the vaccination program. I believe that as mayor, it is my duty to push for a high vaccination rate. This is something we have achieved. We remain to be number one in terms of number of fully vaccinated individuals in relation to our target population and also in the administration of the first booster,” the mayor said. In a press briefing in August, DOH OIC Maria Rosario Vergeire opposed the idea of administering a second booster shot to all fully-vaccinated individuals in the country. “Sinasabi nila kasi, para maubos na lang ang bakuna, payagan na ang rest of the population for the second booster shot (They are saying we have to use all the vaccines by administering it as second booster shot to the rest of the population),” Vergeire said. “We base our decisions on science and evidence. We need to ensure and protect the health of Filipinos. And by saying that, hindi po kami magbibigay ng bakuna sa ating mga kababayan ng walang sapat na ebidensya (we will not give vaccines to our countrymen without sufficient evidence),” she added. The emergency use authorization issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only allows individuals who are 50 years old and above, as well as those from 18 to 49 age group that have comorbidities, to receive a second booster against Covid-19.

Manila Bulletin,"Senior Deputy Speaker and former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has praised the Philippine Association of Food Technologists, Inc. (PAFT) for supporting the Marcos administration’s call toward human security, which he said was hinged on food. “Because the world is in the midst of a technological revolution, food tech is leading the way in transforming the global food sector,” Arroyo, Pampanga’s 2nd district representative, said in her speech during the recent 61st annual convention of the PAFT. The PAFT’s convention theme for this year is “Food for all–Responding to the need of the global market.” “Food tech is increasing food production to help reduce the rate of hunger and feed the world. The expansion and diversification of the food trade can be attributed, among other factors, to the discipline of food technology which is continuously providing a broader range of foods by developing new and more sophisticated preservation, processing and packaging techniques which make foods safer, less perishable and more attractive to the consumer,” she said. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., in his concurrent role as Department of Agriculture (DA) secretary, has been bent on increasing food production in the country amid global supply shortages and price spikes caused by inflation. Taking note of the convention theme, Arroyo lauded the PAFT “for designing your program to inspire and feature sustained local farming, innovative solutions and technologies and latest consumer trends to help advance food safety, nutrition and regulations in the Philippines and the global market”. “A strong national food industry is an important supplier of food to the population and a significant contributor to food security,” she added. The House senior deputy speaker further lauded the PAFT for supporting Marcos’s goals towards human security, quoting what the President stated at the recently-concluded Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit: “Food is not just a trade commodity, it is not a livelihood; it is a survival imperative, it is a moral imperative. It is the very basis of human security.” Although she did not mention it in her speech, Arroyo emphasized food security, particularly rice sufficiency, during her presidency. In the early part of her term, rice costing P16 to P18 per kilo was made available at particular stores accessible to the most vulnerable sectors. When prices of imported rice doubled during the 2008 recession, she ordered the National Food Authority (NFA) to subsidize rice prices so the agency could continue selling rice at P18.25 per kilo. Cheaper rice was sold at NFA and certain government-run outlets. Arroyo was the chief executive from 2001 to 2010.   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The government’s housing program got a big boost after the Home Development Mutual Fund, or the Pag-IBIG Fund, has allocated P250 billion to address the 6.5 million housing backlog in the country. Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) Secretary Jose Rizalino Acuzar said the huge fund allocation, along with the commitment of support of several financial institutions and local government units (LGUs), puts the goal of building one million housing units every year on the right track. The allocation of P250 billion was approved during a meeting of the Pag-IBIG Fund Board of Trustees headed by Acuzar. “This is a huge boost to our President’s Pambansang Pabahay para sa Pilipino Program –a giant step towards realizing the dream of every Filipino family to have decent, safe and affordable shelters,” Acuzar said. The government’s housing program is intended for informal settler families and those in the low income bracket. Part of the program is the building of in-city, on-site housing units in order to ensure that the beneficiaries would keep their jobs in the areas where they live. In the past, several housing units were abandoned as the beneficiaries would choose to go back to the city as they complained that the location of the housing units are too far from their work places, which means that they have to shell out more money for transportation. Acuzar earlier said that the DHSUD needs at least P36 billion a year to realize the one million housing units goal every year. “With the assured funding support from Pag-IBIG Fund, I am very very optimistic of the success of the program which is designed to address the country’s housing backlog pegged at more than 6.5 million,” said Acuzar.

Manila Bulletin,"Two New People’s Army (NPA) rebels were killed in a clash with the Army 62nd Infantry Battalion (IB) in Sitio Upper Binataan, Barangay Quintin Remo, Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental on Monday, Nov. 28. The Army identified the fatalities as Johnhilll Sarsa, alias ‘’Mark,’’ of Barangay Planas, and Dalmacio dela Torre, alias ‘’Delmar,’’ of Barangay Trinidad, both in Guilhulngan City, Negros Oriental. According to the 62nd IB, Sarsa was a political officer of the Sandatahang Yunit Pampropaganda (SYP) Platoon Lenovo, Central Negros Front 1 (CN1), Komiteng Rehiyon-Negros Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor (KR-NCBS) of the NPA while Dela Torre was a member of CN1, KR-NCBS. Brig. Gen. Inocencio Pasaporte, commander of the 303rd Infantry Brigade (IBde), said that troops clashed with at least 15 NPA rebels at around 7 a.m. The firefight lasted for about 40 minutes. No casualties were reported on the government side, Pasaporte added. Troops recovered from the encounter site high-powdered firearms such as AK47, two M16 rifles, M203 grenade launcher, M14 rifle, and .357 caliber revolver with ammunition, three magazines for AK47, seven magazines for M16, two rifle grenades, 40mm high explosive ammunition, two bandoliers, two NPA flags, medical supplies, subversive documents, and personal belongings. Pasaporte said the Army was conducting security operation in the area following the killing of former barangay tanod Jovanie Omboy on Nov. 20 in Barangay Puso, La Castellana, Negros Occidental, situated at the boundary of the two municipalities. The NPA claimed killing Omboy for being a member of the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit. But police said that Omboy was only mistaken as a CAFGU. Pasaporte believes that these NPA rebels were behind the death of Omboy, 43, of Barangay Montilla, Moises Padilla. Pursuit operation against the fleeing communist guerillas is ongoing.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives unanimously approved on third and final reading Monday afternoon, Nov. 28 a measure that seeks to expand the elements of game-fixing and provides stiffer penalties for such offenses in professional and amateur sports contests. Hurdling the plenary Monday, Nov. 28 on the strength of 249 affirmative votes during nominal voting was House Bill (HB) No. 4513. Deputy Speaker and Davao City 3rd district Rep. Isidro Ungab, who took over the rostrum from Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto during the plenary consideration of HB No.4513, declared that there were neither negative votes nor abstentions. The bill defines game-fixing as “any arrangement, agreement, scheme, or act or series of acts, wherein any person or persons, maliciously conduct or cause to be conducted any professional or amateur sports other than on the basis of the honest playing skill or ability of the players or participants or even deliberately limiting the skill or ability of any player or participant in a game, race, or sports competition in order to influence the process or to produce a pre-determined result for purposes of gambling, betting, or as part of a scheme to defraud the public on the conduct and outcome of the game”. Proof of actual payment or receipt of money or any valuable consideration is not a requirement to constitute the crime of game-fixing but it shall be deemed a prima facie evidence of its commission, the bill said. The measure’s authors include House Majority Leader and Zamboanga City 2nd district Rep. Manuel Jose “Mannix” Dalipe, 1-Pacman Party-list Rep. Mikee Romero, Northern Samar 1st district Rep. Paul Daza, ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro, and Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas. “This proposed measure seeks to expand the elements constituting the crime of game fixing and prescribe stiffer penalties to arrest the widespread illicit practice, and by so doing, to promote the true spirit of sportsmanship,” the authors said. Other forms of game-fixing such as point-shaving, game machination, and the act of wilfully abetting, aiding, or inducing any person to commit game-fixing and profiting from it are also penalized under the measure. Point-shaving refers to any such arrangement, combination, scheme, or agreement by which the skill or ability of any player or participant in a game, race or sports competition to make points or scores shall be deliberately limited to influence the result in favor of one or the other team, player or participant therein. On the other hand, game machinations refer to any other fraudulent, deceitful, unfair or dishonest means, method, manner or practice employed for the purpose of influencing the result of any game, race, or sports contest. Under the measure, game-fixing is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another to perform the prohibited acts specified in Sections 3 and 4 of the measure. The bill imposes the penalty of imprisonment from three years and one day to six years, or a fine of not less than P1 million but not more than P5 million, or both at the discretion of the court for violation of provisions of the law. When the offender is an athlete, promoter, referee, umpire, judge, or coach, the penalty imposed is imprisonment from six years and one day to 12 years or a fine of not less than P1 million but not more than P5 million, or both. The penalty of life imprisonment or a fine of not less than P10 million but not more than P50 million or both, is imposed if the offender is a member of a syndicate. Game-fixing is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another to perform the prohibited acts. If the offender is a public officer, whether elected or appointed, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding any public office, the maximum penalty shall be imposed. The same level of penalty applies if the offender is an officer of a partnership, corporation, association, or any juridical entity, who directly participated, consented, or knowingly tolerated the game-fixing, as well as an alien, who would also be deported after serving his sentence. Any person who proposes, attempts, or conspires to commit game-fixing shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment from one year to three years, or a fine of not less than P500,000 but not more than P1 million or both. Likewise, any person engaged in professional sports convicted by final judgment, or those in amateur sports convicted for the same offense for the second time, shall suffer perpetual disqualification to participate in any capacity in competitive sports in the country. Whistle-blowers who voluntarily disclose information on, or assist in the prosecution of game-fixing shall be exempt from any liability and may be admitted to the Witness Protection Program (WPP).

Manila Bulletin,"A House bill (HB) seeking to promote the country’s indigenous writing systems was unanimously approved on third and final reading Monday afternoon, Nov. 28. With 251 “yes” votes, zero “no” votes, and zero abstentions, HB No.6069 finally hurdled the plenary after the conduct of nominal voting. Deputy Speaker and Davao City 3rd district Rep. Isidro Ungab announced the result of the voting. The measure, known as the proposed Philippine Indigenous and Traditional Writing Systems Act, seeks to “generate greater awareness of indigenous and traditional scripts of the Philippines and engender wider appreciation of their significance and beauty… as part of our cultural treasures”. “While these writing systems are being revived again, it is becoming vulnerable and in danger of misrepresentation and alteration due to technological advancements. Proper and official recognized standardization, publication, and documentation must be established in order for the writing systems to sustain its intrinsic characteristics,” Tingog Party-list Reps. Yedda Marie Romualdez and Jude Acidre, two of the principal authors of the bill, said. House Speaker and Leyte 1st district Rep. Martin Romualdez is also an author. “It is the declared policy of the State to foster the preservation, enrichment, and dynamic evolution of a Filipino national culture based on the principle of unity in diversity in a climate of free artistic and intellectual expression. To this end, the State shall promote, protect, preserve, and conserve the Philippine indigenous and traditional writing systems as a means to inculcate patriotism and social consciousness among the citizenry,” HB No.6069 read. Aside from the inclusion of the indigenous writing systems in subjects, the bill also mandates the Department of Education (DepEd), the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and local governments (LGUs) to conduct activities that promote awareness of the writing systems, particularly during “Buwan ng Wika” and similar occasions and events. The conduct of seminars, conferences, conventions, symposia, and other elevant activities on writing systems indigenous to a particular region is also provided for under the bill. The measure also requires government agencies to ensure record-keeping of relevant documents and preservation of oral evidence on the writing systems. It specifically mandates the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) to be the lead agency in promulgating policy guidelines on the promotion of the writing systems. ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Sandiganbayan has affirmed its decision that convicted former Cebu 4th District Rep. Clavel A. Martinez, her son and former Bogo City Mayor Celestino A. Martinez, and six others of graft and malversation in the misappropriation in 2002 of the former legislator’s P24.4 million priority development assistance fund (PDAF) intended for the Girl Scouts of the Philippines (GSP-Cebu Council). In a resolution, the anti-graft court’s sixth division denied their motions for reconsideration as it reiterated that the prosecution was able to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. “In fine, the Court has painstakingly taken a second hard look at the issues raised by accused-movants. Nonetheless, no substantial and compelling reason warrants the modification, much less the reversal, of the Court’s peremptory conclusion,” the court’s resolution said. In their motions, those convicted raised the issue of inordinate delay and stressed that it took more than three years for the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) to find probable cause after the complaint was filed. But the Sandiganbayan said their right to speedy disposition of cases has never been violated. “There was nothing vexatious, capricious, and oppressive which would warrant the precipitate dismissal of the case,” it said. Those convicted also argued that their acts of conspiracy were never really proven beyond reasonable doubt. However, the court also disagreed: “Suffice it to say that the grounds calling for overturning the ‘guilty’ verdict are nothing but réchauffé.” Associate Justice Kevin Narce B. Vivero wrote the resolution with the concurrence of Sixth Division Chairperson Sarah Jane T. Fernandez and Associate Justice Karl B. Miranda. Clavel and Celestino, together with Municipal Treasurer Rhett E. Minguez; and Municipal Accountant Cresencio P. Verdida, GSP officers Rhodariza V. Kilantang and Julieta G. Quino were convicted of all three counts of graft and three counts of malversation. GSP Treasurer Maria Cielo A. Martinez, also the daughter of Clavel, was found guilty in one count each of graft and one malversation. GSP officer Paz C. Radaza was found guilty in two graft and two malversation charges. The case against their co-accused, GSP officer Alejandrita P. Meca, has been ordered archived because she remains at large. The Sandiganbayan found that in 2002, the accused misappropriated Clavel’s PDAF worth P14.4 million intended as financial assistance to the GSP-Cebu for its Anti-Drug Campaign. The funds went instead to Clavel’s Bank of the Philippines (BPI) account, it said. On June 13, 2002, on the same day that the amount was deposited to the GSP Cebu Council, Clavel withdrew a Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) check payable to “cash” worth P7.5 million. Simultaneously, Clavel gave the GSP Cebu Council P400,000, which was deemed as a “donation.” On Sept. 18, 2002, Clavel once again withdrew another LBP check, this time payable to her, worth P7.5 million. She then gave another “donation” worth P200,000 to the GSP Cebu Council.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Supreme Court (SC) has ruled that “all disputes, claims, and controversies, solely between or among executive agencies, including disputes on tax assessments, must perforce be submitted to administrative settlement by the Secretary of Justice or the Solicitor General, as the case may be.” The ruling was issued in the case elevated by the Department of Energy (DOE) before the SC challenging the ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in its petition involving the demand of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for the payment of P18.37 billion in deficiency excise taxes. The taxes sought to be paid by the DOE to the BIR involved transactions on condensates, which the former claimed are classified as liquified natural gas and are thus exempt from excise taxes. On 17 July 2019, the DOE was notified by the BIR that the assessment has become final, executory, and demandable. On Sept. 19, 2019, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued warrants against the DOE. When nothing came out of the talks between the two government agencies, the DOE filed a petition before the CTA. The CTA’s second division dismissed DOE’s petition with a ruling that it is not the proper forum to resolve purely intra-governmental dispute. When the CTA’s second division dismissed DOE’s motion for reconsideration on Feb. 21, 2020, the BIR file a money claim for the assessed deficiency excise tax of P18.37 billion with the Commission on Audit (COA). The DOE elevated the issued before the CTA as a full court. But its appeal was also dismissed on Nov. 4, 2021 prompting it to file a motion for reconsideration which was denied on May 24, 2022. DOE challenged the CTA’s full court decision before the SC. “The CTA correctly steered clear of the case as it lacked jurisdiction over this dispute between the DOE and the BIR,” the SC pointed out in its Aug. 17, 2022 decision written by Associate Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh and made public on Nov. 25. The SC ruled: “WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision, dated 4 November 2021, and the Resolution, dated 24 May 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals en bane in CTA EB No. 2241 (CTA Case No. 10198) are AFFIRMED. SO ORDERED.” The SC also said: “The President, under the Constitution, enjoys the power of control over the entire Executive Department. Given that the President, as Chief Executive, has control over all the agencies in dispute, it is only proper and logical that he first be given a chance to resolve the dispute before resort to the courts. “Only after the President has decided or settled the dispute can the court’s jurisdiction be invoked. Neither the Judiciary, by prematurely taking cognizance of actions which are otherwise subject to administrative discretion, nor the Legislature, by circumscribing such power through legislation, can curtail such exercise of the President’s power of control. “Veritably, the power to tax is legislative in nature, and under our constitutional framework, the power to execute and administer laws, tax laws included, pertains to the Executive. “Pursuant to this design, the Legislature, by enacting the NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code), has yielded the power to assess and collect taxes to the BIR and the CIR, under the supervision and control of the Secretary of Finance. “The Secretary of Finance, in tum, is subject to the control of the President, along with all other executive departments, bureaus, and offices, through which he is expected to faithfully execute all laws. “By the power of control, we mean the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter. “The following conclusions are, thus, inescapable: the President has the power of control over the BIR and the CIR; such power of control authorizes the President to alter, modify, or nullify decisions of the BIR and the CIR; the President can likewise act in the stead of his or her subordinates, and exercise powers directly conferred by law to the BIR and the CIR. “Because of such broad power vested in the President over the acts of subordinates in the Executive Department, it is not only constitutionally infirm, but likewise downright impractical, to allow the Judiciary to take cognizance of a matter which can still be undone, modified, or otherwise subjected to the discretion of the Executive. “It must be clarified that the administrative settlement procedure, as it applies to tax disputes between the BIR and other executive agencies, is not meant to supplant or override the power of Congress to tax. “Foremost, it is circumscribed by the very duty of the Executive to ‘faithfully execute all laws.’ In deciding such conflicts, the Executive is bound to observe tax laws — it cannot wantonly disregard them by haphazardly exempting executive agencies or transactions therefrom nor can it proceed with a pre-determined result in mind, as feared by the petitioner (DOE). “Rather, the process must result in a determination of the most appropriate arrangement or course of action for the agencies involved, after the Executive has taken stock of all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and how they may be reconciled and adhered to in relation to the dispute. “It cannot be utilized as a vehicle for circumventing or disregarding existing laws or justifying illegalities, as these will undoubtedly constitute grave abuse of discretion. “By stepping in to resolve disputes between executive agencies before they are ripe for adjudication, the Chief Executive is not trespassing into the exclusive realm of the Legislature, nor is it arrogating judicial power. He or she is merely positively carrying out his or her mandate to execute laws faithfully. “The Executive’s attempt to reconcile disputes, claims, and controversies stemming from implementation of laws must be viewed as deference to the Legislature, for it is essentially an effort to breathe life and force to laws they have enacted whilst recognizing the complexities attendant to their implementation. “It likewise guards the Judiciary from actions where there are no actual controversies between parties, as there is ultimately one real party-in-interest. Fealty to constitutional mandate demands no less. “Clearly, the CTA En Banc committed no error in denying the petition. The foregoing discussions leave this Court with no other recourse but to deny the Petition….”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Finance (DOF) lauded the decision of the House of Representatives to approve on final reading a proposed measure seeking to impose taxes on single-use plastics. In a statement, Finance Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno said the swift approval of House Bill (HB) 4102 or the Single-use Plastic Bags Tax Act is the country’s contribution to the global movement to reduce pollution. “I thank the House under the leadership of Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez for exercising swift and careful judgment on the approval of the single-use plastic bag tax act,” Diokno said. House approval of single-use plastic tax lauded Last Nov. 14, the lower House approved on third reading HB 4102 that once passed into law, will impose an excise tax of P100 on every kilogram of single-use plastics removed from the place of production or released from custody of the Bureau of Customs. “This is our contribution to the global movement to reduce pollution, while raising revenues needed to manage economic risks and rehabilitate the country—like hitting two birds with one stone,” Diokno said. The price of a pack of labo bags is estimated to increase by around 75 percent during the first year of implementation, with an estimated decline in volume by around 24.7 percent. While the retail price of sando bags will increase by 79.3 percent, which is expected to result in a 26.1-percent decline in volume. The proposed excise tax will increase yearly by four percent beginning 2026, and incremental revenues collected will be allocated to the Department of Natural Resources’ programs for the implementation of Republic Act 9003. A 70 percent assumption in collection efficiency will translate to estimated revenues of P38.06 billion for five years, or 2023 to 2027, of implementation. If passed into law, the bill will address the long-standing issue of plastic waste management by promoting the use of recyclable packaging, and ending the “throw-away culture”. Studies have shown that market-based instruments, such as taxes aimed at discouraging the use of single-use plastics, have proven to be effective in curtailing plastic waste generation. In the ASEAN region, Brunei and Vietnam have already imposed taxes on single-use plastic bags. As a result, Vietnam saw a 23 percent reduction in daily plastic consumption—from 746 tons a day in 2014 to 577 tons in 2017. Meanwhile, Washington DC, San Francisco, and Seattle significantly curbed plastic consumption by 85 percent, 72 percent, and 78 percent, respectively as a result of taxing single-use plastics. According to the World Bank, the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam account for 55 percent to 60 percent of plastic wastes entering the oceans. SUPs were also found to be among the primary wastes collected during DENR coastal clean-up campaigns. The bill was transmitted to the Senate on Nov. 15, 2022.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"“If we really want to stop violence against women and children (VAWC), it starts with us.” Pasig City Mayor Vico said this during his State of the Children Address on Monday, Nov. 28, culminating the celebration of National Children’s Month. Addressing an audience of adults and children at the 2022 Children’s Summit, Sotto emphasized the importance of overcoming fears to speak up against violence and vowing to never be perpetrators of these crimes. “Naiintindihan po natin na madalas po pag may nakikita tayong violence against women and children, ang default po natin ay medyo natatakot tayo na magsalita sa ating kapatid, magulang, o asawa. Normal po na mangamba tayo o matakot. Pero sana isipin po natin na kung gusto natin matigil talaga ito, it starts with us. Una, na tayo mismo, hindi natin gagawin ang mga bagay na iyon (We understand that, usually, when we see violence against women and children, we feel scared to talk to our siblings, parents, or spouses about it. It is normal to feel doubtful and fearful. But if we really want to stop VAWC, it starts with us. First, by committing that we will never do and enact harm [on women and children]),” he said. “Kailangan rin po na pag may nakita o narinig tayo na kapitbahay natin binubugbog ang asawa o anak, sana po ay hindi tayo manahimik lamang. Kung magbibingi-bingihan o magbubulag-bulagan tayo, hindi po matatapos ang problemang ito (When we see or hear of our neighbors abusing their spouse or their child, I hope we do not remain silent. These issues will never be solved if we pretend or insist on being blind or deaf to them),” Sotto added. The city government has mechanisms in place to address VAWC such as the Local Council for the Protection of Children (LCPC) and the Local Council Against Trafficking and VAWC (LCAT-VAWC), all of which are subject to quarterly meetings, discussion, and adjustment of policies. However, the mayor stressed that citizens should not think of curbing VAWC as the job and responsibility solely of the government, social welfare groups, or the police. “Kailangan po ay magtulungan tayo para po itaguyod ang mga karapatan ng ating mga kabataan para siguraduhin na ligtas sila sa kanilang mga kabahayan, paaralan. Ang bawat isa po sa atin dito ay may papel at responsibilidad, lalo na po sa VAWC (We have to work together to uphold the rights of our children to ensure their safety in their homes and schools. Each one of us here has a role to play and a responsibility, especially in regards to VAWC),” Sotto said. VAC in numbers The Pasig City local government continues to strengthen its programs and projects for children’s survival, development, protection, and participation rights, in adherence to the general principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child. Sotto reported there are 102 children in conflict with the law (CICLs), 96 of which are male, logged in Pasig City as of 2022. In 2021, there were 151 CICLs with 62 classified as “children-at-risk.” The number of children being cared for by daycare centers under the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) programs of the local government has decreased, from 6,100 in 2021, to 5,891 in 2022. The beneficiaries of the Supervised Neighborhood Play (SNP) program, has also grown to 1,000 in 2022, compared to just 200 in 2021. The growth of the SNP, a form of daycare program aimed at improving the health of young kids, was attributed to the easing of pandemic restrictions and better conditions this year. Sotto said they are working towards finding and accommodating other children who need daycare services. There are now 536 spaces considered “child-friendly” in the city. There are 20 children being processed for adoption in 2022, same as in 2021, with the help of the CSWD and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). Meanwhile, the city’s rescue processing center responds to more than 60 cases per year. There are 332 kids with “special cases,” pertaining to child abuse and VAWC, that local government bodies have referred to other agencies in 2022, higher than the previous years. Based on the central police station’s records, Sotto said there were 140 VAWC cases from January to September 2022, 68 of which involved minors. Eight of the 68 were CICLs. Sotto said he thinks the increase in the reported cases does not necessarily point to an increase in the instances of VAWC or child abuse in Pasig. Rather, it can be an indication that more VAWC cases are being reported to the authorities. With the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the local government, the CSWD, and the Pasig police have conducted numerous entrapment operations throughout the year to rescue trafficked or abused children in the city, Sotto said. Sotto said the NBI and the CSWD caught and arrested 23 female potential victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, two of whom are minors, last Nov. 25 at a KTV club in Barangay Ugong, Pasig City. He also mentioned the case of a child sold by one of his parents for P45,000 to pay their E-sabong debts last March. With the police, NBI, CSWD, the child was found and is now safe. The three buyers were arrested and jailed. Sotto enumerated other successful multi-sectoral operations that resulted in the rescue of underaged victims from exploitative groups and individuals in Pasig, many of whom were endorsed to childcare centers for physical and psychological support. While they have rescued and intervened in many cases, Sotto said the data is still admittedly low given the severity and frequency of these crimes. “Hinihikayat ko po ang bawat isa na pag may impormasyon tayo, may nalalaman, nabalitaan, o may naririnig tayo – kahit konting ebidensya lang po – ilapit niyo na po sa amin kaagad at asahan niyo po na aaksyunan natin, ipapakulong po natin (If you have any information or knowledge, no matter how small the evidence is, I urge everyone to reach out and report to us immediately. Rest assured we will take action on it, and we will put the perpetrators behind bars),” Sotto said. There may not be very high levels of human and child trafficking in Pasig, but Sotto remained firm in fighting these crimes, saying “one case is too many.” In good hands Despite the areas for improvement in the local government’s efforts to stop cases of VAWC, Sotto said Pasigueño children are “in good hands.” The mayor praised the 11th City council, headed by the “strong-willed and diligent” Vice Mayor Robert “Dodot” Jaworski Jr., stating the essence of the city council’s support in legislating policies for the protection of children and anti-trafficking. In the recent “Child-Friendly Local Gov’t Audit,” Pasig City was recognized for its exemplary performance in the delivery of services for children with an overall rating of 91.07 percent. The city’s LCAT-VAWC was also commended for having the “ideal level of functionality” at the 2022 Local Governance Exemplar Awards. The city government is focusing on two key aspects in their programs for children – awareness and capacity-building. The local government has partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for the Opportunity 2.0 program that aims to “establish the broad alliance of youth workers, advocates, and institutions to deliver services for out-of-school youth (OSYs).” The program has facilitated capacity-building venues for the Pasig Youth Development Alliance (YDA), positive youth development sessions, initial OSY development planning, and pathway orientations wherein OSYs established their own youth leadership circles within the YDA. To curb VAWC in cyberspace, the local government also recently partnered with the Cyber Guardians PH to address online child abuse and exploitation.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Manuel “Lito” Lapid has filed a bill institutionalizing a system of reporting for persons who died of drug overdose. In filing Senate Bill No. 1498, Lapid emphasized the importance of gathering information on drug overdose trends to effectively address the issue on drug overdose. The bill identifies drug overdose as ingestion or application of a drug or other substance in quantities greater than the prescribed or recommended dose. “Drug overdose can be accidental overdoses or intentional misuse. The former occurs when a person consumes a drug by accident or in error,” Lapid said in the explanatory note of his bill. “On the other hand, the latter occurs when a person consumers a drug for its desired effect—it could be to get hight, to harm oneself, or similar reasons. Drug overdose can cause serious adverse consequences and even death,” he said. Lapid said drug overdose, “whether accidental or intentional, can be prevented” and its unintended side effects or even life-threatening symptoms consequences can be avoided. Under the bill, the Department of Health (DOH) Secretary will be mandated to publish a bi-annual findings on nationwide drug overdose trends that reviews overdose death rates and other information to check changes in the caues and rates of fatal drug overdoses. “With this, necessary information will be gathered that would lead to formulation of proper and strategies to be undertaken to effectively address the issue on drug overdose,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"House Speaker Martin Romualdez has filed a bill pushing for the creation of a sovereign wealth fund (SWFs) that will improve investment opportunities for Filipinos. House Bill (HB) No. 6398, if enacted, would establish the Maharlika Wealth Fund (MWF). This would draw resources primarily from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Social Security System (SSS), Land Bank of the Philippines (LandBank), and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) contributions. Romualdez said the government has to “improve investment opportunities, promote productivity-enhancing investments, and ensure that the Philippines becomes an investment destination” in order to achieve the objectives of the Agenda for Prosperity and the eight-point socioeconomic roadmap of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The Speaker added the MWF “will provide for the management, investment, and use of the proceeds of the fund.” “Sovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds typically financed by a country’s surplus revenues or reserves. Governments invest these funds in an array of both real and financial assets to stabilize national budgets, create savings for their citizens, or promote economic development,” he noted. Under the measure, the GSIS, SSS, LandBank, and DBP will be given the opportunity “to ensure their respective funds’ optimal asset allocation as well as ensure that resources are efficiently channeled to investments that will provide the most value not only to the participating GFIs, but also to the country.” Co-authors of the bill are House Majority Leader Manuel Jose “Mannix” M. Dalipe, senior Deputy Majority Leader Sandro Marcos, Tingog Party-list Reps. Yedda Marie Romualdez and Jude Acidre, and Marikina City Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo. The proposed MWF is patterned after the sovereign wealth funds of 49 countries, including Singapore, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and East Timor. The Speaker cited Singapore and Indonesia that both successfully used their sovereign wealth funds. He said Singapore’s SWFs provide the financial means for the city-state “to manage its foreign reserves, defend itself and protect its sovereignty without compromising its domestic program, and augment its land-limited economic space with global investments.” On the other hand, Indonesia’s SWF has attracted foreign investors to jointly capitalize its SWF to bring in much-needed investments in such sectors as transportation, including airports, supply chains, logistics, digital infrastructure, the green economy, healthcare services, amd the financial sector, among others. “As the Philippines secures its place not only as the Rising Star of Asia but as a real economic leader in the Asia Pacific, the creation of the MWF becomes imperative,” Romualdez stressed. He said the MWF would also adhere to the Santiago Principles of the International Forum on Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) to ensure transparency and accountability. Under the bill, the envisioned MWF would have a governing board, composed of nominees of the contributing GFIs, which would be in charge of managing the fund. The board would include two independent directors.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Most Filipinos said the country is headed in the right direction under the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., according to an independent survey conducted by the OCTA Research Group. The 4th quarter of 2022 Tugon ng Masa survey that was conducted on Oct. 23-27 asked 1,200 adult respondents nationwide: “Based on the policies and programs presented and implemented by the current administration, do you think the country is leading in the right way?” OCTA’s survey results showed that 85 percent of Filipino adults said the country is headed in the right direction, while only 6 percent thought otherwise. Among the major areas, those in the Visayas registered the highest agreement that the country is moving in the right direction, with 91 percent. Eighty-seven percent of Filipinos in Balance Luzon, or Luzon outside Metro Manila, and 84 percent in Mindanao think the country is in the right direction. Meanwhile, only 70 percent of adult Filipinos in Metro Manila think the country is moving in the right direction. By socio-economic classes, 86 percent of Filipinos belonging to the Class D or “masa” think the Philippines is headed in the right direction. About 81 percent of Filipinos belonging to Class E or “poorest” class and 79 percent belonging to Class ABC or “upper-to-middle” class say that the country is in the right direction. Among age groups, the highest agreement that the country is in the right direction was shown by those 75 years old and above, with 98 percent. It was followed by 18- to 24-year-olds and 45- to 54-year-olds with 90 percent each, and 55- to 64-year-olds with 81 percent. About 80 percent of those aged 25-34 and 35-44 said that the country is headed in the right direction with the new administration. Meanwhile, only 78 percent of the 65- to 74-year-olds said the country is in the right direction.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Two House committees on Monday, Nov. 28, created a technical working group (TWG) to hammer out the details for a substitute bill that would consolidate 35 proposed measures on the creation of a Department of Water Resources (DWR) to improve the country’s water management and oversee the critical supply of fresh water.House Committees on Government Reorganization and Public Works and Highways, headed by Surigao del Sur 1st District Rep. Romeo Momo, led the initial deliberation during a joint committee hearing where Albay 2nd District Rep. and House Ways and Means chair Joey Salceda was named TWG chair.Momo said he “strongly supports” the “immediate passage” of the bill as he underscored the importance of the DWR, of which a substitute bill that consolidated several measures was already approved in the 18th Congress, because water is a public utility that “needs to be regulated.”  “The DWR will serve as primary national agency responsible for policy formulation, planning, coordination, implementation, and monitoring of the development and management of the country’s water resources,” he explained.“The creation of a new department will set policies and implement structural reforms on water management that will address various issues, including the critical supply of fresh water,” Momo said, adding that this will also ensure affordable water for Filipinos.  The bill, Salceda said, would aim to “ensure and accelerate universal access to water supply and sanitation services, to encourage responsible private sector participation, fostering and prioritizing infrastructure and public works that adopt innovative solutions and international best practices to address the challenges of climate change; and to declare all water and water treatment infrastructure projects as projects imbued with national interest.”  The TWG would aim to resolve the following pending issues: attachment of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) to the proposed department, the inclusion of sewage systems under the jurisdiction of the department, and the inclusion of flood control planning in the department’s functions.The veteran lawmaker lamented that only 43 percent of the country’s population has access to level 3 water supply, even as the country only uses 21 percent of its total potential water supply.  “We generate some 2200 mm of annual rainfall, nearly thrice what God gives China. So, we don’t have a water scarcity issue. We have a water management issue,” he explained.  He also pointed out the highly unequal access to water, especially across income classes.  Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor, however, pointed out the vagueness of the proposed bills in terms of identifying the implementing agency.  “The 35 bills as they are filed are very broad in themselves,” he said, adding that sewerage and treatment of water should be added in the substitute bill.  The lawmaker also suggested that the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), and the private sector provide inputs of what they think should be the priority measures and priority projects of the bill that need funding.  NEDA, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), the Maynilad Water Services, and Manila Water all support the creation of the DWR.  Saying that NEDA is at the “forefront” of the push to create a DWR since 1999, NEDA Assistant Secretary Roderick Planta said that they will look at the House Bills “as a starting point.”  A representative from the DBM also agreed with Defensor about the role of NWRB in the creation of a separate department for water resources because it currently handles the country’s water resource management.  DPWH Assistant Secretary Anne Sharlyne Lapuz, however, raised concerns about the overlapping functions of the DPWH and the DWR.  While the department recognizes that “there is a disjointed governance with respect to the management of the water resources of the country,” she pointed out that flood control and drainage management, which are proposed functions of the DWR in the proposals, are being handled by “scattered units or bureaus” in the DPWH.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Monday, November 28 said the Philippine government is now doubling all efforts to rescue some 31 more individuals who are said to be victims of human trafficking in Myanmar. Hontiveros, citing the testimony of “Rita” one of the human trafficking victims who was lured to accept a job in Thailand but ended up forced to work and dupe people to cryptocurrency investment scams, about 31 Filipinos were still left behind in Myanmar. “They have a quota and if they couldn’t deliver, especially among the 31 left behind, Rita knows they are being hurt and all of them who were not able to deliver on their quotas were subject to stress, threatened to be made to do 1,000 push ups to lift gallons water, hit by electric rods, and even stabbed to death,” Hontiveros said in an interview on ABS-CBN. “Rita said even the women were threatened that their corpses would just be left somewhere out in the open when they die. Really, really, very, very abusive working conditions,” she said. Rita, was one of the 12 persons, who were the first batch to be rescued by the government. “We only know of those 31 others. Hindi pa natin alam yan ang pinaiimbestiga ko sa ating mga awtoridad and thanks to our DMW, sabi nila nag-iimbestiga na sila (We don’t know yet the exact number, that’s what I’m investigating with our authorities. And thanks to our Department of Migrant Workers), they said they are investigating. We don’t know how many Filipinos are in this predicament,” she said. Hontiveros reiterated her call for the Department of Foreign Affairs to further step up to rescue the other remaining Filipinos by calling on their counterparts to fully cooperate with Philippine authorities. “Tayo at ang Myanmar parehong mga myembro sa (We and Myanmar are both memberes of the) ASEAN, and I already did make a call sa DFA among other government agencies,” she said. “Again, I thank the DFA for helping Rita cross the border back to Thailand and meet her there. DFA could open up this subject of discussion with Myanmar counterparts),” she said. Hontiveros also said Facebook has also communicated to her office when they read the news and saw the social media posts of what happened to “Rita” and her friends. “They communicated with my office and asked for the information about these Facebook pages. The pages Filipinos in Myanmar, Filipinos in Thailand, and POGO secret files and they said they would take action on this,” she said. “Nanawagan din ako sa ibang mga (I’m also asking other) platforms, that Rita said have been used. WhatsApp, Telegram even dating and professional apps like Linkedin. And of course, our authorities, Bureau of Immigration (BI), that they would really look out for this. “Because dumadaan sa kanila eh, palabas at paloob (it passes through them) . So they are also a line of defense for our nationals,” she added.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Answering the call of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to rightsize the national government, a House panel on Monday, Nov. 28, approved the substitute bill for all 15 proposals that aim to improve public service delivery. During its regular meeting, the House Committee on Government Reorganization, led by its chairperson, Bukidnon 2nd District Rep. Jonathan Keith Flores, tackled the committee report and passed the substitute bill for 15 proposed measures that would begin the process of “analyzing and designing the appropriate role, mandate, structure, functions, size, systems and processes of government agencies in order to ensure effective, responsive, and efficient service delivery.” The panel consolidated House Bills (HBs) 12, 2423, 2787, 2885, 3096, 3227, 3385, 3473, 3529, 3539, 4015, 4086, 4120, 4411, and 4816, which are authored by House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Reps. Richard Gomez of Leyte 4th District, Patrick Michael Vargas of Quezon City 5th District, Margarita Ignacia Nograles of PBA Party-list, Teodorico Haresco Jr. of Aklan 2nd District, Michael Romero of 1-PACMAN Party-list, Keith Micah ‘Atty. Mike’ Tan of Quezon 4th District, Paolo Duterte of Davao City 2st District, Edvic Yap of ACT-CIS Party-list, Luis Raymund ‘LRay’ Villafuerte Jr. of Camarines Sur 2nd District, Gus Tambunting of Parañaque City 2nd District, Stella Luz Quimbo of Marikina City 2nd District, Virgilio Lacson of Manila Teachers Party-list, Joseph Gilbert Violago of Nueva Ecija 2nd District, and Flores. The substitute bill, entitled “An Act to Rightsizing the National Government to Improve Public Service Delivery and Appropriating Funds Therefor,” will also include the committee-approved amendments and the results of the scheduled strategic review. Budget Undersecretary Wilford Wong presented the technical review of the draft substitute bill. His presentation included the proposed revisions to the bill’s definition of terms “to ensure clarity on the use of terminologies,” such as abolition, affected personnel, consolidation, deactivation, detailed rightsized organizational structure, merger, placement, rightsized organizational structure, rightsizing, staffing pattern, and transfer. Quimbo, the author of one of the proposed bills, clarified the participation of the public and private sector in the rightsizing of government agencies and bureaus. “This means outsourcing, right? That is what you mean by engage . . . I just want to clarify when you right size that means certain functions can be outsourced from the private sector,” she asked. “Is that the correct appreciation? If that is correct, I think the word outsource should actually be used,” the lawmaker added. To this, Wong answered that Quimbo’s observation will be taken into consideration. But the lawmaker also raised concerns on what she called the “most controversial” of the Congress’ rightsizing initiative. “Ano gagawin mo sa (What are you going to do with the) welfare ng employees na matatanggal (of employees who will be removed),” she asked. Flores replied that another provision in the law “provides also that they would be also part of a pool and retrained and retooled by the Civil Service.” Government employees have been against the proposed rightsizing of government, but Marcos already defended his position by saying it will put government resources “where it really matters, or where it is more urgent.” The DBM, headed by Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, earlier expressed support for the President’s thrust for a lean, efficient, and responsive government workforce.

Manila Bulletin,"The capability of the Philippine Navy (PN) to build its own vessels may no longer be a far-fetched idea. In fact, it might happen in two years’ time. Rear Adm. Toribio Adaci Jr., PN Flag Officer in Command (FOIC), said the Navy is eyeing to start the construction of three Shaldag Mark V fast attack interdiction craft-missile (FAIC-M) in 2024. These vessels will be part of the nine units of Acero-class patrol gunboats that were acquired by the PN from Israel in 2019 for P10 billion. These will be assigned to the Littoral Combat Force like their predecessor, the 12 multi-purpose attack craft (MPACs). On Monday, Nov. 28, the PN commissioned into service the first two pairs of the Acero-class patrol gunboats, BRP Nestor Acero (PG-901) and BRP Lolinato To-Ong (PG-902). Four units will be delivered by the manufacturer, Israeli Shipyard Ltd., in 2023 while the remaining three units will be built at a PN shipyard in Cavite City in 2024. “The last three boats shall be assembled in Cavite City. We have our naval shipyard in Cavite and what they are doing, they are trying to rehabilitate this old facility to make it a modern one and designed for these types of vessels,” Adaci said. “In that way, our people can learn how they do it, maintain these Acero-class boats, and that will be the start of our transfer of technology. It is a portion of our Self-Reliance Defense Program (SRDP),” he added. Aside from the nine purchased units in 2019, Adaci revealed that the PN is also proposing for the acquisition of 15 more Acero-class patrol gunboats. “We are planning to get 15 additional Acero-class boats on top of these nine boats,” he said. “It’s a proposal from us. That would meet the requirements for patrolling the seas of our country,” he said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Listen to people with “sensible legal advice”. This was SAGIP Party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta’s advice to Senator Risa Hontiveros following their tit-for-tat during the Nov. 23 Commission on Appointments (CA) hearing wherein the panel deliberated on Commission on Audit (COA) Chairman Gamaliel Cordoba’s confirmation. In an interview over state-run Radyo Pilipinas over the weekend, Marcoleta recalled how tempers flared between him and Hontiveros as the lady solon “belabored” on the topic of shuttered television and radio network ABS-CBN in what should’ve been a discussion on Cordoba’s credentials as COA chief. Cordoba is a former commissioner of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), which ultimately ordered the closure of ABS-CBN in 2020 after its franchise expired. Consequently, the House of Representatives, which Marcoleta was also a member of at that time, junked applications to grant the media giant a new franchise. Marcoleta said he particularly didn’t like it when Hontiveros claimed that there’s “continuing injustice” in the ABS-CBN case. “Parang na insulto naman ako. Dalawang taon na nakararaan, nagpasya na ang mababang kapulungan, ‘Huwag siyang bigyan na ng prangkisa sapagkat na-establish naman na ang napakaraming mga paglabag’ (I kind of felt insulted. It’s been two years and the lower chamber has spoken, ‘The franchise will not be approved because a lot of violations were established),” the outspoken lawyer-solon said. “Pagkatapos, kumambiyo naman siya, ‘Eh yan po ang aking hamak na opinyon, hindi naman po ako abugado. Eh kung aaminin mo na hindi ka abugado, makinig ka naman dun sa mga sensible naman na legal advice (She shifted gears afterwards and said, ‘That’s just my mere opinion, I’m not a lawyer. If you’ll admit that you’re not a lawyer, then listen to those who have sensible legal advice),” Marcoleta said. He further noted in the interview the time constraints that the CA now has to deal with stemming from the unproductive hearings. It can be recalled that the SAGIP congressman was among the most vocal oppositors to ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal during the high-profile public hearings in the House of Representatives over two years ago. Marcoleta also disagreed with Hontiveros’s take that ABS-CBN’s closure has hurt free speech. “Kung ikakapit mo yung free speech, parang gusto niyang sabihin, ‘Hindi na bale yung mga violations na yan basta magiging pasilidad siya ng free speech’ (If you’re including the issue of free speech, it’s like she’s saying, ‘Never mind those violations, for as long as it becomes a facility for free speech),” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, has renewed his appeal for Filipinos to get vaccinated and boosted as well as the governmen continues its vigilance against the threat of COVID-19. Go made the call as health authorities detected the “highly transmissible and immune-evasive COVID-10 Omicron BQ.1 sublineage in the country. The Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed 14 new cases of BQ.1. “Huwag ho tayong maging kumpiyansa. Habang nandiriyan po ang COVID (dahil) nagmu-mutate po ito (Let’s not be confident. While there is COVID (because) it is mutating,” Go said in a recent interview. According to health experts, the other Omicron subvariants, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 are said to be more contagious and immune-evasive. At this, Go said Filipinos who remain unvaccinated should get innoculated and boost their immunity as soon as possible, as research shows that vaccinated people experience fewer severe symptoms from the virus. “Paigtingin po natin ang ating pagpapabakuna. Ang bakuna po ang tanging susi o solusyon para unti-unti na tayong makabalik sa ating normal na pamumuhay. ‘Pag qualified na ho kayo sa booster, magpabooster na po tayo kaysa naman po masayang itong mga bakuna at nae-expire po (Let’s intensify our vaccination. The vaccine is the only key or solution so that we can gradually return to our normal lifestyle. When you are qualified for the booster, we will get a booster instead of these vaccines going to waste and expiring),” “Gamitin po ito, suyurin po ang mga hindi pa bakunado (Please use it, please check those who have not been vaccinated),” he stressed. He said Filipinos should not be content with merely receiving initial vaccination shots because an additional booster dose, once they were eligible for it, would provide them with an additional layer of protection against COVID-19. “Ang baba po ng ating booster vaccination rate, sa ngayon — 26% lang po sa 1st dose. Ang dami pang hindi nagpapabakuna. Huwag ho kayong maging kumpiyansa, nakikiusap po kami. Huwag ho tayong maging kumpiyansa (Our booster vaccination rate is low, so far — only 26 percent for the 1st dose. There are still many who do not vaccinate. Don’t be too confident, we beg you. Let’s not be confident),” said Go.  “Hindi naman natin alam kung gaano kalakas ito, deadly ba itong (bagong variant). Ngunit habang nandiriyan si COVID, delikado. Huwag maging kumpiyansa (We don’t know how strong it is, is it (new variant) deadly. But while COVID is around, it’s dangerous. Don’t be confident),” he added.” There are now 13 cases that were discovered in the National Capital Region, CALABARZON, Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, and Central Visayas. The DOH said these cases amounted to 0.03% of the total number of Omicron subvariants in the country. The August COVID-19 wave that hit the country may have been caused by BQ.1, a sublineage of BA.5 that branches off from Omicron, according to the Philippine Genome Center.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The implementation of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) next year is expected to improve the country’s Internet speed. Thus, said House Speaker Martin Romualdez who noted that P1.5 billion worth of funds have been allocated to the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) project under the proposed 2023 national budget. “The Internet is a critical social service nowadays, as it is deeply entrenched in the way we live. We use the Internet for education, for delivering and availing social services, for our businesses, and for almost every facet of our lives,” Romualdez said in a statement Monday, Nov. 28. Romualdez–Leyte’s 1st district representative–said the P1.5 billion allocation to the NBP is part of the P77-billion institutional amendments made by the lower chamber to augment the budget for education, health, transportation, and other critical social services. Incidentally, the Bicameral Conference Committee meetings between the House of Representatives and Senate on the proposed P5.268-trillion General Appropriations Bill (GAB) for 2023 began last Friday. A member of the House contingent to the bicam, Committee on Appropriations Chairman and Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co, said for NBP allocation will go a long way in jumpstarting the program meant to provide the backbone for Internet service in all government agencies nationwide. Co said that currently, there are areas in the country that have no Internet service due to inaccessibility. “We can now use the bandwidth given by Facebook once the DICT conducts the rollout of national broadband infrastructure, which will now be finally funded,” the Bicolano said. “He was talking about the earlier agreement forged by DICT, Facebook, and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), wherein Facebook agreed to provide the Philippine government with spectrum equivalent to at least two million megabits per second (Mbps) once the Internet infrastructure has been established.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate debates and discussions on the floor and during committee hearings show the true essence of democracy, Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva said today. Villanueva said he admires his colleagues in the 24-member Senate because they are always open to discussions and debates. “This will ensure that your Senate is doing its job in making our democracy work. The more voices are heard and considered, the more our policy options become clear and relevant,” he pointed out. “For instance, Senator (Ronald) ‘Bato’ dela Rosa recently conducted a committee hearing and listened to all the arguments regarding his proposed measure decriminalizing illegal drugs. We laud the former PNP (PhilippIne National Police) chief and now colleague in the Senate for his openness to various positions and recommendations,” he said. Villanueva also said that taking into account the positions and recommendations of various stakeholders during his committee hearings in the past helped him improve his bills. “As Majority Leader, it’s our goal to level up discussions and debates in the Senate. I admire our colleagues for their open-mindedness, especially on issues that have direct daily impact on our people’s lives,” Villanueva said. Villanueva noted that debates and open discussions are critical as the Senate works towards passing the Marcos’ administration’s priority measures, including his principally authored bill, which seeks to institutionalize the National Employment Recovery Strategy, to which the President showed full support, during the Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC) meeting last month. “The first committee hearings on the Creation of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention bill and the Medical Reserve Corps bill are done, while preliminary discussions on the Condonation of unpaid amortizations and interest on loans of agrarian reform beneficiaries bill have already begun,” he said. Villanueva added that the active participation of the senators during the budget deliberations helped ensure that the 2023 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) would pass on time and cater to the immediate needs of the country. “Lawmaking is not just about numbers. This is why we encourage discussions and debates because at the end of the day we all agree to get the best solution to all our woes with one common goal which is to protect the best interest of our people,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"San Juan City Mayor and newly-elected Metro Manila Council (MMC) President Francis Zamora said the council is ramping up its efforts in mitigating the traffic in the National Capital Region (NBCR) caused by the holiday rush. During the Nov. 26 joint session of the MMC and the Regional Development Council (RDC) which he co-chairs, Zamora enumerated the steps the MMC will take to ease the traffic woes of the public. These include the adjustment of mall hours, extending the duty of traffic enforcers, and the suspension of road construction works. On Nov. 14, mall owners and operators in Metro Manila have adjusted their operating hours as part of the measures to manage the expected traffic congestion during the Christmas season from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. The adjusted mall hours will be in effect until Jan. 6 of next year. “We have to implement remedial measures to reduce traffic congestion. The new mall operating hours were agreed during a consultative meeting with major stakeholders,” Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Romando Artes said. Based on the agreement, Artes said mall-wide sales will only be allowed during weekends while deliveries will be from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. only. Exempted from the regulation are deliveries of perishable goods, restaurants serving breakfast, and groceries. Zamora also said the MMC has also postponed the demolition of the bridge in Altura, Sta. Mesa to give way to the construction of the NLEX-SLEX Connector. “Yung NLEX-SLEX Connector matutuloy po yan ngunit ang decommissioning ng Magsaysay Bridge ay sa Dec. 26 pa, so ibig sabihin, magagamit pa ang tulay hanggang sa Dec. 25, papalagpasin lang ang Pasko (The NLEX-SLEX Connector project will still continue but the decommissioning of the Magsaysay Bridge will be on Dec. 26. This means the bridge can still be used until Dec. 25),” Zamora said. Safety protocols Aside from introducing steps to mitigate holiday traffic, Zamora also urged the public to still observe the minimum public health and safety protocols against Covid-19 amid the easing of some restrictions such as the voluntary wearing of face masks and the increase in capacity of businesses. On Oct. 27, the mayor said that the public must already know their own individual risks and learn to decide by themselves following the lifting of the mandatory wearing of face masks indoors as part of the national government’s efforts to boost the country’s economy that has been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The operative word here is ‘voluntary.’ No one is forcing anyone not to wear a mask. So, we have the option if we feel that the indoor area we are in is safe then we have the option not to wear a mask. If we feel that it’s crowded and there are too many people and it’s not safe, then we have the option or choice to wear a mask,” Zamora said in an interview with ANC. “So, I believe that we are being given a choice. This is something that I honestly appreciate because there are some instances where you may be indoors but it is not a high-risk area so I can opt not to wear my mask. But once I enter, for instance, a mall that is filled with a lot of people, I will choose to wear my mask,” he added.    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"San Juan City Mayor and newly-elected Metro Manila Council (MMC) President Francis Zamora said on Saturday, Nov. 26, that the council has approved the resolution allocating more than P9 billion operational budget for the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for 2023. During the joint session between the MMC and the Regional Development Council (RDC) which he also co-chairs, Zamora said the MMC has agreed to the P9,673,918,000 budget for MMDA’s operation for the following year. It has also approved the P100 million Supplemental Budget for a Particular Program / Activity / Projects and for Other Purposes of MMDA. “Yan po ay hinati natin sa mga proyekto depende po sa request at pangangailangan. Tayo ay nagpa-prioritize dahil medyo naapektuhan ng pandemya yung budget, medyo nabawasan (This will be properly divided among our projects depending on the request and need. We are going to prioritize because our budget has decreased due to the Covid-19 pandemic),” MMDA Chairman Romando Artes said. “Yung budget ng MMDA, this is the budget for calendar year 2023, pero papasok pa sa Congress so maaring magbago pa ang budget (This proposed MMDA budget is for calendar year 2023 but this will still go through Congress so it may still change),” Zamora said. Single-ticketing system During the session, Zamora said the MMC is eyeing to introduce a single-ticketing system in Metro Manila to ease the burden on motorists. The project aims for a unified ticketing system with the same amount charged for penalties for several common traffic violations in all Metro Manila LGUs, with the MMDA and the Land Transportation Office (LTO) immediately tagged in the digital records to make sure drivers cannot renew their licenses or declare them lost just to evade payment. The system also aims to make it easier for the penalties to be paid via payment centers all over the country. “Ang ticket sa San Juan kahit umuwi sa Bicol, kahit andun siya, pwede bayaran ang multa na dapat sa San Juan (The ticket in San Juan, even if the violator is currently in Bicol, he/she may still settle the fine that should be paid in San Juan),” Zamora explained. He added that they are also considering making the fines for traffic violations among all 17 cities in Metro Manila uniform. “Kasi, iba iba ang aming kasalukuyang ordinansa. Iba ang multa sa iba’t ibang klaseng violations. We have to discuss sa lahat ng mayor ay sasang-ayon na halaga ng multa sa iba’t ibang klaseng violations ay magiging parehas (Cities currently have different ordinances. We all have different fines for various violations. We still have to discuss this with all mayors so that we can all agree on having uniform fines among cities),” Zamora said. The MMC said it will once again convene on Dec. 9 to discuss the two proposals because not all mayors were present during the joint session. “We are hoping this will help us ease the traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Of course, several other steps must be undertaken for a more holistic and progressive approach to solve the traffic woes in the National Capital Region and this is where the MMC and the RDC come in,” Zamora said.

Manila Bulletin,"SAGIP Party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta thinks that a Cabinet official of the Marcos administration might get bypassed by the Commission on Appointments (CA) due to lack of time. In an interview over state-run Radyo Pilipinas over the weekend, Marcoleta noted that the CA, which he is a member of, is running out of time to confirm the appointments of some of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s handpicked Cabinet officials. This, after the CA’s hearing on Commission on Audit (COA) Chairman Gamaliel Cordoba’s confirmation last Nov. 23 went nowhere and thus had to be suspended. With Congress scheduled to go on a five-week holiday break starting Dec. 17, the CA would likely be forced to hold confirmations on multiple Cabinet officials per hearing. “Ang resonable diyan, ang pinaka-maximum sana, dalawa sa isang araw pero mapipilitan silang tigta-tatlo, apat (The reasonable thing to do, or the maximum would be to deliberate on two officials per day, but they will be forced to have three to four on deck),” he said. “Hindi kakayanin yan…Kaya palagay ko merong maba-bypass dito (That’s undoable…that’s why I think someone will get bypassed). Automatic bypass,” added Marcoleta. A Cabinet official who fail to get confirmed by the CA while Congress is in session is deemed bypassed and would need to be reappointment by the executive. “Pero wala tayong magagawa…kailangan nating busisiin naman. Huwag naman yung mabilisan na para namang wholesale deliberation, mahirap naman yun (But we can’t do anything about that…we need to scrutinize them. We don’t want hastened, wholesale deliberationsl),” noted Marcoleta, a former deputy speaker. The CA is composed of several members of the House and Senate, which in turn make up Philippine Congress. Among those awaiting confirmation by the panel according to Marcoleta are Deparment of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Alfredo Pascual, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Raphael Lotilla, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director-General Arsenio Balisacan, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan Uy, Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Secretary Susan Ople, and Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) Secretary Jose Acuzar.

Manila Bulletin,"Maritime law enforcment agencies from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should enhance their collaboration to win the fight against transnational crimes at sea and preserve the stability in the region. Adm. Artemio Abu, Commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), raised the suggestion to his foreign counterparts during the ASEAN Coast Guard and Maritime Law Enforcement Agencies Meeting 2022 in Bali, Indonesia last week. “Information sharing on smuggling, illegal drugs transport, human trafficking, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is crucial in the region’s efforts to maintain law and order at sea,” he said. During the meeting, Abu and his counterparts from Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam reaffirmed their pledge to serve as “driving forces in advocating peace, security, safety, stability, prosperity, and friendship in the ASEAN region.” Abu said the maritime leaders also recognized the need to enhance mutual trust, strengthen the connection, and improve cooperation among Coast Guards in upholding regional maritime security and maritime safety. Further, the Coast Guard chiefs also agreed to initiate more meetings, capacity-development initiatives, and exchanges of visit “to boost the association’s information sharing mechanisms and confidence-building measures.” “This initiative is timely and important in light of the current challenges in the region’s maritime environment. We are optimistic that the ASEAN cooperation will translate into a strong commitment to counter illegal activities at sea and protect the marine environment,” Abu stressed. The Coast Guard chiefs then signed the “ASEAN Coast Guard Declaration” to cap off the meeting. The declaration formalized their commitment to “promote peaceful, safe, and secure ASEAN seas.” Held from Nov. 22 to 23, the meeting was organized by the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency (Bakamla) and co-sponsored by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Global Maritime Crime Program. Next year, the PCG will host the Expert’s Working Group Meeting of ASEAN Coast Guards in Manila.  ",0

The Manila Times,"The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) said it welcomes the recent announcement by Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla that UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz, a forensic doctor, will visit the country next year. ICHRP Chairperson Peter Murphy said as Special Rapporteur on an extrajudicial, summary, and arbitrary executions, Tidball-Binz's visit would be an important next step in the process of seeking justice for the thousands of victims of extrajudicial killings under the previous Duterte government, as well as the current Marcos government. As reported by Investigate PH, in which Philippine forensic expert Dr. Rachel Fortun served as one of the expert witnesses, thousands of extrajudicial and arbitrary killings allegedly took place under the term of former president Rodrigo Duterte. The Philippine National Police admit to over 6,600 such killings. But despite the abundant evidence that these killings took place, only 25 police officers have been charged so far in relation to the war on drugs, according to Remulla's report to member states of the Human Rights Council on November 14. Other targets of alleged EJKs under Duterte's war on dissent were human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, indigenous leaders, peasants, and labor leaders. Even under the new Marcos administration, these killings continue: radio journalist Percival ""Percy Lapid"" Mabasa was killed in a plot allegedly orchestrated by a senior government official recently. ""Given this recent announcement, we reiterate our call to the Marcos administration for an open, transparent, and thorough investigation of these crimes, and justice for all victims and their families. This means investigation and prosecution of all perpetrators of such crimes, and an end to the state of impunity which has allowed so many members of the police force to avoid prosecution so far,"" Murphy said. ""ICHRP also echoes the call of at least ten Human Rights Council member states to the Philippine government to re-join the International Criminal Court and cooperate with the ICC's ongoing investigation into the crime against humanity of murder during the so-called war on drugs,"" he added.

The Manila Times,"MV Maria Estrella del Mar, a ship recently purchased by St. Anthony's College (SAC) for its Maritime Education Department, was deployed on its maiden voyage carrying supplies for towns in Antique that are badly hit by Super Typhoon ""Paeng."" The vessel berthed at the San Jose, Antique Port last November 14, Monday, from its homeport in Iloilo. It was loaded with supplies and other economic needs for Antique where land transportation was blocked by wrecked bridges and roads. The ship, a three-decker passenger-cargo vessel of 969.84 gross tonnage, is being positioned by SAC as a response to the challenge of the European Maritime Safety Agency to produce highly skilled seafarers. While functioning commercially as authorized by the Maritime Industry Authority, it will also house the Hanas-Dagat Visayas (HDV) maritime cadetship program. The HDV provides maritime cadets from the BS Marine Engineering and BS Marine Transportation program, a local, affordable and suitably-duration On-Board Training program required by the Commission on Higher Education and Marina for the graduation of students from BSMT and BSMarE. The MV Maria Estrella del Mar and the HDV are SAC's unique and practical response to the challenges of the maritime industry as it is the first of its kind sailing commercially while dedicated to training cadets. The training ships currently present in the country and Southeast Asia are of the kind of berthed laboratories. Seeking to serve Antique and the nearby provinces, the MV Maria Estrella del Mar is also envisioning an active role in rejuvenating sea commerce from the province, and opening more economic and tourism routes.

The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. called on Filipinos to be vigilant in defending the country from societal problems and other factors that endanger its liberty, as the nation celebrates the 159th birth anniversary of Andres Bonifacio Wednesday. Marcos honored Bonifacio by laying a wreath at the Monument Circle in Caloocan City for the commemoration of the birth anniversary of the father of Philippine revolution. ""Today, we cherish the freedoms we hold with even greater fervor as we commemorate the birth anniversary of Gat Andres Bonifacio. His spirit lives on in the stories we tell and use to build on his legacy, breathing new life into his words with our sense of duty and patriotism,"" Marcos said. ""It is through the bold ideas of the Father of the Philippine Revolution that our heroic ancestors were able to muster the will and the courage to fight their oppressors thereby paving the way to our motherland's eventual emancipation,"" he added. The President said it was Bonifacio's deeds ""that provided the impetus for our collective liberation, which we are challenged to preserve and protect amidst these trying times."" ""The shackles that once held our forebears may no longer constrain us, but we must remain vigilant in protecting our country from social ills and other elements that threaten our liberties,"" Marcos said. ""I call on my fellow Filipinos to honor Bonifacio's life of extraordinary selflessness by becoming dutiful and law-abiding citizens who will contribute towards a brighter and freer future for all Filipinos,"" he added.

The Manila Times,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go, chairman of both the Senate Committees on Health and Demography and Sports, on Monday, November 28, vowed to continue his pursuit of enhancing the country's health care system and grassroots sports programs as he provided aid to barangay tanod (village watchmen) and barangay kagawad (village councilors) in Caloocan City. Go was joined by fellow senators Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa, Francis Tolentino and Maria Imelda Josefa ""Imee"" Marcos, as well as Caloocan City Second District Rep. Mitch Cajayon-Uy and Mayor Along Malapitan. Barangay officials across Caloocan City were also present during the visit. In his message to residents, Go explained how a well-established grassroots sports program can help improve the health and well-being of Filipinos. He said encouraging the youth to participate in sports will help them avoid engaging in risky vices such as illegal drug use, which not only puts their health but also their lives and communities at risk. As part of his commitment to improve access to quality health care services nationwide, Go had primarily authored and sponsored the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which became Republic Act (RA) 11463. RA 11463 aims to give poor and indigent patients convenient access to medical assistance programs offered by relevant agencies. To date, there are 153 Malasakit Centers that have helped millions of Filipinos across the country. The Malasakit Center in Caloocan City is located at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital. Go is also pushing for the establishment of Super Health Centers (SHCs) across the country to make health services more accessible to Filipinos, especially in far-flung communities. Citing that 307 SHCs are funded under the 2022 national budget, he said these centers will offer basic health services, such as database management, outpatient, birthing, isolation, diagnostic (laboratory: X-ray, ultrasound), pharmacy, and ambulatory surgical unit. Other available services are eye, ear, nose and throat service; oncology centers; physical therapy and rehabilitation center; and telemedicine, where remote diagnosis and treatment of patients will be done. In Caloocan City, there will be an SHC to be strategically located in Barangay Deparo. During their visit, Go and his team conducted a distribution activity at the Caloocan High School. They handed out grocery packs, vitamins, masks, shirts and meals to 960 barangay frontliners, and gave select individuals umbrellas, new pairs of shoes, watches, cellular phones and bicycles. Others also received balls for basketball and volleyball to promote sports in the community. Moreover, representatives from the Department of Social Welfare and Development extended separate financial assistance to qualified beneficiaries. During the activity, Go also explained the reason for his support for the postponement of the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE). President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. recently signed RA 11935, which reset the BSKE from December 5 this year to the last Monday of October 2023. The elections will then be conducted every three years thereafter. To further promote the welfare of barangay officials, Go filed Senate Bill (SB) 197 which would provide for a Magna Carta for Barangay. He said barangay officials should get comparable benefits to those provided to other government employees in recognition of their efforts to serve their constituents. The senator also filed SB 427 which would mandate provision of allowances and incentives to barangay health workers. If the measure is passed into law, a monthly allowance will be provided to all barangay health workers. These workers will also be entitled to security of tenure and other benefits and privileges. The senator thanked local authorities for ensuring that their constituents are not left behind in the path toward recovery. Also serving as vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Go was instrumental in the construction of multipurpose buildings in Caloocan City. Prior to the activity, Go dropped by the Bulgar Medical Mission and personally provided separate assistance to beneficiaries there. He also then provided aid to other indigent residents in Caloocan on the same day.  ",0
The Manila Times,"AMID challenges of rising costs of basic commodities and services brought about by rising inflation, the 13th month pay of workers in the private sector remains a legal obligation of employers, according to the Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE). Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma, though, assured employers, particularly hard-up businesses and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that were just starting to recover, to dialogue with their employees so that they can meet halfway and come up with a winning solution to the problem. Laguesma also gave his assurance that the Labor department would not resort to extreme actions of closing companies that failed to pay their employees the mandatory 13th month pay because doing so would be at the disadvantage of the workers also. ""We will not close down companies that cannot afford to pay their workers their 13th month pay. We don't like to deprive the workers of their opportunities to get their rightful benefits and continue with their jobs,"" he said. The Labor department, Laguesma added, is in consultation with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Small Business Corp. about the 13th month pay loan facility they earlier initiated to help the MSMEs meet their 13th month pay obligation to their workers at zero interest and without collateral. ""We wanted to know if said loan facility is still open. We wanted to know the terms of payment,"" he added. The DoLE secretary said they fully sympathize with the situation of employers at present but, he pointed out, employers could not avoid paying their employees the 13th month pay. ""The problem is this is a statutory legal obligation. It cannot be waived, and it cannot be a subject of an exemption,"" Laguesma also said. At the same time, he warned companies that have no valid reasons for not paying their workers' 13th month pay on time, saying they might turn out paying their employees double the amount of what they should originally pay. Under the Thirteenth Month Pay Law or Presidential Decree (PD) 851, rank-and-file employees in the private sector shall be entitled to 13th month pay regardless of their position, designation or employment status, and regardless of the method by which their wages are paid, provided that they have worked for at least one month during the calendar year. The formula and computation of the 13th month pay is: Total basic salary earned during the year divided by 12 months equals the proportionate 13th month pay. It shall be paid not later than December 24 of every year. An employer, however, may give to his or her employees one-half of the 13th month pay before the opening of the regular school year and the remaining half on or before December 24 of every year. The frequency of payment of this monetary benefit may be the subject of an agreement between the employer and the recognized collective bargaining agent of the employees. Exempted from payment of 13th month pay are the government and any of its political subdivisions, including government-owned and -controlled corporations, except those corporations operating essentially as private subsidiaries of the government; employers who are already paying their employees' 13th month pay or more in a calendar year or its equivalent at the time of the issuance of PD 851; persons in the personal service of another in relation to such workers; employers of those who are paid on purely commission, boundary or task basis, and those who are paid a fixed amount for performing specific work, regardless of the time consumed in the performance thereof (except those workers who are paid on piece-rate basis, in which case their employer shall grant them 13th month pay). An employee who has resigned or whose services are terminated at any time before the time of payment of the 13th month pay is entitled to this benefit in proportion to the length of time he or she has worked during the year, reckoned from the time he or she started working during the calendar year up to the time of his or her resignation or termination from the service. Sen. Mark Villar has filed a bill seeking to grant 13th month pay for contractual and job order personnel in the government service. In filing Senate Bill (SB) 1528 to be known as the ""13th Month Pay Law,"" Villar explained that contractual workers (COs) and job order (JO) personnel play a vital role in government service. ""They fulfill their duties diligently and passionately comparable to permanent government employees. Notwithstanding, they are not entitled to mid-year and year-end bonuses, such as the 13th-month pay, among other benefits,"" he said. Villar noted that job order and contractual workers do not receive benefits such as mid-year and year-end-bonus that regular or permanent employees of the government get. During his stint as Department of Public Works and Highways secretary, the senator said he saw the needs of government employees and his appreciation of the situation prompted him to file SB 1528. ""In light of the persistent rise in the inflation rate, which led to an extraordinary increase in prices of food, fuel and other commodities, Filipino workers, including contractual and job order personnel of the government, face greater hardships in their lives. Contractual and job order personnel lack security of tenure,"" according to the senator. Villar said based on his bill, the 13th month pay of job orders and contractual workers should not be less than one half of their monthly pay. ""The passage of the bill should be done post-haste. This will repay the services done by job orders to the government. The government knows how to repay the dedication and sacrifices of these workers this year,"" he explained. ""This bill supports the recent Joint Circular 2 of DBM (Department of Budget and Management) and CoA (Commission on Audit) extending the services of JOs and COs until December 2024,"" Villar pointed out. He said he expects some 642,000 non-permanent government workers to benefit from the passage of the measure by Congress.  ",0
The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. will sign an executive order (EO) to promote ease of doing business in the country as his administration targets to make the Philippines a ""top investment destination."" This, after the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Tuesday presented to Marcos the proposed EO on the Creation of Green Lane for Strategic Investments after identifying the barrier across multiple regulatory agencies that hamper the smooth entry of foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the country. ""Malaking bagay 'yun. That will address immediately 'yung tinatawag na ease of doing business na laging nirereklamo sa atin (That's a huge thing. That will immediately address the complaints we receive regarding ease of doing business),"" Marcos told DTI officials during their meeting in Malacañang. ""Until we get to change the procedures... and to say that... baka ito hindi na kailangan, baka ito extraneous na ito, ito obsolete na ito, ganyan (maybe, it's no longer needed, maybe it's extraneous, it's obsolete, like that). You cut it down as much as we can,"" he added. Cheloy Garafil, officer in charge, Office of the Press Secretary, said the EO will mandate concerned offices to establish a Green Lane to expedite and streamline the process and requirements for the issuance of permits and licenses, including resolutions of issues concerning strategic investments. The proposed EO, she said, will cover all national government agencies (NGAs) and their regional and provincial offices, local government units (LGUs) and quasi-judicial bodies involved in issuing permits and licenses necessary for establishing strategic investments in the country. ""The EO mandates NGAs and LGUs to act on a permit or license application not longer than three working days in the case of a simple transaction, seven working days in the case of complex transactions, and 20 working days for highly technical transactions from the date of receipt,"" she added. Garafil said among the strategic investments identified by the DTI were ""projects of national significance, highly desirable projects endorsed by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) and FDIs endorsed by the Inter-Agency Investments Promotion Coordination Committee (IAIPCC) or priority projects or activities under the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP), which are considered as projects of national significance or highly desirable that may be endorsed by the Board of Investments (BoI) of the concerned Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs)."" She said a technical working group headed by the DTI's BoI will implement the EO and a BoI-Investment Assistance Service (BoI-IAS) will become the single point of entry of investment availing of the Green Lane services endorsed as nationally significant or highly desirable projects. ""Non-compliance with the EO's provisions will be a ground for administrative and disciplinary sanctions against any erring public officer or employee, as provided under existing laws and regulations,"" Garafil added. Marcos has repeatedly promised that his administration will work to improve the ease of doing business in the country to help attract more investors. Speaking before the business community in October, the President said his administration targets to make the Philippines a ""top investment destination."" ""We continue to harmonize efforts of all investment promotion agencies, government agencies and local government units to effect greater synergies. We also continue to help in the ease of doing business in the country,"" Marcos said in his speech at the 48th Philippine Business Conference and Expo in Manila. ""We are doing this by enhancing our digital infrastructure in order to streamline application processes, business permits, licenses and other documentary requirements,"" he added. The President has also reiterated his government's commitment ""to make the Philippines a viable option for businesses, both for local and foreign investors."" ""That is why we feel that not only do we encourage foreign direct investment, not only do we encourage capital-intensive investments in our country, but we also very much must understand that the key, the driving force to begin all of this will be the local investors, the local businesses, and the local private sector companies that come into partnership with government to find the synergy that we all need for this new economy that we are facing,"" he said. Defense agenda Meanwhile, the President discussed with officials of the Department of Defense (DND) the 10-point defense agenda and the continued modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines during the meeting. ""The DND, on the other hand, discussed with the Commander in Chief the 10-point defense agenda aimed at improving the agency's capability to respond to various aspects of national security,"" the Palace said. Marcos had promised his continued support for the military's modernization amid geopolitical tensions and challenges posed by terrorism and natural disasters. ""While we strive to live in peace with others, it is still crucial that our Armed Forces be modernized so that it is ready for all eventualities,"" the President said during the turnover of a new aircraft and ground-based air defense system to the Philippine Air Force last month. ""It is for this reason that we strengthen our country's capabilities in territorial defense, counterterrorism and internal security,"" he added. Marcos said a modernized military would help ensure peace in the country, citing that when a nation enjoys peace, there is stability and progress. He said that peace could only be achieved ""when there is security"" and ""when you know that you can protect yourself, your possessions and those you hold dear."" Marcos has been promising to give troops newer equipment whenever he is invited to grace their anniversary celebrations. In October, the President assured the Philippine Coast Guard that his administration would back ""efforts and initiatives to modernize"" the maritime agency to ensure the ""better delivery of service to the nation."" Marcos also told the Philippine Air Force last July that the government would provide them with ""more state-of-the-art fighter planes and armed with more firepower.""  ",0
The Manila Times,"MIGRANT Workers Secretary Maria Susana ""Toots"" Ople and Commission on Audit (CoA) Chairman Gamaliel Cordoba got the approval of the Commission on Appointments (CA) to head their respective agencies. Ople and Cordoba on Tuesday faced the CA, which deliberated on their ad interim appointments as head of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and CoA, respectively. However, the CA suspended the deliberation of the ad interim appointment of Raphael Lotilla as Department of Energy (DoE) secretary for lack of time. Over 10 lawmakers were scheduled to ask questions to Lotilla, but only three were able to deliberate on his appointment. The panel also has to tackle the opposition to Lotilla's appointment filed by former DoE undersecretary Petronilo Ilagan, now president of the National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms. Ople, daughter of the late Senate president Blas Ople who was Labor secretary in the 1970s and early 1980s, has been hailed by concerned sectors as the woman ""tailor-fitted for the job."" ""When my father — the late and former Senate president Ka Blas Ople — died on Dec. 14, 2013, I pledged to dedicate my life to helping our migrant workers,"" the DMW chief said. ""It was and continues to be my way of honoring him, of keeping him close to me, and remembering the legacy he worked hard for,"" she said. Meanwhile, Sen. Francis Tolentino appealed to concerned sectors not to weaponize the CoA report against elected public officials. The senator deplored that CoA reports were being used against elected government officials. ""CoA reports should really be seen as a tool for good governance and not just a means or a weapon for harassment,"" Tolentino said. ""It can be done, it should be done... that positive CoA audit report should be coming out from your office as a tool for development, not just a tool for harassment and proliferation of negativity, especially among local chief executives,"" he said. Tolentino, being a former local chief executive, said he sympathized with many local officials who have been ""harassed, besmirched and victimized"" using the CoA reports. Senate President Pro Tempore Lorna Regina ""Loren"" Legarda, chairman of the Commission on Appointments' Committee on Energy, granted Sen. Joseph Victor ""JV"" Ejercito's motion to suspend the deliberation of Lotilla's designation since there were CA members who still have questions to ask the nominee. Lotilla was the second appointee of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. whose appointment was suspended by the body. The first was Erwin Tulfo as secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development who was questioned on his citizenship and his convictions on four counts of libel. Legarda said the mandate of the DoE secretary is to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects, and activities of the state relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation. She said the DoE ""requires a leader who can champion sustainable energy policies while steering the energy industry towards becoming energy resilient and independent in the face of both energy crisis, a climate crisis and a spate of oil price hikes.""

The Manila Times,"THE House of Representatives has approved, on second reading a bill that seeks to create the Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines. Batanes Rep. Ciriaco Gato Jr., chairman of the Committee on Health, sponsored the bill when it was taken up for consideration during plenary session on Tuesday. A bill for the creation of a virology institute is part of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council's Common Legislative Agenda. ""Given the urgency of the [...] bill, this humble representation, as Chairperson of the Committee on Health, together with the Committee on Science and Technology, entreats the support of this august body to immediately approve the [..] bill, with the end view of attaining health security for the Filipino nation, which is essential in sustaining national growth and development"", Gato said in his sponsorship speech. Through voice vote, the bill hurdled second reading. If the bill is passed into law, the institute would be created as an attached agency of the Department of Science and Technology. Based on Gato's sponsorship speech, the bill seeks to create an institute that will do ""in-depth studies on viruses"". Earlier this month, the House Committees on Health and Science and Technology approved the bill. A similar proposal to create such an institute is pending at the Senate.  ",0
The Manila Times,"Sen. Maria Imelda Josefa ""Imee"" Marcos has committed to working with the agriculture department on the establishment of food terminals in the National Capital Region and other neighboring regions that will serve as areas where locally produced vegetables could be sold. In her message during the celebration of the 122nd founding anniversary of the Benguet and Adivay festival which was read by board member Marie Rose Fongwan-Kepes, the senator pointed out that the resumption of operation of the food terminals will help in providing additional venues where quality and cheap vegetables from Benguet and the Cordillera will be sold at affordable prices. The senator noted that she will convince her brother, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who is also serving as the Agriculture Secretary, to ensure the operation of the said food terminals in strategic areas around Metro Manila to expand the areas where highland vegetables will be made available to the people. In April, Senator Marcos, through the enhanced Kadiwa program, donated several trucks to various local governments mostly in Benguet to transport for free the vegetables from the province to the different markets so that similar products will be sold at affordable prices and to ensure a sustainable supply of highland vegetables. Moreover, she also allocated funds from the government's Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation to extend assistance to the victims of calamities that struck the province over the past several months. She encouraged the people and LGU officers of the province to sustain the efforts to preserve the rich culture, history, and heritage of Benguet so that the same may be passed on to future generations of inhabitants. Senator Marcos assured the Benguet people that she will continue to lobby with the Agriculture department for the allocation of more funds to help improve the current state of vegetable production in the province and fight the unabated smuggling of imported crops from China. ""Adivay"" or coming together is what people need at this time to contribute to the ongoing efforts of both the government and the private sector to recover from the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on agriculture — a major source of livelihood in the different parts of the province. She rallied the Igorots and Ilocanos to strengthen the camaraderie to be able to advance the appropriate programs, projects, activities, and advocacies that will contribute to enhancing the state of the province's agriculture sector so that it will be able to propel the local economy and bring back its vibrance to pre-pandemic levels for the benefit of the greater majority of the populace. Benguet remains to be the source of over 80 percent of the supply of semi-temperate vegetables being sold in the different markets around the country over the past several decades. For his part, Rep. Eric Yap disclosed that the congressional inquiry into the smuggling of vegetables is expected to start anytime after the concerned House committee has disposed of the ongoing investigation on the problem of tobacco farmers and the tobacco industry. He asserted that smugglers should be penalized with life imprisonment to prevent them from repeating the same offense that impacts the country's agriculture sector. Yap claimed that many smugglers had been arrested but they are still able to pursue their illegal activities, thus, the need for the government, through appropriate laws, to impose stiffer penalties against them to send a clear message that the efforts to curb the proliferation of smuggling are for real.

The Manila Times,"BUSINESSES are generally satisfied with the Marcos administration's performance, the chief of the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) claimed on Monday. ""[I]n general, the Marcos administration has been listening, and we are happy about the outcome,"" MAP President Rogelio Singson told reporters during a general membership meeting where the business group also recognized Isidro Consunji as Management Man of the Year. Consunji, chairman and president of DMCI Holdings Inc., agreed, saying: ""Economy-wise, overall, I think the administration's economic team has done a stellar job in managing the economy. ""Despite the headwinds, the people are currently happy,"" he added. Singson, whose term ends on December 31, said progress had been made with regard to most of the MAP's recommendations. The business group in July released a wish list covering education, health care, agriculture and agribusiness, trade and industrial policy, infrastructure adequacy, labor market and employment policies, fiscal and financial policies, and justice and rule of law. Among others, it called for the return of face-to-face classes; the ratification of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement; enhancement of the country's attractiveness to foreign investments; the continuation of the ""Build, Build, Build"" program, policies in support of micro, small and medium enterprises; and government transparency and zero tolerance for corruption.

The Manila Times,"AT least 60 more remains of persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) left unclaimed at the accredited funeral parlor of the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) will be buried this week, the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) said. ""Next Friday, 60 more PDLs will be buried. There are about 40 cadavers left that are planned for autopsy,"" BuCor Officer in Charge Gregorio Catapang said in a radio interview on Monday. The 41 cadavers at the Eastern Funeral Homes in Muntinlupa City will possibly be transferred to the University of the Philippines College of Medicine where they will be autopsied. Earlier this month, 10 bodies were buried at the NBP cemetery while 60 unclaimed cadavers were buried last Friday. The cadavers were among the 176 bodies found at the Eastern Funeral Homes, the lone accredited funeral parlor of the NBP, last October during the investigation of the death of Cristito Villamor Palaña, an inmate who was identified as one of the middlemen in the killing of broadcaster Percival ""Percy Lapid"" Mabasa. Catapang said the NBP has reached out to the families of the dead inmates. He said the cadavers that will be buried are in an advanced state of decomposition. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla earlier ordered the autopsy of the remains to determine the cause of death and if there was foul play. Remulla said forensic pathologist Dr. Raquel Fortun has autopsied at least five cadavers.  ",0
The Manila Times,"MIGRANT Workers Secretary Maria Susana ""Toots"" Ople and Commission on Audit (CoA) Chairman Gamaliel Cordoba got the approval of the Commission on Appointments (CA) to head their respective agencies. Ople and Cordoba on Tuesday faced the CA, which deliberated on their ad interim appointments as head of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and CoA, respectively. However, the CA suspended the deliberation of the ad interim appointment of Raphael Lotilla as Department of Energy (DoE) secretary for lack of time. Over 10 lawmakers were scheduled to ask questions to Lotilla, but only three were able to deliberate on his appointment. The panel also has to tackle the opposition to Lotilla's appointment filed by former DoE undersecretary Petronilo Ilagan, now president of the National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms. Ople, daughter of the late Senate president Blas Ople who was Labor secretary in the 1970s and early 1980s, has been hailed by concerned sectors as the woman ""tailor-fitted for the job."" ""When my father — the late and former Senate president Ka Blas Ople — died on Dec. 14, 2013, I pledged to dedicate my life to helping our migrant workers,"" the DMW chief said. ""It was and continues to be my way of honoring him, of keeping him close to me, and remembering the legacy he worked hard for,"" she said. Meanwhile, Sen. Francis Tolentino appealed to concerned sectors not to weaponize the CoA report against elected public officials. The senator deplored that CoA reports were being used against elected government officials. ""CoA reports should really be seen as a tool for good governance and not just a means or a weapon for harassment,"" Tolentino said. ""It can be done, it should be done... that positive CoA audit report should be coming out from your office as a tool for development, not just a tool for harassment and proliferation of negativity, especially among local chief executives,"" he said. Tolentino, being a former local chief executive, said he sympathized with many local officials who have been ""harassed, besmirched and victimized"" using the CoA reports. Senate President Pro Tempore Lorna Regina ""Loren"" Legarda, chairman of the Commission on Appointments' Committee on Energy, granted Sen. Joseph Victor ""JV"" Ejercito's motion to suspend the deliberation of Lotilla's designation since there were CA members who still have questions to ask the nominee. Lotilla was the second appointee of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. whose appointment was suspended by the body. The first was Erwin Tulfo as secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development who was questioned on his citizenship and his convictions on four counts of libel. Legarda said the mandate of the DoE secretary is to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects, and activities of the state relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation. She said the DoE ""requires a leader who can champion sustainable energy policies while steering the energy industry towards becoming energy resilient and independent in the face of both energy crisis, a climate crisis and a spate of oil price hikes.""

Escudero brought up franchise issues surrounding two energy cooperatives in Iloilo where Congress, in the past, chose to grant only one franchise.  ",0
The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Tuesday expressed elation over a recent survey that showed a majority of Filipinos believe that better days are ahead for the Philippines. The Chief Executive tagged as ""very encouraging"" the ""Tugon ng Masa"" poll conducted by OCTA Research, which showed that the majority of adult Filipinos see the country heading ""in the right direction."" ""It is very encouraging that people think we are moving in the right direction... I saw that it crosses demographics, the number is more or less the same across the demographics. So, that is important to me. Every class of society must feel that they are being served by the government,"" he said, following his visit to the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, Laguna. The survey conducted from Oct. 23 to 27, 2022 showed that 85 percent of the 1,200 respondents believe that the government's interventions are steadily bringing the country out from the slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, 9 percent remains doubtful and 6 percent are still undecided. The same poll showed that those in the Visayas registered the highest agreement that the country is moving in the right direction, with 91 percent, while 87 percent in Balance Luzon, or Luzon outside Metro Manila; 84 percent in Mindanao; and 70 percent of adult Filipinos in Metro Manila think the country is moving in the right direction. Among classes A to E, 79 to 86 percent agree the Philippines is on the right path under the President's leadership. ""With that kind of statistic, it looks like we have at least, we have made the government felt at every level of society. That's what's important,"" noted Marcos. Malacañang, in a previous statement, said the survey is also proof that the public is aware that the President ""is determined and committed to making the lives of all Filipinos better, with programs providing job opportunities and ease in doing business and ensuring food security."" The Palace likewise reiterated that the leader and his administration will continue to work ""to fulfill his campaign promises to every Filipino here and abroad.""  ",0
The Manila Times,"MEMBERS of Congress, and I'm referring to both houses, are expected to craft laws which would best best serve the interest of the people. Unfortunately, however, a group of lawmakers who were responsible for the enactment of Republic Act 11659 not only betrayed the very people they have vowed to serve, but have even exposed all of us to security threats. Last week, at a media forum, two prominent lawyers, Larry Gadon and Ferdie Topacio, assailed RA 11659, also known as the ""Public Service Act,"" saying it was not only unconstitutional but also poses a threat to the country's economy and security. According to the two lawyers, the lawmakers effectively amended the Constitution when they redefined public utility as public services so that the former term would now only refer to electricity distribution and transmission, petroleum and petroleum products, pipeline transmission systems, water and wastewater pipeline distribution and sewerage systems, seaports and public utility vehicles. With the Public Service Act, airports, railroads, railways, subways, wire or wireless telecommunication services, and wire or wireless broadcasting stations are no longer considered as public utilities, thereby opening them up to 100 percent foreign ownership. The new law, Gadon and Topacio claimed, overturned what has been protected for almost a hundred years by all the Constitutions adopted by the Filipinos to govern the country, as the 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions have declared that public utilities which include airports, railroads, railways, subways, wire or wireless telecommunication services, and wire or wireless broadcasting stations, should have at least 60 percent Filipino ownership and foreign ownership to be limited to 40 percent. In order to run around the constitutional provision, the two lawyers said, the lawmakers redefined the coverage of public utility by removing from it airports, railroads, railways, subways, broadcast stations and wireless telecommunication, but retained seaports, electricity distribution, transmission of petroleum and petroleum products, water distribution and sewerage systems, and public utility vehicles. By doing this, they have arrogated to themselves the power solely vested on the Supreme Court — the interpretation of the law. Under this new Public Service Act, the United States no longer needs to invoke EDCA, or the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, to put up military bases. They would simply put up their own airports over which they have absolute control and who knows what they would be putting out there. We have just become targets of whichever opponents the US might pick. But again no. Maybe other countries could also put up their own military bases here in the disguise of commercial airports. And presto! We have just become their mini battlegrounds. Why bring the war to their respective territories when they can do their battles here, thousands of miles away from their countries. Actually, even when the bills were still being deliberated at the Senate and the House of Representatives before being signed into law by former president Rodrigo Duterte last March, lawyer Ariel Inton, president of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, had already expressed his opposition to the then proposed law. According to Inton, proponents of the measure came up with a brilliant strategy of amending the Constitution without resorting to legal processes. The proponents insist that we have to lift the nationality requirements for the industries which used to be listed as public utilities to attract foreign investors. However, Inton said, a study revealed that it is not the nationality requirement which turns off these foreign investors, but the corruption, inadequate structures and bureaucratic red tape which are allegedly synonymous with setting up business here in the Philippines. These, according to Inton, are what should be addressed by the government. Proof of this, according to the LCSP president, is the fact that even months after RA 11659, there are still no foreign takers. But even with or without any foreign taker, the threat to the national economy and security remains. And that is aside from the fact it is in direct violation of the Constitution. To remedy the situation, RJ Javellana, president of the United Filipino Consumers and Commuters, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the Supreme Court seeking to declare RA 11659 unconstitutional. Respondents to the petition are Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. In his petition, Javellana said ""the country cannot afford to leave these public services in the hands of foreigners whose interest or agenda may be detrimental to national interests."" Of course. But if I may add, we also cannot leave the fate of the country to lawmakers such as those who crafted the bills leading to RA 11659 who view foreign interest as far superior to that of the people whom they have sworn to serve. It's been almost half-a-month since former media man Benny Antiporda was suspended as acting administrator of the National Irrigation Administration by the Office of the Ombudsman over some petty complaints filed by some disgruntled employees of the agency, but up to now, we haven't heard of any action from the Ombudsman with regard to the graft cases filed by Antiporda against some NIA officials. Except maybe to ask for their counter-affidavits in relation to the case. A legal procedure denied by the Ombudsman to Antiporda when they handed him his suspension order. To recall, a group of concerned NIA employees filed a case against Antiporda last November 3 and 12 days after, on November 15, the Ombudsman's office, without furnishing Antiporda a copy of the complaint and asking him to answer the said complaints, issued a six-month preventive suspension against the acting NIA administrator, signed by no less than Ombudsman Samuel Martirez. Acting on an anonymous complaint with haste, even suspending the respondent without according him any chance to refute or answer the allegations against him? And I had always thought Martirez to be a brilliant legal mind. He was even appointed as associate justice of the Supreme Court before being appointed ombudsman. Was he aware he was denying Antiporda his basic right when he signed his suspension order without asking him to present anything to answer his accusers who, at that time, were nameless and faceless? Take note that officers and members of the NIA Employees Association of the Philippines have categorically denied any hand in the filing of the complaint against Antiporda, and on the contrary, even expressed support for him. Isn't Martirez courting impeachment? According to some lawyers I have talked to, the ombudsman could be liable for betrayal of public trust for the manner in which he handled Antiporda's case. But then, they may be wrong as they might not be as brilliant as Martirez.   ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Public Attorney's Office (PAO) on Monday urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) leadership to issue an order against killing a person who was already kneeling and pleading for mercy. Interviewed by The Manila Times, PAO chief Persida Rueda-Acosta lamented that such unfortunate incidents continue to occur although she opted not to expound, saying there were relatives who were afraid to come out for fear of their lives. She pointed at the case of teenagers Carl Angelo Arnaiz and Reynaldo ""Kulot"" de Guzman whose arresting lawmen — POI Jeffrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquilita — were both found guilty by a Caloocan trial court judge for planting evidence and torturing them before they died. ""This is the first case of torture that the PAO has won, of course, with the team-up of our public attorneys and prosecutors,"" the chief public attorney said. She then pressed the PNP officials to do something to help erase the bad image of police brutality. ""The PNP must have a marching order that if a person they are arresting was already kneeling that showed surrendering, he must be spared and not shot and killed. They must have mercy,"" Rueda-Acosta said. It would be a different story if the person being arrested is resisting and threatening the lives of the arresting lawmen. ""If that's the situation, it's normal that the lawmen must fight back, unlike the case of Arnaiz who was already kneeling to show that he was surrendering, but he was still shot and killed. There was an eyewitness whose testimony convinced the judge to find them guilty,"" the PAO chief said. The Manila Times tried to reach the family of the two teenagers to ask for their comment about the ruling handed out last week by Caloocan City Regional Trial Court Branch 122 Judge Rodrigo Pascua Jr., but they preferred not to issue a statement. ""But, of course, they were very happy that their children had finally found justice, and they were thankful, too, to our public lawyers as well as prosecutors and more importantly, to the lone eyewitness, Arnold Perlada,"" she said. The RTC judge sentenced Perez to two life terms plus reclusion perpetua (another 20 to 40 years) for the duo's killing, which took place at the peak of the anti-drug war of former president Rodrigo Duterte in 2017. In handing the verdict, Pascua gave more weight to the testimony of Perlada along with the findings of Dr. Erwin Erfe, PAO Forensics Division chief, in convicting Perez of violating the Anti-Torture Act of 2010 and violation of the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 for the planting of evidence. Perez and Arquilita claimed that Arnaiz was killed in a shooting incident during a legitimate anti-illegal drug operation. Arquilita died during the pendency of the trial of the case. Perlada said that on Aug. 17, 2017, he and a friend came from a party on Taksay Street in Caloocan when he witnessed the killing of Arnaiz. He told the court that he saw the policemen bringing Arnaiz out of a parked police car and ordered him to kneel on a grassy area. While holding up his bound wrists and shouting that he was surrendering, Arnaiz was still shot, three times, Perlada said. He likewise testified that he saw another young boy inside the police car that night, who is believed to be de Guzman, a friend of Arnaiz. Arnaiz and de Guzman went missing from their residence in Cainta, Rizal, and their bodies were found on Sept. 5, 2017, in a creek in Gapan, Nueva Ecija. The court was convinced by the forensic examination conducted by Erfe on Arnaiz's body that showed he was kneeling when he was shot several times in the chest. With Arnaiz's swollen wrists, handcuff marks and bruised eyes, there was no doubt that he was tortured before he was killed, the court said.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Philippine National Police (PNP) on Monday said the anti-drug campaign of the Marcos administration saw a decline in the number of drug laboratories being dismantled in the country. PNP Officer in Charge and Deputy Chief for Administration LtGen. Rhodel Sermonia told reporters in a media briefing that the anti-drug campaign has been effective as there are fewer drug laboratories. ""Unlike before, we do not see so many drug laboratories anymore. We used to seize tons of chemicals used in drug manufacturing. Now we only dismantle small ones. This is a manifestation that they are getting weaker. Some are just small-time, and we cannot even call them laboratories,"" Sermonia said. ""It only goes to show that the current administration is doing well,"" he added. Sermonia made the remarks at the sidelines of the launch of the new anti-drug campaign ""Buhay Ingatan, Droga'y Ayawan"" (BIDA) at the PNP headquarters at Camp Crame. He admitted, though, that there are casualties that cannot be avoided in their anti-drug campaign, even as the government continues to uphold the protection of human rights. Sermonia said that police have the right to defend themselves when in danger. The official added the BIDA program includes providing livelihood opportunities for drug surrenderers. ""The BIDA strategy, being a whole-of-nation approach, also includes skills and development program. When we say skills and development program or training, they have to learn something to make a living or to work on, of course through the help of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority,"" he said. ""The Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Labor and Employment will also come in so we will know what industries can give them jobs,"" he added. The BIDA program is a nationwide anti-illegal drugs advocacy involving local government units, national government agencies, and other key sectors of society that will focus more on drug demand reduction and rehabilitation in the communities coupled with arrests. Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. said the program aims to reduce drug demand and rehabilitate drug dependents. The BIDA program will work with the villages, the church and religious communities and the general public in addressing the country's illegal drug woes and rehabilitating illegal drug victims. The Department of the Interior and Local Government said that over 24,000 illicit drug personalities have been nabbed. ""The raids on drug dens and the police and other authorities' pursuit of drug lords, financiers and drug peddlers will not stop. It's still going on,"" Abalos said. ""The police should not be the only ones to act. Citizens are our partners in the anti-drug campaign. We must all take action and become BIDA advocates."" He said P9.9 billion worth of illegal drugs have been confiscated in drug operations.  ",0

The Manila Times,"ENERGY Secretary Raphael Lotilla on Monday criticized a Court of Appeals (CA) restraining order halting regulatory disapproval of San Miguel Global Power Corp.'s rate hike petition, saying all parties concerned had not been given enough time to prepare. Lotilla's statement followed President Ferdinand Marcos' calling the CA decision ""unfortunate"" and higher power prices on Sunday. Malacañang said the president was hoping that the court would reconsider. Last September 29, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) denied a join petition by the San Miguel Corp. power unit and Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) for a rate increase, ruling that the supply deal between the two firms provided no room for adjustments. San Miguel Global Power asked the CA to reverse the ruling earlier this month and the appellate court last week responded by issuing a temporary restraining order (TRO). Lotilla said the TRO, ""which took effect immediately does not provide the distribution utilities and all other parties concerned with adequate time for preparation"". ""The Solicitor General has been in communication with the ERC on the steps to be taken to lift the TRO,"" he added. ""The Department of Energy is also coordinating with Meralco, the independent market operator, and all concerned, particularly on the contingency measures."" San Miguel Global Power, meanwhile, continued to criticize the ERC on Monday, saying the decision ""which forces us to continue absorbing billions in losses in the face of a continuing war in Ukraine and escalating global fuel prices, is against its mandate."" Filipino enterprises, it added, are entitled to a ""fair hearing by an independent, impartial tribunal."" ""Going to the Court of Appeals is part of our right to due process among the legal remedies provided to us by the Constitution. We recognize and respect the independence of the judiciary as part of our system of check and balance,"" the firm continued. It claimed that projections in the rate hike potion had been reviewed by the ERC's Regulatory Operations Service, ""yet, the ERC chair and two commissioners denied the petition, forcing us to continue to absorb losses, and essentially preventing us from exercising our legal options, clearly laid out in the PSAs (power supply agreements), to preserve our financial standing."" ""This, despite, two other commissioners delivering strong dissenting opinions,"" it added.  ",0
The Manila Times,"A WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT approach is key in realizing the policies and strategies of the upcoming Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 geared toward job creation and speeding up poverty reduction in the country, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said on Monday. In a forum with government information and communication officers in preparation for the PDP's completion next month, NEDA Secretary Arsenio Balisacan underscored that collaboration among communication teams of offices within the government is an integral part of the whole-of-government approach for development planning. ""As government information officers, you perceive the pulse of the Filipino people. Through various media and channels, you are the heralds who are crucial in ensuring that the link between the public and the government remains strong, truthful and unbroken. As the launch of the PDP 2023-2028 approaches, we seek your thoughts and efforts to guarantee not only its effective implementation but also its successful communication to the public — our fellow Filipinos, for whom the plan is formulated,"" Balisacan said. NEDA highlighted that the government must always ensure the communication of accurate and timely information to the public, especially on socioeconomic policies that have significant implications. Alongside public consultations, the agency noted that effective communication can enable useful feedback from stakeholders such that programs and policies are adjusted to become more impactful. The forum is a continuation of NEDA's PDP forums held last September, which convened stakeholders from the youth, private and government planning sectors, respectively. The latest forum's goal is to collect insights from the communication teams of various government agencies and units, which will be useful for the upcoming release of the new PDP. NEDA is now nearing the completion of the PDP 2023-2028 and is looking to present the plan to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his Cabinet early next month. It earlier said that social protection and human capital development will be among top priorities in the short to medium term under the upcoming plan. The PDP 2023-2028 shall provide a roadmap toward unlocking sustained and inclusive growth for the Philippine economy despite the challenges brought by health, geopolitical and other economic shocks.

The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Sunday expressed hope the Court of Appeals (CA) will reconsider its issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) suspending the implementation of the South Premier Power Corp. (SPPC) Power Supply Agreement (PSA) with the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). Marcos echoed the concern of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) that the TRO will further burden Meralco consumers already saddled with high electricity costs. ""On the implementation of the PSA between Meralco and San Miguel, it is unfortunate that this has happened. It will cause further dislocations and possible price increase for power,"" the Chief Executive said in a statement, noting the TRO is against the PSA. ""We hope that the CA will reconsider this and include in their deliberations the extremely deleterious effect this will have on power prices for ordinary Filipinos,"" he added. The appellate court's 14th Division recently handed down the TRO favoring SPPC, a subsidiary of San Miguel Corp. The TRO will be in effect within 60 days from service to the respondents. The SPPC filed a petition hoping that the CA will grant the rate petition ""without prejudice to any further requests for price adjustments for June 2022 onwards."" Earlier, its plea for price increase was denied by the ERC since the regulatory body ruled that the agreed price in the PSA is already fixed in nature. Moreover, the grounds for increase cited by SPPC and Meralco were not among the exceptions that would allow for a price adjustment. The ERC also aired concern on the instantaneous effect of the temporary suspension on the implementation of the PSA. It said this will consequently expose 7.5 million Meralco consumers in the National Capital Region and other areas in Central Luzon and Calabarzon to higher electricity prices without the preparation usually observed in the case of PSA termination. It further pointed out that the fixed price PSA of Meralco with SPPC covers 670 MW of supply which, along with the other fixed price PSAs, has shielded Meralco consumers for the past several months from the volatility of prices from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) and automatic fuel pass-through PSAs. If the PSAs are immediately suspended, the required proper observance of the terms of the PSA, including the contractually-agreed process of termination, will be set aside, the ERC said.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) will not be abolished if the country establishes a Center for Disease Control (CDC), Albay Second District Rep. Jose Ma. Clemente ""Joey"" Salceda said. In a statement on Sunday, Salceda was quoted as saying, ""Let me categorically state, on record, that the RITM will stay. It will continue to perform most of its functions, and there will be no layoffs."" Earlier this month, the House Committee on Health approved the substitute bill that seeks to create the said center. The pertinent provisions of the proposed center's charter have been approved by the House Committee on Appropriations and the House Committee on Ways and Means. Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, said that ""the CDC will be primarily a national health emergency management, public policy and research center."" ""The RITM is, and will continue to be, its own research center with a hospital, a testing center and the country's central reference laboratory. It will also continue to perform its existing role over many diseases, including perennial ones like tuberculosis and malaria,"" he said. In a media forum conducted by the Department of Health on Friday, DoH Officer in Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the RITM will not be abolished if the proposed center is created. She also said that all RITM workers will be absorbed. Earlier, some RITM employees protested against what was perceived to be an abolition of the institute if the CDC would be created.  ",0
The Manila Times,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go said more Super Health Centers (SHCs) will be established nationwide as he raised the importance of further strengthening the country's health care system. The senator said he will continue to push for the establishment of more SHCs as part of his commitment to make health services more accessible to Filipinos, especially in remote communities. The senator made the remark as he sent aid to struggling communities in Rosario, Cavite. Go, with fellow senator Robinhood Padilla, also inspected an SHC and helped residents in Matanao, Davao del Sur. In his video message during a relief operation in Rosario, Cavite on November 22, Go reaffirmed his efforts ""to bring the government's public health services closer to more disadvantaged Filipinos."" ""Thank you for your sacrifice during this time. Let us just help one another. Please do not neglect our poor fellowmen,"" the senator said in Filipino. The chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography said that 307 SHCs will be constructed in 2022 and more in 2023. Super Health Centers will offer basic health services such as database management, out-patient, birthing, isolation, diagnostic (laboratory: x-ray, ultrasound), pharmacy and ambulatory surgical unit. Other available services are eye, ear, nose, and throat treatment; oncology; physical therapy and rehabilitation; and telemedicine, where remote diagnosis and treatment of patients will be done. There will be eight SHCs in 2022 in Cavite. These centers will be located in the cities of Bacoor, Dasmariñas, General Trias, and Imus as well as in the towns of Carmona, Kawit, Magallanes and Tanza. Meanwhile, Go urged those with health concerns to seek the services of the Malasakit Centers located at Southern Tagalog Regional Hospital in Bacoor City and General Emilio Aguinaldo Memorial Hospital in Trece Martires City. He initiated the Malasakit Centers program in 2018. It aims to ensure that medical assistance programs are within the reach of indigent patients. To date, there are 153 Malasakit Centers nationwide.

The Manila Times,"THE government's decision to remove import barriers to electric vehicles, or EVs, is a step in the right direction, although policymakers should consider going further by extending similar privileges to hybrid cars.  In a press briefing last week, Secretary Arsenio Balisacan of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) announced that his office had endorsed an executive order to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. that would suspend for five years tariffs on completely built-up units, or CBUs, of electric vehicles. Plus, import duties on certain EV parts and components will be slashed from 5 percent to 1 percent over the same period. The order should become effective by December and will be reviewed after a year. Obviously, the government wants to encourage Filipinos to buy EVs, such as passenger cars, buses, vans, trucks, motorcycles, tricycles, scooters, bicycles and others like them. If that goal is met, the Philippines could reduce its dependence on imported oil, which accounts for the largest component of rising inflation these days. The problem is the lack of charging stations in the country, which may discourage consumers from purchasing EVs in the coming years. Shell Philippines only recently opened a charging station south of Metro Manila, and eight more are reportedly in the pipeline by yearend. Clearly, many more charging stations will be needed to encourage robust EV sales. Mr. Balisacan acknowledged this problem when asked about it by reporters. But he said it was a chicken-and-egg situation, meaning the government hopes that having more EVs on the road will accelerate the development of charging stations across the country. On a related issue, private firms will need to improve the charging technology. Based on reports, it takes about 30 minutes to fully charge an EV at Shell, at a cost of P65 per minute or a total of P1,950. The price seems reasonable, but motorists may lack the patience or time to wait half an hour for a full charge. Hybrids and CKDs Regrettably, NEDA's proposed executive order does not include hybrid vehicles. They are essentially self-charging cars that also have an internal combustion engine. A few models have been introduced in the Philippines, but if consumers want to buy one, they contend with a long waiting list and higher prices relative to regular vehicles. Giving tax breaks to hybrids could have a faster impact on lowering the country's dependence on oil and on inflation. Also, hybrid vehicles are not dependent on the development of charging stations. Policymakers should consider giving them tax breaks, perhaps until EV sales start taking off. Moreover, NEDA and others in government should consider limiting the tax incentives to completely knocked down, or CKD units. Importing CKDs will generate jobs, because unlike CBUs, they require local assembly before they are put up for sale. For good measure, the authorities should consider incentives for exporting EVs and hybrids that were assembled in the country. From the Philippines, auto assemblers can sell to other members of Asean, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. That bloc has a combined market of about 680,000. And once the Philippines ratifies the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement among the Asia-Pacific nations, the country will become part of the largest free-trade zone in the world, which will include the 10 Asean members, plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Importing CBUs could create a problem — a substitution threat — for local car assemblers that have invested heavily to construct facilities in the country and have hired local workers to operate them. NEDA is likely aware of this possible issue, which is perhaps why it plans a review after only a year. Lastly, the Philippines should hasten its development of emission-free energy plants, including nuclear power. Relying on fossil fuels to run power plants will mitigate the benefits of widespread use of EVs and hybrids. Surely, no one in the government wants higher electricity prices that may result from higher demand from EV owners. Despite all the concerns mentioned here, the executive order proposed by NEDA should result in a net gain for the Philippines. But as we also noted, there is always room for improvement.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Philippines is an archipelagic country with a good seafaring status, but it lacks a national maritime agenda, Brenda Pimentel, former regional coordinator of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in East Asia, said. She urged President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. to create a maritime agenda that will align industry objectives and support his administration's plan to develop infrastructure. ""If we have a national maritime agenda, all the agencies will have to align with these objectives. They will not just develop their own policy independent of others. Everything will then fall into place,"" Pimentel said in an interview on Saturday with SMNI News Channel's ""Business and Politics"" program host Dante ""Klink"" Ang 2nd, the chairman and CEO of The Manila Times. She added that former president Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. issued a national maritime policy through Presidential Decree (PD) 474 on June 1, 1974. It reorganized the maritime functions in the country by creating the Maritime Industry Authority (Marina). The Marina linked various islands through sea transport and enhanced the competitive position of Philippine flag vessels in foreign trade. ""The convenors of the Movement for Maritime Philippines are pushing for a national maritime agenda. I hope the President realizes that PD 474, issued by his father, already talked of a national maritime policy. I hope we can look back to that,"" Pimentel said. Former president Rodrigo Duterte promoted the country's maritime agenda through the issuance of Proclamation 316 declaring September as Maritime and Archipelagic Nation Awareness Month. The proclamation helped boost maritime awareness among the public and the government. When he was campaigning for president, Marcos Jr. talked of modernizing the country's port system and developing the Philippines as a shipping and logistics center by liberalizing foreign ownership of public utilities and bringing investments. ""There should be a paradigm shift. Planning should not be limited only to shipyards and ports. We can only do that if we have a national maritime agenda,"" she said. Pimentel said that a coherent maritime agenda can further protect the interests of poor maritime communities, such as the fishermen. ""Their livelihood is threatened by ballast water coming from international vessels that are calling in Philippine ports,"" she observed. Ballast water is made up of fresh or salt water pumped into a ship's ballast tanks to provide stability during the voyage. It is often taken from the coastal waters of one region and discharged at the next port of call. ""There is a possibility that our fish are eaten by the invasive species brought here by the ballast water of ships,"" she said.  ",0
The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has called on the media to help convey to the public his government's undertakings during the oath-taking ceremony of the newly elected officers of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) in Malacañang on Friday. The KBP promotes professional and ethical standards in Philippine broadcasting and the protection of press freedom. In a statement, Malacañang said Marcos acknowledged the media's contributions to democracy and promised its members that their rights would be upheld and protected. Calls for the protection of journalists in the Philippines were renewed following the murder of radio commentator Percival Mabasa (also known as Percy Lapid) — a staunch critic of both Marcos and his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos, in an earlier statement, ordered the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police to conduct a deeper probe into the assassination even though the gunman and the mastermind were already identified. ""We're trying to make sure that we know exactly what this is all about. The more we look, the worst it gets, this is too deadly right now,"" the President said. ""We'll just keep going. Until we're satisfied. Right now, because we haven't spoken to all of the named suspects, middlemen, masterminds, the investigation hasn't been closed,"" he added.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE recent conviction of police officers charged with planting evidence and torturing drug suspects supports the argument that the government does not condone impunity. Policemen Jeffrey Perez and Ricky Arquilita denied the charges and may even face murder raps in the future. But for now, a court found them guilty and sentenced Mr. Perez to a minimum of 20 years' imprisonment. Mr. Arquilita died before the trial concluded. Amnesty International downplayed the conviction as a ""drop in the bucket,"" given the thousands who died during war on drugs waged by then-president Rodrigo Duterte. That seems unfair. At least 6,200 did die during the campaign, according to official figures. But that number pales in comparison with the millions who voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and underwent treatment during the previous government's tenure. The recent conviction may be rare but may be more are coming. Human Rights Watch, citing the Department of Justice, reported that the government was investigating 52 cases involving 154 policemen implicated in questionable killings. That seems hard to reconcile with allegations that the state policy had been to condone or even encourage murdering suspected drug offenders. Granted, Mr. Duterte did threaten to kill drug pushers. But in his defense, his allies claim that outrageous soundbites were merely political theater. He simply wanted to get a message through an audience that was not going be moved by ""pretty please"" or similar polite appeals to stop using and peddling illegal drugs. Despite Mr. Duterte's controversial approach, the government followed the law as best it could. The Dangerous Drugs Board or DDB ""... reiterates that no policies have been issued that permit, tolerate and condone killings and other human rights violations in relation to the Philippine's anti-drug campaign."" Police rights Besides, law enforcers have the right to protect themselves. The Commission on Human Rights released a report earlier this year, saying 18 victims of the drug war were in law enforcement. That number included 11 active-duty members of the Philippine National Police. Indeed, those who died in the line of duty deserve the same public sympathy from human rights advocates and others who have been relentless in criticizing the past administration's drug war. Some refuse or deny to appreciate that when Mr. Duterte was elected president, some 90 percent of villages were infiltrated by drug syndicates. He may have failed to eradicate the drug problem, as he had promised, but before leaving office, only 36.6 percent of the villages were yet to be cleared of illegal drugs operations. The DDB reported that 1.67 percent of Filipinos between ages 10 and 69 still use illegal substances. And from the start of the Duterte administration to early this year, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency has seized P89.79 billion worth of narcotics. Drug abuse is far from the harmless or recreational habit that some may imagine. To paraphrase Mr. Duterte, illegal drugs ruin lives and even exacts an economic toll, particularly on lost labor productivity. That may be because among Filipino substance abusers, the leading drug used is ""shabu"" or methamphetamine hydrochloride. There should be more indignation and public outcry against those pushing illegal drugs. Also, there should be more attention given to the lives and families ruined by illegal substances. Regrettably, most human rights advocates and critics of the campaign against illegal drugs seem only interested in blaming the government. The drug syndicates, including their pushers, are not harmless. And the harsh reality is that there are crooked policemen and corrupt politicians who are helping or enabling the illegal drug trade. That makes the job even harder for law enforcers, the majority of whom are honest and committed to serving and protecting the people. Until today, the illicit drug trade is thriving, at least based on the large busts reported in the news. The Marcos government has vowed to continue the campaign against illegal drugs, although President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said that he wanted to target the syndicate bosses. We hope the government succeeds. But the recent conviction of the police officers is a reminder of how tough and complex the challenge will be.  ",0
The Manila Times,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go has renewed his call for the creation of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a Medical Reserve Corps to improve the country's capability in dealing with health crises. Go is pushing two measures to accomplish the objective, first is Senate Bill (SB) 195, under which some of the proposed major functions of the CDC will include investigating potential cases of public health emergency; enforcing regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases; procuring and distributing vaccines, antibiotics and other medical supplies; and working with other countries and international organizations to improve disease prevention and control systems and practices. Meanwhile, SB 1180, or the proposed ""Medical Reserve Corps Act of 2022,"" seeks to establish a Medical Reserve Corps composed of licensed physicians, nurses, medical technologists, persons who have degrees in the field of medicine, nursing, medical technology and other health-related fields, members of the Reserve Force of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the Medical Service, and administrative and technical personnel. Go added that the proposed CDC will not replace the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). ""It is important that we continue to support the RITM and let us study carefully the harmonization and delineation of the functions of the agencies,"" said Go during a Senate committee hearing on Thursday. The senator said the RITM will continue to exist to provide tertiary care to both inpatients and outpatients suffering from infectious diseases and regular training courses to medical and paramedical personnel. ""At the start of the pandemic, we depended on RITM for Covid-19 testing since they're the only one that has the capability then. In fact, the budget of RITM for 2020 was almost reduced during the budget deliberations in 2019. I opposed it and with the help of my colleagues in the Senate, we succeeded in increasing the budget of RITM,"" said Go. ""In other countries, the Centers for Disease Control have been instrumental in this pandemic. As experts in the field of infectious diseases, they are at the forefront of the health battle against Covid-19. It is high time for us to have our own CDC,"" he added.  ",0
The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. reaffirmed the Philippines' commitment to preserving strong ties with Japan as he expressed willingness to explore different areas of cooperation between the two nations. Marcos made the statement as he witnessed the conferment of The Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun to former Senate president Manuel Villar Jr. by the government of Japan in a ceremony in Malacañang on Friday. In his remarks, the President recognized Villar's significant contribution ""to the current strong bilateral relations between the Philippines and Japan."" He also expressed willingness ""to explore different areas of cooperation with Japan"" and affirmed his commitment ""to sustain the trajectory of diplomatic ties between the two nations."" Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Kazuhiko Koshikawa presented the award to Villar on behalf of the Emperor of Japan. The Order of the Rising Sun is a Japanese decoration of honor awarded by the government of Japan to individuals from both Japan and abroad who have made distinguished achievements in their field, as well as meritorious service and contributions to the advancement of Japan in a variety of areas, except military service. In April, the Japan government first announced Villar would be a recipient of the grand cordon in recognition of his contributions to strengthening economic bilateral relations between Japan and the Philippines. The embassy of Japan in Manila cited that the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement and the ""Protocol Amending the Convention Between Japan and the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Income Taxes"" were ratified in 2008 while Villar served as Senate president. Japan also commended Villar for supporting the ""Agreement on Technical Cooperation Between the Government of Japan and the Republic of the Philippines. ""Japan highly valued his efforts in supporting and promoting the bilateral and economic relations between Japan and the Philippines,"" the embassy said in a statement. Villar, for his part, expressed gratitude to Japanese Emperor Naruhito, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Koshikawa, and the people of Japan for ""this eminent decoration."" ""Most of all, I thank President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., our guest of honor, for joining me and my family on this special occasion. I am both humbled and deeply honored,"" he said. In another development on the diplomatic front, senior Philippine and Australian foreign affairs and defense officials convened at the Manila Diamond Hotel on Friday, Nov. 25, 2022, for the 6th Philippines-Australia Strategic Dialogue (PASD). Last held virtually in 2020, the PASD is the main forum for the two countries to discuss and coordinate strategic priorities and matters of mutual importance. Australia and the Philippines shared updates on their respective foreign and defense policies and priorities, took stock of progress made in important areas of the bilateral relationship, discussed upcoming activities, and shared views on regional dynamics. Both countries also discussed ways they could strengthen their foreign and defense cooperation and collaboration, in particular on maritime security as well as transnational crimes, both bilaterally and through multilateral organizations. Both countries expressed their ongoing commitment to supporting a rules-based regional order with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) at the center. Both sides also reaffirmed the importance of maritime cooperation activities, including the conduct of maritime dialogues, joint exercises, capacity-building activities, training, and logistics support, which show the common maritime perspectives underpinning the two countries' maritime cooperative endeavors. Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Bilateral Relations and Asean Affairs Ma. Theresa Lazaro and Department of National Defense Undersecretary for Civil, Veterans and Reserve Affairs Franco Nemesio Gacal led the Philippine delegation. Heading the Australian side were Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary for Southeast Asia and Global Partners Michelle Chan, and Department of Defense Acting Deputy Secretary for Strategy, Policy and Industry Hugh Jeffrey. The Philippines and Australia noted President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's agreement to strengthen ties between the countries by formally elevating the bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership.

The Manila Times,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go renewed his appeal to his fellow Filipinos to prioritize their health and wellbeing, especially amid the ongoing global health crisis, as he personally led the launch of the 153rd Malasakit Center in the country at the Overseas Filipino Workers Hospital and Diagnostic Center in San Fernando City, Pampanga on Thursday, November 24. The said Malasakit Center is the third such center established in the province. Other centers are located at Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital, also in San Fernando City, and at Rafael Lazatin Memorial Medical Center in Angeles City. In his speech, Go said the establishment of the Overseas Filipino Workers Hospital in the city demonstrates his and former president Rodrigo Duterte's commitment to improving the country's health care system and promoting the welfare of Filipino migrant workers and their families. ""This is for the poor and indigent patients. And I am happy that this 153rd Malasakit Center is here at the OFW Hospital, which is a dream come true for us,"" Go expressed. ""The creation of the Department of Migrant Workers is a dream come true for us. I am a co-sponsor and one of the authors of the measure... This was our dream, and it is now a reality,"" he shared. On May 1, Labor Day, this year, Go had joined former president Duterte in the inspection of the first-ever OFW Hospital in San Fernando City. ""The construction and establishment of the OFW Hospital is not only a dream come true but a fulfilled promise that serves as a testament to how much former president Duterte values the sacrifices and contributions of our beloved OFWs,"" the senator previously cited. Then president Duterte had signed Republic Act (RA) 11641 in December of last year, creating the DMW in a bid to improve coordination among agencies dealing with the concerns of Filipino migrant workers. The Senate version of the Act, Senate Bill (SB) 2234, was authored and co-sponsored by Go. It is a consolidated version of an earlier bill he introduced to establish the Department of Overseas Filipino Workers. Go initiated the Malasakit Centers program back in 2018, after he had personally witnessed the struggles and reluctance of financially incapacitated Filipinos to get the medical attention they need. The Malasakit Centers Act of 2019 mandates the establishment of one-stop shops that streamline the process of acquiring aid from concerned agencies, namely the Department of Health (DoH), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Philippine Health Insurance Corp., and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Its primary aim is to reduce a hospital bill to the lowest amount possible by covering various patient services and fees. Go also said that through the joint efforts with the DoH, the OFW Hospital will be granted adequate funds that would support and further enhance the said facility. After the launch, Go and his team distributed shirts, masks, vitamins and meals to 49 outpatients and 194 medical frontliners. Meanwhile, the DSWD extended financial assistance to the outpatients and 89 other rank-and-file employees of the hospital. Bicycles, cellular phones and shoes were also given to select individuals. Meanwhile, the senator commended all medical frontliners for their immeasurable service and dedication to serve ailing Filipinos during the global health crisis. Go reiterated his pledge to continue promoting their welfare. He was instrumental in the passage of the Salary Standardization Law 5 which gives nurses and other civilian government employees their fifth round of salary increases. Earlier that day, Go personally assisted vulnerable students in the town of Minalin. The senator then inspected the Super Health Center in San Fernando City and provided aid to the city's indigents.

The Manila Times,"THE Philippine Postal Corp. (PHLPost) will soon roll out a new generation of stamps and postcards in a bid to attract the so-called digital natives to discover and embrace the old art of stamp collecting. Postmaster General Norman Fulgencio announced this on Friday during the unveiling of a special stamp featuring the late president Fidel V. Ramos (FVR). He said stamps and postcards play a key role in nation-building as the new sets being issued by PHLPost ""[recognizes] the most valuable asset of our country — the Filipino people and promoting Philippine tourism and economy."" ""Our stamps are not only meant to commemorate our rich history and culture, but they are also our way to celebrate and thank our best, brightest and most patriotic Filipinos who have brought honor and joy to our nation,"" Fulgencio said. The postmaster general also announced the opening of a ""more modern"" Postal Museum in December and the unveiling early next year of the Mabuhay Pilipinas stamps which will showcase the country's diverse culture, language, food and tourist destinations. At the unveiling of the special FVR stamps, Fulgencio gave tribute to the nation's 12th president who passed away in July. He said as someone who has a deep knowledge of stamp collecting, FVR has declared November of every year as National Stamp Collecting Month through Presidential Proclamation 494. ""President Ramos, a certified stamp collector himself, recognized that the collection and study of stamps will provide our people, especially the youth, with deeper knowledge of our history, culture and traditions, as well as of the rest of the world,"" Fulgencio said. ""President Ramos acknowledged the fact that stamps will never lose their value, instead would become even more meaningful because they give us a deeper understanding and connection with our nation's history, culture and economy,"" he added. Fulgencio said Ramos was instrumental in the promotion of philately, the study and collection of stamps. ""Apart from his popular hobby, the post office pays tribute and celebrate the legacy of public service he has imparted to each one of us,"" he pointed out. Fulgencio noted that with his presidential proclamation, former president Ramos was able to propagate and promote the art of philately to Filipinos, especially the youth. ""This is the post office's way of reaffirming our appreciation and support to one of the indelible legacies of our revered FVR,"" he said. Fulgencio said that it is the mandate of the PHLPost to immortalize and pay tribute to former presidents who served and contributed to the development of the country. He stressed that the postage stamps that were issued ""symbolize unity, respect and love of the country.""  ",0
The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Friday congratulated his ""good friend"" Anwar Ibrahim for becoming Malaysia's 10th prime minister.

""I just wanted to be — to immediately — to be one of the first to congratulate you because I'm very happy to hear the news. I was very happy to hear the news and I wanted to congratulate you immediately myself,"" he told Ibrahim. ""I am sure this will make Malaysia and the Philippines even closer because we will be in touch with one another,"" he said. Ibrahim pledged Malaysia's commitment to strengthen ties with the Philippines in different areas such as trade and investment. ""As founding fathers of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), our two nations have always enjoyed strong cooperation in bilateral, regional and multilateral forums,"" he said. In response, the President pointed out that a strong relationship between the Philippines and Malaysia is imperative ""because of all the problems that the two nations are facing."" ""We have to really work together, otherwise, we will not be able to get over this crisis of inflation, of the agricultural commodities, all of that.

The Manila Times,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday said he wanted to more public-private partnerships in the health care sector to expand access to higher-quality health services in the country. In a meeting with representatives of the healthcare cluster of the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC), Marcos said a public-private partnership coupled with strong third-party assessments would ""address efficiency concerns in dealing with the health needs of Filipinos."" He directed the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) to review the ""best practices"" on improving health insurance operations and offering health benefits through digitalization initiatives. In 2019, the Department of health launched its first public-private partnership project which aims to strengthen the implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law. Meanwhile, Marcos renewed his call to find ways to entice Filipino nurses and other health professionals to stay in the country ""You can't hold people back from a better life, a better future... It's fair that you provide scholarships. We just have to find ways to keep them here,"" he said. He earlier supported a proposal to implement a ""ladderized"" program to address the ""brain drain"" among nurses in the country. A ladderized programs allow students to finish a short course, go out and work, and then return for a more advanced course or college degree. Marcos also backed the passage of House Bill 9389 or the New Philippine Nursing Practice Act which seeks to institute reforms to further protect and develop the nursing profession in the country. DOH officer-in-charge Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said the government is looking at ""bilateral partners"" to provide scholarship programs for medical students and professionals. ""Part of these discussions would be that with our bilateral relationships... we will have exchange programs or exchange conditions,"" Vergeire said. She said enhancing scholarship programs for Filipino health care workers is also vital to addressing the concerns in the healthcare workforce.  ",0
The Manila Times,"Education stakeholders and other members of the academe here convened on Saturday, November 19, kicking off a pre-education summit organized by the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Led by Minister Mohagher Iqbal of the Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education (MBHTE), the event is designed specifically for education stakeholders in Cotabato City. In an interview, Iqbal said local school boards can meaningfully contribute to a bigger regional education summit slated on Dec. 5-6, 2022, in Davao City. ""The Schools Division of Cotabato City is ever ready and passionate among other divisions to instill the battlecry for the Bangsamoro learners na walang batang Bangsamoro na mapag-iiwanan (that no Bangsamoro children will be left behind) In Shaa Allah,"" according to the MBHTE minister.

The Manila Times,"THE Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) on Thursday issued a warning against an online illegal recruitment scheme perpetrated by a Chinese-run offshore gaming company operating along the border of Myanmar and Thailand. ""The Department of Migrant Workers has issued an advisory against online offers for temporary work in Myanmar for POGO-run establishments that are really forced labor and human trafficking hubs in disguise,"" DWM Secretary Susan Ople said, adding the group was offering customer service relations or technical support jobs to Filipinos. Ople said she interviewed 10 victims that were supposed to work in a Chinese call center in Myanmar near the border of Thailand. A total of 12 people were rescued from their Chinese handlers through the coordinated efforts of the office of Sen. Ana Theresia ""Risa"" Hontiveros, the DMW and the Department of Foreign Affairs. ""Our department wishes to thank Sen. Risa Hontiveros. It was actually a communication between one of the victims and the staff of Senator Risa that triggered a lot of things. She met one of the victims yesterday and I met around 10 of the human trafficking survivors,"" Ople added. The victims said they were recruited online via Facebook and promised a monthly salary of P40,000 for six months as data encoders, customer service relations and technical support staff. Their recruiter said they would be working in Thailand but ended up in a ""techno park"" in a remote area in Myanmar, which took them eight hours to reach by road trip and hiking. The victims said each of them was assigned a work cubicle where they search and cultivate relations with potential bitcoin investors using dating apps and other social media platforms. They said they managed to understand instructions in Chinese by using Google Translate. ""These Chinese syndicates run sleek operations, and I will not be surprised if there are syndicates also operating in remote areas here in the Philippines,"" Ople said. Acting Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Administrator and DMW Undersecretary Bernard Olalia signed Advisory 54 on Aug. 2, 2022, suspending any further deployment of Filipino workers to Myanmar due to the ongoing armed conflict and rising incidents of illegal recruitment and human trafficking in the country. The DMW's Anti-Illegal Recruitment Branch is working with the Philippine National Police's Women and Children Protection Center in documenting the testimonies of the victims for the filing of human trafficking and illegal recruitment cases against the perpetrators. The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration provided the rescued victims overnight accommodation, a financial help of P10,000 and air transit for those returning to the provinces.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), upon the instruction of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., on Wednesday sent a note verbale to China to ""clarify"" the reported tension between the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) and Philippine Navy (PN) over a rocket debris. Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said that the Philippine government sent a note verbale to China to clarify the recent ""tug-of-war"" incident between the CCG and PN off Pag-asa Island over the retrieval of a rocket debris. ""In fact, even before that, we were studying the incident and also have been in and are continuing to be in close coordination with the other Philippine government agencies who are also looking into this,"" Manalo said in a television interview. ""We have issued a note verbale already seeking clarification from China on the incident. We, of course, have our own reports but we would like to hear it from the side of China."" ""We will continue monitoring this incident, and we'll see what further diplomatic action might be needed,"" Manalo said. Sought for reaction, the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines merely said, ""Noted with thanks."" DFA spokesman Ma. Teresita Daza said that as of November 22, the Philippine government has issued 189 diplomatic protests to the Chinese Embassy in Manila — 61 of which ""were made during the current administration."" The protests were ""against [Chinese] incursions, illegal presence in our waters, harassment of supply missions to Ayungin [Shoal],"" Daza said in a text message to The Manila Times when asked about the nature of the diplomatic protests. The Philippine military ran the BRP Sierra Madre aground in the Second Thomas Shoal or Ayungin Shoal, 196 kilometers from Palawan, in response to China's illegal occupation of Mischief Reef. The BRP Sierra Madre, a commissioned Philippine Naval vessel, has hosted a small contingent of military personnel to assert Manila's claim to the disputed waters. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the report that the CCG blocked the PN's course twice and forcefully snatched away the rocket debris that the PN retrieved off Pag-asa. ""After friendly consultation, the Philippine side returned the floating object to the Chinese side on the spot. The Chinese side expressed gratitude to the Philippine side,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. But the Defense department stood by the report that the rocket debris was forcibly taken from Filipino troops.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen has urged law schools to instill reforms and “move away from being elaborate bar review centers.” “Instead, it should also add two important competencies: skills to practice and advocate, as well as critical legal thinking skills that will allow more lawyers to make the law more legible in the context of our own society,” Leonen said in his keynote speech during the 2022 National Legal Aid Summit held in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, last Nov. 27 to Nov. 30. Leonen also said that the legal profession “should be encouraged to be sensitive to and evolve more public interest cases in the proper way. This requires the skills to communicate with and empower those who are marginalized and oppressed.” “Perhaps, then, with the collective efforts of the members of the court, we can provide more than just the rule of law, but the rule of justice. Perhaps, then, we do not contribute to the disempowerment of the already weak, marginalized and the oppressed. We do not maintain inequality,” he said. Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, meanwhile, emphasized the importance of legal aid in the nobility of the legal profession, saying that the legal profession is a noble one as it is used to secure peace and order in society through the preservation of the rule of law. “Lawyering does not give us entitlement. Lawyering thrives on truth, not on lies. Lawyering does not exploit a person’s ignorance. On the contrary, it looks after the disadvantaged and the marginalized, in order to give them a voice, to give them the chance to be equal with others, if not in life, at least in law.”",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Philippines’ largest business management group is pushing for amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) law, which governs public-private partnerships (PPP) projects, with plans in place to form a new multisectoral committee to address issues with the said law. Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) president Rogelio Singson said last Monday there are numerous problems with the BOT law, adding that the business group wants government to address lingering concerns from the private sector. “We cannot have indefinite discussions on provisions of contracts just because there’s a new administration [which means] all the contracts will have to be reviewed again,” Singson said at the sidelines of the group’s annual membership meeting in Taguig. Asked about the priority concerns of their group, the MAP official said that regulatory issues, as well as the government respecting past contracts were top priorities. Singson cited in particular issues in the water sector that should be addressed promptly by the government. “Who is the current regulator? It’s not clear. Is it the [Local Water Utilities Administration]? Is it the [local government unit] or the National Water Resources Board? Those have to be defined by the law,” Singson said. “There are many things we could accomplish with PPP, but let’s clarify the roles, the responsibilities,” he added. Singson said that the outgoing board has approved the proposed creation of a MAP-led committee to tackle PPP issues and concerns. “This committee, as discussed and agreed with the PPP Center, will be multisectoral, which will include the PPP Center, MAP, the League of Governors, the League of Mayors and PPP industry players,” Singson said. Earlier in September, a Cabinet-level committee approved revisions to the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the amended BOT law, paving the way for big-ticket infrastructure projects that could be pursued in partnership with the private sector. Later, in October of this year, the government’s PPP Center said it was pushing for amendments that were left unaddressed in the latest revisions in the IRR. PPP Center executive director Ma. Cynthia Hernandez said that among the issues they plan to address is the removal of the P300 million cap on projects that are evaluated by the Cabinet-level Investment Coordination Committee. The removal of the cap will take away limitations on certain implementing agencies, according to Hernandez.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Wednesday said that the government aims to raise an estimated $3 billion through the issuance of dollar-denominated retail bonds targeting overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). According to Diokno, the government plans to launch the said retail bonds in the first quarter of 2023. “We’re launching it in the first quarter of next year,” said Diokno during a Kapihan sa Maynila Bay forum. When asked how much they aim to raise, Diokno said, “siguro mga (maybe about) 10 percent of the annual inflow, which is about $3 billion.” However, Diokno said they are still finalizing the terms of how the government will offer the said retail bonds to OFWs. He said OFWs can invest as low as $200. Diokno clarified that the estimated amount to be raised may still change. “That’s just a notional number. It can be one ($1 billion), it can be three ($3 billion), that depends on the demand of the OFWs,” said Diokno. To recall, Diokno announced that the national government was considering floating US dollar-denominated retail bonds as early as December 2022. He said this would lead to further growth in cash remittances, which is expected to help shore up the Philippine peso, which has depreciated since June.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Disinformation has virtually split the Philippines into “multiverses” that have their own versions of realities and “facts,” former Vice President Leni Robredo said on Tuesday, as she urged Filipinos to combat fake news not just through fact-checking but also rebuilding trust among one another. During her keynote address in a forum hosted by Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) Asia — one of several speaking engagements during a brief return to Manila — Robredo said that segments of society now exist “with their own facts, their own experts, their own narratives of Philippine history and society.” “We are now a nation split into camps and echo chambers,” she said. “It’s like we live in multiverses [that] have separate histories, truths and beliefs, [and] at the end of it all, an alternate reality is created, one which seems impenetrable and impervious to logic.” Since stepping down from the vice presidency, Robredo — named in several studies as the No. 1 target of disinformation in the country — vowed to take the lead in the fight against fake news. In the past few months, she had spoken at several Ivy League universities about how disinformation has eroded the Philippines’ democratic institutions and deepened political divides. This splintering, she said, was due in large part to the “architecture of disinformation networks” seeking to push their own agendas and erode public discourse. Free data promos Robredo was referring to a concept coined by disinformation scholars Jonathan Ong and Nicole Curato, whose studies revealed how advertising and PR firms, as well as political operatives, influencers and trolls, all work in concert to seed disinformation and agitate people. Bias in social media algorithms and even free data promos provided by telecommunications providers have also greatly narrowed Filipinos’ access to diverse streams of information, she added. In particular, the free data promos that allow Filipinos to access Facebook and TikTok—two platforms that have been flagged for disinformation—essentially narrowed people’s access to more information. “Free access to social media can seem like a good deal until one realizes, since Facebook is free, sites like Google, or the Inquirer, and the Philippine Star, and other mainstream media outlets which are not available on free data, that regulators have handed over a near-monopoly to these platforms — platforms that have algorithmic bias and can be gamed,” she said. “Now, whatever it is that’s on free data, that’s their only source of information. They can no longer access more legitimate sources of information,” she added. “That is why the influence of the legitimate media is not the same as before. Trolls, who work for the highest bidders, have the same influence if not more than trained journalists who follow codes of ethics.” Tide can be turned Still, Robredo was confident that the tide can be turned “when actions are rooted in accountability and action.” “If the grand strategy of disinformation actors is to stop us from talking to each other, then countering disinformation should be to talk to each other again,” she said. More than fact-checking initiatives, she said, people should work on “rebuilding structures that enable meaningful public discourse.” She also called on social media giants to take responsibility for the networks that thrived under their watch and to come together with civil society groups for solutions. Ultimately, she said, “we must pull back and situate each lie within the bigger process of disinformation and talk about who is benefiting from disinformation: every story, every lie.” “Rather than get bogged down engaging in combat with each troll we find, we must focus our efforts upstream and holding architects of disinformation accountable, she added.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Commission on Appointments (CA) on Tuesday approved the ad interim appointment of Susan “Toots” Ople as the first head of the newly created Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) after a hearing that lasted just over an hour. In her appearance before the panel, Ople vowed to help the DMW fulfill its mandate of bringing a stronger mantle of protection for more than 10.5 million overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) spread in various countries all over the world. Ople said her confirmation will allow her to fly to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia next week to visit OFW shelters there and discuss pending claims of around 10,000 displaced workers, and to look at potential job opportunities “with greater safeguards against abuse and exploitation.” Ople, daughter of the late Blas Ople who served as labor secretary and Senate President in the 70s and 80s, was lauded by CA members as the “best person” to lead the DMW.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Former Department of Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, who sued several media outfit in 2021 for reporting “libelous and false statements” on his involvement in the controversial Malampaya deal, is now facing a cyberlibel charge after Valenzuela prosecutors indicted him over his statement against Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian’s handling of the Senate investigation on the issue. In a 20-page resolution dated Nov. 14, Valenzuela Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Rudy Ricamora recommended that Cusi be indicted for violation of the Cyber Crime Prevention Act of 2012. The case stemmed from Cusi’s statement that Gatchalian “had chosen to lend his ear to those adversarial business interests.” In indicting Cusi, the prosecutors said his statement “certainly ascribes no other meaning than dishonesty, fraud and abuse of power on the part of Gatchalian.” In his defense, Cusi argued that his statement was not defamatory nor malicious, as he was just criticizing the conduct of the Senate inquiry.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"What’s Filipino for “predatory”? Banks and lending companies may have to strengthen their command of Filipino or other Philippine languages if Congress passes a new bill requiring financial institutions to use the vernacular in banking documents.  Under House Bill No. 6340, Camarines Sur Rep. Arnulf Bryan Fuentebella proposes that all banks, lending companies and other financial institutions be compelled to use the local language in contracts, loan agreements and other documents to protect vulnerable Filipinos from deceptive and unfair transactions. The lawmaker noted that despite more than 88 percent of Filipinos being able to speak and write in English, “there remains a minority who have yet to be proficient or have a full understanding of the language.” Fuentebella said: “Online lending platforms and contracts/agreements for loans and financing usually utilize the English language to contract with their borrowers, which hinders a full understanding of the terms and conditions contained in such agreements and online lending platforms.”  Deceptive, unfair sales acts’ In coming up with the proposal, the congressman cited the public interest involved in the lending and financing industry and the state’s duty to protect the public from “deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practices as well as to facilitate the proper exercise of rights of the consumer.” Fuentebella said his bill seeks to mandate “all banks, lending and financing corporations, quasi-banks, cooperatives offering loans, and microfinance nongovernment organizations to use loan contracts in the Filipino language or in a language used in the locality where the said corporation operates.” Banks and other financial institutions would also be required to clearly explain the terms and conditions of a deal and ensure that these are fully understood. The Philippines has more than 100 languages, and Filipino, a standardized form of Tagalog, is the national language. Filipino is also one of the country’s two official languages, along with English. Fines, other penalties Under the bill, noncompliant financing companies face a fine of P10,000 on the first offense, P50,000 on the second offense; a P100,000 fine and suspension of the secondary license issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) or the Microfinance NGO Regulatory Council on the third offense; and P200,000 for subsequent offenses along with revocation of their license. HB 6340 mandates the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to work with the Department of Finance, the CDA, and the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino in crafting the implementing rules and regulations. The DTI and the CDA shall also be tasked to submit an annual compliance progress report to Congress.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"To facilitate economic operations in the Philippines, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is expected to sign an exec tive order (EO) establishing a “green lane” for strategic investments. According to the Office of the Press Secretary, the pathway will make the co ntry competitive with other So theast Asian nations in attracting foreign direct investments (FDIs). The move, the OPS said, comes after the Department of Trade and Ind stry (DTI) presented to the President the proposed EO on creating a “green lane” for strategic investments and identified the barrier across m ltiple reg latory agencies that hamper the entry of FDIs in the country. The EO will mandate concerned agencies to establish a “green lane” to expedite and streamline the process and req irements for iss ing permits and licenses, incl ding resolving iss es concerning strategic investments. It will cover all national government agencies and their regional and provincial offices, local government  nits and q asi-j dicial bodies involved in iss ing permits and licenses necessary for establishing strategic investment projects in the co ntry. These agencies are mandated to act on b siness applications no longer than three working days in the case of simple transactions; seven working days for complex transactions, and 20 working days for highly technical transactions from the date of receipt. “This is a big thing. It will address the ease of doing b siness that firms have been complaining abo t  s,” Marcos told DTI officials d ring a meeting in Malacañan Palace, as q oted by the OPS.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Efforts to distort the late Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.’s legacy in history textbooks and films are attempts to “kill him over again,” a group of Filipino-American Edsa veterans said on Monday, a day after the 90th birth anniversary of the late senator. The US Filipinos for Good Governance said it “broke their heart” to see how, even in death, Aquino was being branded by loyalists as a murderer and a communist sympathizer in an attempt to diminish his place in Philippine history. Eric Lachica of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans said these pernicious attacks against Aquino is what allowed disinformation about martial law and allowed the Marcoses to thrive. The group lamented how martial law was being painted as a rosy era in Philippine textbooks, and how certain factions are seeking to have his name erased from the eponymous Ninoy Aquino International Airport where he was assassinated in 1983 upon his return from self-exile in the United States. Recently, controversial filmmaker and known loyalist Darryl Yap also teased a possible new film, “Martyr or Murderer,” which would supposedly depict the truth about the Marcoses’ role in Aquino’s assassination. “Ninoy is dead and all the people are trying to kill him over again,” said Lupita Aquino Kashiwahara, Aquino’s sister and retired filmmaker. “There’s a climate of fear because dictatorship is again on the horizon.” Even so, the group found solace in how Aquino waged a lonely but fierce battle against the dictatorship even while he was in self-exile in the United States at the tail end of the Marcos regime. “The struggle for a cause, when launched from a distance, can be a long drawn-out effort,” said Jose Fuentecilla, former Movement for a Free Philippines leader. “We need to continue the fight just as he did.”",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Probinsyano Ako Rep. Rudys Caesar Fariñas I is pushing for the creation of a police force that is dedicated to ensuring the safety of all members of Congress, as well as protecting the properties of both chambers. has filed House Bill (HB) No. 6253, which seeks to establish the Philippine Legislative Police (PLP). His measure is a refiled version of HB 6208 filed in the 17th Congress by his father, former Ilocos Rep. Rodolfo Fariñas. In the bill’s explanatory note, Fariñas said Congress relies on law enforcement agencies under the executive branch to enforce and execute its contempt orders and arrest warrants. “As such, Congress is helpless to do anything if the Philippine National Police and other law enforcement agencies, which Congress has commissioned to enforce and execute its orders, are negligent of their assigned duties,” the lawmaker said. He added: “The reliance of Congress on the law enforcement agencies of the executive department in the protection of its members and the enforcement and execution of its powers impair, to a large extent, the independence of Congress from the executive department.” HB 6253 proposes the creation of a PLP under Congress’ control and supervision, which will be primarily tasked to protect Congress’ members and its properties. The PLP will also be tasked to maintain peace and order, conduct patrol, communications and intelligence gathering, prevent crimes and arrest criminal offenders within the jurisdiction of Congress, and serve subpoenas and warrants that Congress may issue.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Three members of a Protestant church on Monday sought Supreme Court protection from alleged red-tagging and harassment by top officials of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly a division of the Philippine Army, while they also named the military chief as respondent on the basis of command responsibility. Couple Edwin and Julieta Egar, both pastors of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), and lay leader Ronald Ramos filed a petition for writ of amparo and a temporary protection order against the military brass. A writ of amparo is a remedy available to any person whose right to life, liberty and security is violated or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity. The petitioners claimed they were accused of “giving aid to communist insurgents” and were included in a list of alleged New People’s Army (NPA) rebels by a division of the Philippine Army. Named respondents in the 62-page petition were AFP Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Bartolome Vicente Bacarro, Philippine Army commander Lt. Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., 2nd Infantry Division commander Maj. Gen. Roberto Capulong, 59th Infantry Battalion (IB) commander Lt. Col. Ernesto Teneza Jr., Sergeants Ronald Dalo and John Granpil, Private First Class Borge Ebol, and respondents Roy dela Peña and Bong Samela, among others. ‘Outright threat’ In their petition, the Egars and Ramos claimed that, “in doing their ministry work for the [G]ospel, [they were] falsely alleged, despite the utter lack of evidence, to be giving aid to communist insurgents by the respondent… officers and enlisted personnel of the 59th Infantry “Protector” Battalion stationed in Rosario, Batangas[,] and in the various 59th IB detachments across Quezon province and Batangas.” The petition alleged further that the 59th IB “conducted military surveillance/military reconnoiter of petitioners despite petitioners being civilians [and] intimidated and gravely coerced [them] to surrender and admit [to] being…(NPA) members despite the lack of any evidence and their outright refusal to divulge alleged evidence.” “[T]here is an outright threat of a military operation directed against [our] li[ves], liberty and security,” the petitioners said. They added: “Due to these illegal military surveillance, unwarranted visits, threats of illegal searches, and the outright threat of a deadly military operation akin to the Bloody Sunday operations, the respondent… officers and enlisted personnel of the 59th IB have implanted a genuine and crippling fear in the minds of petitioners.” The Egar couple and Ramos were referring to the simultaneous police and military operations on March 7, 2021, which led to the killing of nine activists—an episode since called “Bloody Sunday.” “Now, the petitioners are living in fear wondering whether tomorrow will be their last. They have also yet to be able to return to their homes for fear that instead of [residing] in a safe haven, they would be endangering themselves more by being open targets for the respondent… officers and enlisted personnel of the 59th IB,” the petition said. Gilbert Andres, one of the lawyers from the Center for International Law whom the petitioners sought to represent them, claimed that Ramos had received text messages warning him that “there would be a military-police operation like the Bloody Sunday military operation.” Andres also noted that his client is a former barangay captain. Enumerated in Ramos’ petition together with the Egars were several instances which allegedly showed the respondents threatening or intimidating him—such as “[R]ed-tagging… through [his] inclusion… in a list of ‘persons of interest [by] the military,’” as also posted on the Facebook page of the 59th IB; the respondents’ “insistence that he surrender… and admit that he is a member of the NPA”; and “the constant and consistent refusal of the respondents to show [him] any documentation to substantiate their [R]ed-tagging.” In their appeal for a temporary protection order, the petitioners asked the high court to bar the respondents from entering a one-kilometer radius of their residence or work address and from communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioners. They requested further the protection of their families by a private institution capable of securing their safety. The petitioners also asked the court to direct the respondents or anybody who has evidence relevant to their petition to produce such evidence and allow its examination by the high court. Furthermore, the petitioners requested that the military be directed to investigate the respondents in the petition and reassign them outside Batangas province. Members of the UCCP accompanied Julieta Egar, who was the only petitioner present at the Supreme Court, as they held a prayer session outside the court premises. The Inquirer reached out to Bacarro and Brawner for comment on Monday but they had yet to respond as of 8 p.m. The AFP Public Affairs Office said “We haven’t received yet the formal copy of the petition. In the meantime, we will look at the allegations and will answer in the proper forum.”",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A businessman from Mindanao said he lost over P5 million to a group of people who offered him a cut of P700 million from the sale of over P17-trillion worth of “Marcoses’ gold” allegedly being kept inside the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Jericho (not his real name), an admitted supporter of the Marcos family, said he fell for the dubious deal because those behind it were in their 80s and presented so many seemingly legitimate company and government ID cards. “Because they were old, I felt assured that they could be trusted. In my thinking, they were old so it’s impossible for them to do wrong,” he said. Jericho said he eventually became suspicious when he saw that the certificate of ownership of the gold presented by one of the members of the group identified then BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno as Benjamin Diokno Santiago. Their repeated demands for more money also added to his doubts about the deal. In a complaint filed in the National Bureau of Investigation, Jericho identified the head of the group as Aniano Gemina, who claimed to be the CEO of a borrowing company, Real Mines Development Corp. Jericho said Gemina asked him for P5 million to renew a “safekeeping receipt” supposedly certifying that the company owned the Marcos gold kept inside the BSP. ‘Opportunity’ According to Gemina, the receipt was being required by the BSP for the deal with Haggai Precious Metals Trading Corp. which was transacting with his company to buy the gold for P17 trillion. “Gemina told me, ‘This wealth is [owned by the Marcoses]. It’s just [in my name].’ That’s where it started, I thought it was an opportunity,” Jericho said, adding that he was promised P700 million once the deal pushed through. He said he agreed to pay the P5 million as long as the transaction was done inside the BSP building. The signing of the “contract,” however, plus the turnover of the money took place in a private restaurant in Malate, Manila, on June 30, 2021. President Marcos Jr. has long debunked claims of a repository of gold as his family’s supposed source of wealth. According to an urban legend, the Tallano royal family entrusted gold bars to his family.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Congress should consider restoring the “full control, instead of mere supervision” of the Department of Justice (DOJ) over the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), according to former Justice Secretary and now Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra. “[M]ost of the shenanigans at the BuCor are very deeply rooted and institutionalized. It really needs total overhaul,” Guevarra told reporters. The bureau has recently been in the spotlight following reports about the alleged involvement of its suspended chief, BuCor Director General Gerald Bantag, in a series of controversies. Bantag is facing murder complaints for the deaths of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa and New Bilibid Prison (NBP) inmate Cristito Villamor Palaña, supposedly one of two middlemen in the plot to kill the broadcaster. According to Guevarra, who served as DOJ chief from 2018 until his appointment as Solicitor General by President Marcos in July this year, BuCor became autonomous under Republic Act No. 10575 or the BuCor Act of 2013. BuCor’s joint venture “The DOJ now merely supervises, but does not exercise control over the BuCor. But still the DOJ steps in whenever the BuCor exceeds the limits of its powers,” he said. In a previous interview, Guevarra said the law that diminished the DOJ’s control over the bureau may have to be reviewed. Some of the things that were accomplished in BuCor during his term as DOJ secretary were fixing the good conduct time allowance rules and the single “carpeta” (prison records) system, and including persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) in the COVID-19 vaccination program. Guevarra said he also ordered BuCor to put a stop to gang wars and the construction of “kubol” or makeshift dwellings, and tempered the bureau’s actions prohibiting the passage of residents near the NBP. In addition, he recommended the disapproval of BuCor’s joint venture agreement with Agua Tierra Oro Mina Development (Atom) Corp. for noncompliance with legal requirements, among other supervisory actions. “Sadly, however, the huge excavation inside the NBP was purposely hidden from the knowledge of the DOJ,” Guevarra said, referring to diggings inside the prison reservation that were exposed recently by Bantag’s successor, BuCor officer in charge Gregorio Catapang Jr. Guevarra earlier said he had “absolutely no knowledge about this alleged excavation.” “The same being an operational matter, the BuCor probably did not find it necessary to inform, much less seek authorization from the DOJ,” he added. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla had said in a previous news briefing that during Bantag’s term, BuCor entered into a memorandum of agreement and joint venture deal with Atom Corp. for a project that would supposedly decongest the state penitentiary and earn revenues for the bureau. Under the deal, Atom Corp. would donate 234 hectares of land to BuCor and put up buildings to relocate 28,000 PDLs or inmates of NBP. In return, the company would develop the 375-hectare NBP Reservation in Muntinlupa City into a commercial, residential and industrial area. Possible violations Remulla had said that he was opposed to the idea of transferring a megaprison to another facility. “I was never keen on that plan because as secretary of justice, I have to look at the overall future of our correction system. I am not project-bound… I will look into the universe of the problem, that’s why we have regionalization [and] decongestion. These are proactive measures to improve the correction system,” he said. He added that he had ordered his staff to look into the possible violations committed by Bantag in connection with the huge excavation at NBP. Remulla said Bantag had admitted to him that he had the area dug up for treasure hunting. But Bantag denied this in public, insisting that the excavation was for the construction of a deep swimming pool where prison personnel could be trained in scuba diving so that they could be tapped in rescue operations during calamities.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Warning that ordinary consumers risked paying higher electricity prices, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Sunday said he hoped the Court of Appeals (CA) would reconsider its issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) suspending the implementation of the power supply agreement (PSA) between South Premiere Power Corp. (SPPC), a unit of conglomerate San Miguel Corp. (SMC), and Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). “[Regarding] the [TRO on the] implementation of the PSA between Meralco and San Miguel, it is unfortunate that this has happened, [as] it will cause further dislocations and possible price increase for power,” the president said in a statement. “We hope that the CA will reconsider. And include in their deliberations the extremely deleterious effect this will have on power prices for ordinary Filipinos,” he added. The TRO request stemmed from the Energy Regulatory Commission’s (ERC) rejection of the joint SMC-Meralco petition for a 30-centavo per kilowatt-hour increase to offset soaring fuel prices as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. SMC had argued that there was a “change in circumstance” after the PSA was signed in 2019, citing skyrocketing coal and fuel prices. Due to the surge in the cost of imported coal, for example, it became more expensive to operate its power plant. But it was unable to pass on the added cost to consumers because the ERC rejected its proposed rate increase. From 2021, SMC said its power entities had so far incurred P15 billion in losses for operating its coal-fired power plant in Sual, Pangasinan, and its natural gas-fed facility in Ilijan, Batangas. The regulatory body, in its Sept. 29 order, ruled that the agreed price in the PSA was fixed in nature, and the grounds for increase cited by SPPC and Meralco were not among the exceptions that would allow for a price adjustment. 60-day effectivity SMC appealed the ERC rejection and the CA last week granted the TRO requested by SMC. This move could lead to a spike in the monthly power bills of Meralco customers, a concern raised by the ERC. The ERC cited a portion of the CA ruling dated Nov. 23: “… in view of the circumstances and the interest of the general public, this court grants the TRO and hereby suspends the implementation of the PSA. The TRO shall be effective for a period of 60 days from service on respondents.” ERC Chair Monalisa Dimalanta expressed “grave concern on the instantaneous effect” of the temporary suspension of supply agreements. In a statement, she said this would expose about 7.5 million Meralco customers in Metro Manila and adjacent areas to higher electricity prices as the fixed rates in the current PSAs would no longer be enforced. According to the regulatory body, the fixed-price PSA of Meralco with SPPC covered 670 megawatts (MW) of supply and Dimalanta stressed that such agreements “have been shielding Meralco consumers for the past several months from the volatility of prices from WESM (Wholesale Electricity Spot Market) and automatic fuel pass-through PSAs.” Nonetheless, the ERC expressed confidence that the CA “will accord great respect, if not finality, to the regulator’s factual findings because of its special expertise over the energy sector.” With the suspension of the PSA due to the TRO, Meralco might be forced to buy more expensive electricity to supply customers in its franchise area. Meralco said it would consult its counsel to explore the next steps in light of the CA decision and would follow up with the Department of Energy (DOE) on its prior request to immediately secure additional power supply without going through the required competitive selection process (CSP). “We have written the DOE to follow up on our previous letter requesting for CSP exemption of certain emergency PSAs to shield our customers against volatile and potentially higher WESM prices,” said Jose Ronald Valles, first vice president and head of regulatory management of Meralco. Opposing views Consumer group Power for People Coalition (P4P) had lambasted the CA for what it described as an “illogical and anticonsumer” resolution on the issue. “The TRO is absurd and rash. It suspended the PSA between SMC and Meralco, which governs how SMC can supply Meralco with electricity and how much SMC can charge,” Gerry Arances, P4P convener, said in a statement. Terry Ridon, convener of Infrawatch PH, a think tank focusing on resolving infrastructure underdevelopment in power, transport, telecommunications, water, public works, and natural resources, said the president should allow full judicial proceedings to take their course and “his views may ably be represented through ERC lawyers and the Solicitor General.” Ridon added that the TRO would allow continuing discussions on the fair and reasonable rates which could be imposed on the Meralco franchise area given elevated fuel and coal prices in the last few months. “This provides a way forward toward a determination on whether the price proposal in the joint petition constitutes the least cost to consumers in comparison to other prospective proposals extraneous to the current power supply agreement, such as prices through emergency procurement or the spot market,” Ridon added. According to Dimalanta, the ERC would defer to the appellate court on their next move, but it already referred the issue to the Office of the Solicitor General. The decision of the ERC rejecting the joint petition of SMC and Meralco for a rate hike was a close 3-2 vote. The two dissenting ERC commissioners — Alexis Lumbatan and Marko Romeo Fuentes — noted that, under the SMC-Meralco petition, Meralco customers would have to pay an additional P5.2 billion over a six-month recovery period. Under scenario two, where ERC rejected the petition, and SMC withdrew from its PSA, leaving Meralco to secure a one-year emergency supply deal, Meralco consumers would have to pay an additional P12.6 billion for electricity. A similar scenario where the power would be sourced through a competitive selection process would result in an additional burden of P25.8 billion for Meralco customers. A third scenario that has Meralco sourcing power from the electricity spot market will burden consumers with P1.6 billion every single month. The two dissenting commissioners pointed to an internal simulation done by the ERC’s Regulatory Operations Service (ROS) to determine “which available option best serves and protects the consumers.” The ROS in its response, through Alvin Jones Ortega, chief of the tariffs and rates division, confirmed that granting the price adjustment remained the cheapest option,” the dissenting ERC commissioners said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Palawan Rep. Edward Hagedorn seeks to declare the Kalayaan Island Group and Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal, and the three nautical miles around it as a protected area. House Bill No. 6373 was filed on Thursday by Hagedorn, who stressed that the government should prioritize the protection of natural resources in the West Philippine Sea. The bill’s explanatory note cited the significant environmental degradation in the disputed waters that affected the Mischief Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef, Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, and Subi Reef. “The protection of the rich marine resources and environment of the West Philippine Sea is a shared interest and responsibility of all adjoining states around the South China Sea, which should be a guiding policy for all of us in the region,” Hagedorn said in a statement. He added: “We all stand to gain or to lose depending on the outcome of our collective actions while we settle our territorial disputes. Through this bill, we hope for the Philippines to help initiate and spark this regional cooperation.” Other co-authors of HB 6373 were Palawan Reps. Edgardo Salvame and Jose Chavez Alvarez.The measure proposes that the environment secretary also designate strict protection zones in areas with significant biodiversity values or habitats of threatened species. It also prohibits the following acts in the marine protected area: fishing practices that destroy coral reefs, seagrass beds and marine life; dumping and using toxic chemicals, nonbiodegradable materials, and untreated wastes; littering or depositing refuse; using blasting caps or explosives; Undertaking mineral exploration or extraction; introducing exotic species and genetically modified or alien species; constructing and maintaining fences, structures, and enclosures; etc. A Protected Area Management Board and Protected Area Management Office for the Kalayaan Island Group and Scarborough Shoal will be created to lead the protection and preservation of the area. The measure also proposes a P10 million yearly budget to implement measures to protect the marine protected area in the West Philippine Sea.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has issued a certificate of finality over the disqualification case against Albay Gov. Noel Rosal for supposedly violating the Omnibus Election Code when he handed out cash aid during the May 2022 elections. The decision of the Comelec en banc to disqualify Rosal will be made final and executory within five days from the receipt of the resolution, unless the Supreme Court orders a temporary restraining order (TRO) or a preliminary injunction, said poll body’s spokesperson John Rex Laudiangco. He noted that Rosal would have to officially step down from office once a writ of execution is issued by officials from the Department of the Interior and Local Government. “Still, the remedy of a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court is available for the respondent within the period allowed by the Rules on Civil Procedure,” Laudiangco told reporters. Under the rules, Rosal has 15 days to file his appeal. In case Rosal does not seek available legal remedies, the “rule of succession under the Local Government Code” would be implemented, Laudiangco said. This would mean Albay Vice Gov. Edcel “Grex” Lagman Jr. would have to take over from Rosal. The en banc denied on Nov. 18 Rosal’s motion for reconsideration filed in September, which asked to review its ruling on the distribution of cash assistance to tricycle drivers and senior citizens when he was still a mayor of Legazpi City but running for the post of Albay governor. Laudiangco also later clarified to reporters that registration will be open on weekends only from Dec. 17 and only until Jan. 22. There will also be no voter registration on Dec. 24 and 25 and on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Following the dismissal of his petition, Rosal had said that he would file a petition for a TRO before the Supreme Court.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The head of the Senate finance committee on Friday said more than P141 billion had been set aside for next year to settle the unpaid pandemic benefits of health workers, but nearly half of the amount has yet to be funded. Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara said lawmakers allocated almost P25 billion to the Department of Health (DOH) in the proposed P5.268-trillion national budget for 2023, which the Senate approved on Wednesday, to provide benefits for health-care professionals in the battle against COVID-19.  He said an additional P53 billion would be sourced from the P588-billion “unprogrammed appropriations,” or public funds whose use has not yet been specified in detail, leaving P63.27 billion still “unfunded.” “We still lack funds for it,” Angara told the Inquirer. Republic Act No. 11712, or the Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowances for Health Care Workers Act, was passed in April this year. Payments of pandemic benefits called health emergency allowance (HEA) are to start on July 1, but these were made retroactive to July 2021, resulting in arrears for the government as no allocation was made for that in last year’s budget. Angara said P51 billion had been allocated for the pandemic benefits of health workers in 2022—P42 billion from unprogrammed funds and P9 billion from the DOH. He said 805,863 health workers were entitled to receive this benefit. The law provided similar benefits to “outsourced personnel and other personnel” hired by the government to help contain the pandemic, he said. DOH officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire on Friday said no HEA funding source for the second half of this year had been identified. She said that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) told the DOH that “additional revenues of the government” could be tapped. The DOH had requested another P27 billion from the DBM for the HEA for the remainder of the year, Vergeire said last week. Members of the Alliance of Health Workers (AHW) on Thursday staged “a day of protest” against their “unjust” compensation and the unpaid pandemic benefits. They demanded a minimum monthly “living wage” of P33,000 for all health workers.  Angara said the salary demand may be granted “only if the government can pay and sustain it long term.” “Otherwise, it is like a false promise or false hope,” he said. Sen. JV Ejercito, who authored the universal health care law, supported the wage demand “because of inflationary considerations.” He was backed by Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III. According to Sen. Risa Hontiveros, the DOH made a commitment during the Senate budget deliberations that it would implement the mandated Salary Grade 15 granting P35,097 in monthly basic pay for nurses in state-owned health facilities. She said she also asked the DOH to review its remaining “unobligated funds” for 2022 and use that money to pay for the overdue benefit claims. “Our health-care workers should rightfully be compensated while ensuring that wage gaps between and among public and private health-care workers and in national and local settings are addressed,” Hontiveros told the Inquirer. Reconciling 2 versions The senators and members of the House of Representatives comprising the congressional bicameral committee on the proposed budget on Friday began work to reconcile the two versions of the national spending bill. “Although there are disagreeing provisions and about P 215 billion worth of increases in budget items, I think the House and Senate can easily agree,” said House appropriations senior vice chair Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo. This P215 billion is the proposed realigned programmed funds in the Senate’s version of the national budget. The Senate also realigned P152 million in confidential and intelligence funds (CIF). The House’s version passed in September included P77.5 billion in “institutional amendments” that mostly went to funding health, education, transportation and other services.  Angara said Hontiveros hoped that the Senate amendment to realign millions of pesos in CIF would be retained. Compromise In the case of the P150-million confidential funds proposed for the Department of Education (DepEd) headed by Vice President Sara Duterte, Angara initially wanted to move P100 million to the maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOEs) of the Office of the Vice President (OVP). Hontiveros proposed spending that amount for DepEd’s own MOOE, particularly the Healthy Learners Institution Program, and suggested using the remaining P50 million to support its learning program. Angara proposed a compromise: realign P20 million and leave DepEd with a confidential fund of P30 million. The Office of the President has a proposed CIF amounting to P4.5 billion for 2023. Of the OVP’s budget of P2.3 billion, P500 million was allocated for CIF. Angara said lawmakers hoped to reconcile the two versions of the national budget by next week. This will be then ratified by both chambers and submitted to Malacañang before Congress goes on Christmas break on Dec. 17. Speaker Martin Romualdez said the budget was “the most important tool in accomplishing the objectives of the President’s Agenda for Prosperity and his eight-point socioeconomic development plan.” House appropriations panel chair Rep. Elizaldy Co said the national budget would reflect the socioeconomic agenda of President Marcos. ‘Stand firm’ “We envision the final version as a budget that creates jobs, keeps the macroeconomy stable, and helps keep inflation within a manageable range,” he said in remarks at the start of the bicameral meeting. Co said the House contingent to the bicameral conference will “stand firm” on “nonnegotiables” in the national budget, such as ongoing pandemic response and measures to curb inflation. The human rights group Karapatan said the billions of pesos in CIF should be reallocated to projects that lack funding. Cristina Palabay, Karapatan secretary general, said that in particular, the CIF for the OVP and DepEd should be used instead for public health, education, housing, food and cash aid, and other social services. “Many believe that Sara Duterte’s huge CIF will likely be used to surveil teachers and students, and bankroll the massive troll army that drives the Marcos government’s Red-tagging and disinformation campaign to discredit its critics and launder the sordid reputation of this fascist and corruption-ridden regime,” she said. It is “well-known that CIF-bankrolled expenditures are highly vulnerable to graft and corruption,” Palabay said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The officials of the Department of Health (DOH) welcomed the appointment of Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. as acting president and chief executive officer of Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), hoping his management would hasten “reforms” in the state health insurer, which in recent years has been rocked by complaints over alleged corruption, questionable fund disbursements, bogus patient claims and delayed payment to hospitals. Prior to this new position, Ledesma was already a member of the PhilHealth board of directors, according to Malacañang. DOH officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire on Friday said “based on (Ledesma’s) qualifications … somehow he has [those] qualifications and experiences in management and governance.” “We will just be guiding and working together with Mr. Ledesma with this post he’s been given. And there are a lot of excellent officials who can very well support him,” Vergeire said at a press briefing, adding that running PhilHealth requires “technical know-how especially on financing, actuaries and insurance systems.” Vergeire and her team are set to meet with Ledesma and other PhilHealth officials—including his predecessor, Eli Santos—on Monday. Expanded packages “One of the guidance that we will give to Ledesma as president and CEO would be to continue … and have these reforms in PhilHealth expedited,’’ she said. Among these reforms, Vergeire said, are the expansion of outpatient benefit packages to include one for mental health, among others; improvement of the payment scheme for health-care providers; and having a “third-party risk assessment’’ to determine weaknesses in the PhilHealth system. Malacañang announced Ledesma’s appointment as PhilHealth OIC on Thursday afternoon, shortly after he took his oath of office. Following the President’s meeting with representatives of the private health-care sector, the Office of the Press Secretary said Mr. Marcos “tasked PhilHealth to check ‘best practices’ and include digitalization initiatives for improving health insurance operations and offering health benefits.” Rocky exit from PSALM He earlier served as president and CEO of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM) during the Benigno Aquino administration. PSALM is mainly tasked with the orderly sale and privatization of the government’s power assets. Ledesma was appointed to head PSALM in September 2010, but was suspended for 90 days in May 2015 following a principals board meeting. The reason for his suspension was not formally disclosed, but industry sources then pointed to Psalm’s decision to change the mode of procurement for the rehabilitation works in the Agus hydroelectric power power plant in Marawi City. Prior to his suspension, the Governance Commission for GOCCs (government-owned and controlled corporations) recommended the replacement of Ledesma based on a complaint from a group that called itself “Concerned Employees of PSALM.” ‘Patently illegal’ Ledesma questioned his suspension for being “patently illegal” and sought a legal opinion on whether the PSALM board had the authority to suspend him as president and CEO, and to designate an OIC. He eventually resigned in July 2015. In his resignation letter addressed to then President Benigno Aquino III, he spoke of “an orchestrated effort” to have him removed but maintained that the accusations against him were “without basis.” Ledesma had also worked for various companies, such as the Philippine Commercial International Bank, PCI Capital Corp., Bankers Trust Company, Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is eyeing the Port of Davao as one of the alternative logistics hubs in South East Asia. This was discussed by Port of Davao District Collector Erastus Sandino Austria during the visit of Singapore Ambassador to the Philippines Gerard Ho. During the meeting, Austria explained the Port of Davao’s trade activities in its areas of responsibility, border security accomplishments, and its top import and export commodities from and to Singapore. “He (Austria) also talked about his intention to transform the Port as an alternative center for trade in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in line with the National Economic Development Authority Region XI (NEDA XI) proposed plan to update the Davao Gulf Development Plan (DGDP) of 2013,” the BOC statement read. The DGDP was conceptualized by Vice President Sara Duterte, former Davao City mayor and Regional Development Council chair. The 2013 proposal seeks to advance the Davao Region as a “rising global frontier” and outlines how agencies can work together to maximize the country’s economic plan. The Singaporean diplomats visited the largest partner seaport facility in Panabo City, the Davao International Container Terminal Inc. (DICT), where port officials informed them of the DICT’s current and future expansion projects for better Port services for its clients and stakeholders. ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The House leadership is confident that the Senate will agree to the former’s P77-billion institutional amendments to the proposed P5.268-trillion national budget for 2023, saying this would augment funds for education, health, transportation and other critical social services. House Speaker Martin Romualdez had this to say Sunday, Nov. 27, a few days after the start of the Bicameral Conference Committee meeting on the disagreeing provisions of the 2023 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) or national budget. “We really feel that these institutional amendments will redound to the benefit of the people. Hinding-hindi tayo magkakamali kung ang kapakanan ng mamamayan ang ating uunahin (We can never go wrong by prioritizing the welfare of our countrymen),” Romualdez said. “And we are confident that the Senate and the House bicam members will see eye-to-eye on this. Our objectives are the same: to pass a people’s budget that reflects President Marcos Jr.’s eight-point economic agenda that will help the country bounce back from the pandemic,” added Romualdez, who is Leyte’s 1st district representative. House Appropriations Committee chairman and Ako Bikol Party-list Rep. Elizaldy Co echoed the Speaker’s statements, saying the House prioritized the welfare of the people when it included the P77-billion institutional amendments. “Our amendments can speak for themselves. You can see that is indeed pro-people and pro-development as we prioritized health, education and transportation. We are confident that if the Senate and the House approve these amendments, we can recover well from the pandemic in 2023,” said Co, who is part of the House contingent to the bicam on the budget. The first bicam meeting took place Friday at Manila Golf and Country Club in Makati City. The institutional amendments are assistance or “ayuda” programs that will directly benefit the people. This includes P12.5 billion under the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD), which is broken down into: Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations or AICS (P5 billion), upgrade of senior citizens’ pension through the National Commission of Senior Citizens (P5 billion), and Sustainable Livelihood Program (P2.5 billion). Co also cited the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) P5.5 billion for programs addressing the rising cost of fuel like the fuel subsidy program (P2.5 billion), Libreng Sakay (P2 billion) and bike lane construction (P1 billion); and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE’s) P5 billion for the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD) program (P3 billion) and livelihood (P2 billion) are also part of this direct benefit to the people.

Manila Bulletin,"Economist-solon Joey Sarte Salceda used the occasion of the 77th Annual National Convention of the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA) in Cebu City to explain why the proposed Ease of Paying Taxes Bill must be enacted before Jan. 1, 2023. In his speech at the event, Salceda said that he is optimistic that the bill will be enacted into law before the start of 2023, when most of the bill’s important provisions “could be implemented with the best possible timing”. “TRAIN is cutting personal income taxes across the board by around 5 percent by Jan. 1, 2023. So, we hope to couple that with a few other provisions,” the Albay 2nd district congressman said, referring to the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act. Among the provisions Salceda hopes to have implemented by the start of next year is the indexation of the value-added tax (VAT)-exempt sales threshold to the annual consumer price index (CPI). The threshold is currently at P3 million. “The threshold has not been updated for several years already, and no longer responds to the needs of businesses. The threshold for what is considered a ‘small corporation’ in the tax code is P10 million in sales. It doesn’t make sense that the VAT threshold stagnates,” he said. Salceda also hopes to unify documentary requirements for VAT into the sales invoice, as opposed to the current system of requiring official receipts for goods and sales invoices for services. “It will reduce the documentary discrepancies and make electronic invoicing easier. Easier invoicing means faster VAT refunds. That makes our export sector more competitive.” Under the current system, indirect exporters are liable to VAT but are expected to pass on their VAT to direct exporters who, in turn, can recoup their VAT costs through the 90-day VAT refund system. This, Salceda said, was supposed to address VAT leakages, “but could actually harm export competitiveness and actually reduce the volume of trade and downward linkages, and therefore, actually lead to lower tax collections”. The Bicolano also asked the PICPA to help him “craft a better Taxpayer Bill of Rights”, which is part of the measure. “You would know best how to operationalize the Bill of Rights and to identify which processes can be improved. As tax practitioners, your suggestions are most welcome and requested,” he told the estimated 6,000 attendees of the event. Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, also assured PICPA that he will be inviting them to hearings on concerns with the 90-day VAT refund system and the imposition of VAT on indirect exporters. “I will be inviting PICPA to the hearings. There is already a House resolution on the matter, and the House will act on the resolution,” he added.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. extended his well-wishes to Malaysia’s long-time opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim after the latter was appointed as the new Malaysian Prime Minister on Friday, November 25. In a tweet, Marcos said he was looking forward to how his “good friend” will lead Malaysia and its role in Southeast Asia. “I would like to congratulate my good friend Anwar Ibrahim on his election as Prime Minister of Malaysia,” he said. “I look forward to the stability that his leadership will provide Malaysia and the region,” he added. The country’s monarch swore in Anwar at the royal palace hours after it issued a statement announcing the nomination. “After taking into consideration the views of Their Royal Highnesses the Malay Rulers, His Majesty has given consent to appoint Anwar Ibrahim as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia,” the statement read.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Health (DOH) expressed its support to Emmanuel Rufino Ledesma Jr., who was appointed by the Marcos administration as the acting president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). “We welcome the appointment of Emmanuel Rufino Ledesma Jr. as the acting president and CEO of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation,” said DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire on Friday, Nov. 25. Vergeire also defended the decision of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s decision to tap Rufino for PhilHealth. “It is the prerogative of the President who he appoints. Based on the qualifications, tiningnan naman natin yung kanyang (we checked his) credentials, somehow he has the qualifications and experience on management and governance,” she said. “PhilHealth is just like any other agency though you just need to have technical know-how, especially finance scheme, actuary, on insurance system but part of the work will also be managerial because you are going to oversee and guide the entire organization on the delivery of the objectives of your mandate,” she added. Vergeire assured that the DOH and the PhilHealth board will help Ledesma. “We will guide and work together with Mr. Ledesma with this position that he has been given and there are lots of excellent officials in the government who are very well supportive. And of course, the board of PhilHealth is there wherein the chair is SOH (Secretary of Health),” she said. To note, Ledesma was the former president and CEO of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. Tayag In a related development, DOH Undersecretary Dr. Eric Tayag will be overseeing the operations of the state health agency in Northern Luzon areas. Tayag took his oath of office last week, said Vergeire. “He assumed his position already. He was assigned to our Field Implementation Coordination Team and he is in charge of our Northern Luzon area,” she said. Vergeire noted that the Northern Luzon area comprises of Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, and Central Luzon. “He is in charge of overseeing the operations of our hospitals, our treatment and rehab centers, and our regional offices and of course, coordination with LGUs through our regional office there,” she said.

Prior to his appointment as undersecretary, Tayag held the position of Director IV of the DOH’s Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"House leaders have guaranteed the enactment of the proposed P5.268-trillion national budget for 2023 before the end of the current year, possibly even before Christmas. “We have sufficient time, we will finally approve the budget before yearend. It is the most important tool in accomplishing the objectives of the President’s Agenda for Prosperity and his eight-point socio-economic development plan,” House Speaker and Leyte 1st district Rep. Martin Romualdez said in a statement Friday, Nov. 25. Friday was the first day of the Bicameral Conference Committee meeting on the disagreeing provisions of the House of Representatives and Senate’s respective versions of the proposed 2023 national budget, also known as the General Appropriations Bill (GAB). The bicam meeting took place at the Manila Golf and Country Club in Makati City. One of the attendees to the bicam from the House, Marikina City 2nd district Rep. Stella Quimbo, explained why the enactment of the GAB during this particular budget process might come earlier than in previous years. This, despite the P215 billion worth of institutional amendments or realignments in the GAB that the House and the Senate must iron out before the harmonized budget measure is ratified and readied for President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s signature. “Usually nagiging batas ito (GAB) before New Year. Pero this year, dahil maaga nga tayong nag-umpisa ng trabaho, ang aspiration is sana before Christmas (Usually this becomes a law before the New Year. But this year, the aspiration is have it enacted before Christmas since we were able to start work early),” said Quimbo, senior vice chairperson of the House Committee on Appropriations. Bicam meetings from past years would start in the month of December. “Although may mga disagreeing provisions and I believe amounting to P215 billion worth of increases [on] budget items, sa tingin ko naman mabilis na makaka agree ang House at tsaka ang Senado dahil mayroon tayo for the first time, inadopt natin ang medium term fiscal framework (MMFF), na ito ang naglalaman ng eight points socio-economic agenda ng ating Pangulo (Although there are disagreeing provisions and I believe amounting to P215 billion worth of increases [on] budget items, I believe the House and the Senate will quickly come to an agreement because, for the first time, we’ve adopted the [MTFF] which contains the eight-point socio-economic agenda of the President). “So yan ang guiding rules ng House tsaka Senate. In the end, ang maipapasa natin na version ang siyang pinakamagandang magsusuporta dito sa ating agenda (So that will be the guiding rules of the House and the Senate. In the end, the version that we will pass will be the best one to support our agenda),” Quimbo explained. In looking forward to the enactment of the 2023 GAB, Romualdez said: “With this budget, which is the first full-year spending measure proposed by the President, we hope to sustain or even accelerate our economic growth, which should benefit all of our people.” Friday’s bicam meeting, which represents the final phase of the budget process in Congress, ended just before noon. Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto, who like Quimbo was part of the House contingent to the meeting, said, “I am confident that the budget will be more responsive to both opportunities and challenges next year.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The city government of Manila launched the “Orally Fit Manila by 2030” program on Tuesday, Sept. 27, to provide dental services to Manileno children. Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna, together with the Manila Health Department, led the launching at the Jacinto Zamora Elementary School on Tuesday. “Sisiguraduhin po natin na ang atin pong mga bata ay mayroong malulusog na gums, malaya sa tooth decay at sa cavities, at wala pong magiging problema sa kanilang ngipin at bibig (We will make sure that our children have healthy gums, are free from tooth decay and cavities, and there will be no more problems with their teeth and mouths),” said Lacuna.

Also part of the program are free examinations, free cleaning, and free toothpaste for the students of Jacinto Zamora Elementary School. Six youths from the six districts of the city were also given free braces to properly align their teeth. The local chief executive thanked those who helped and sponsored the students. “Kung kayo naman po ay may extra, sigurado po akong may mapapaligaya kayong isang Batang Maynila (If you have extra, you will make a Manileno child happy).”  ",0

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Thursday, September 29, said Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero “Popoy” De Vera III should explain the issue surrounding the alleged “ghost scholars” before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee and not before the media. “The Chair should make his case before the Blue Ribbon, not before the media,” Hontiveros said in a statement. “The complaints of ghost scholars came from reports of students who have been writing to us. At gusto ko linawin na itong partikular na complaint tungkol sa ghost scholars ay dumating sa aking tanggapan pagkatapos ng Zoom meeting na request ni Chair De Vera ay aking pinaunlakan (I just want to clarify that this particular complaint about ghost scholars was received by my office after I agreed to a Zoom meeting that was requested by Chair De Vera),” the senator said. Last August 2022, Hontiveros filed Senate Resolution No. 128, seeking a Senate investigation on the implementation of the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UniFAST), after the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged almost P7-billion worth of “questionable releases” under the CHED’s scholarship agency. But the matter was raised when the Senate Finance Committee tackled CHED’s proposed P30.7-billion budget for 2023 earlier this week. Hontiveros said her office has been swamped by complaints from almost 400 students who claimed that they have not yet received their education subsidy. De Vera has rejected the allegations and have asked Hontiveros to submit to the committee names and documents to check the veracity of the complaints. The CHED chairman said that there have always been complaints hounding the government’s social welfare programs, but the best way to resolve it is to look at the evidence. But Hontiveros said it should be CHED who should look into the identity of the individuals who received the fund, pointing out that the concerned students who expressed their grievances on social media platforms have requested that their identities be withheld for fear of reprisal. “The resolution we filed appears to have opened a can of worms and every day they look away and gaslight our scholars, we get more complaints,” Hontiveros said. This, combined with adverse findings by COA, she said “appears to show a pattern of multiple irregularities regarding UNIFAST.” “Walang humpay ang dating ng mga reklamo. Nakakalungkot dahil ang nararamdaman nila ay wala silang ibang masandalan at mapagakatiwalaan (Complaints continue to pour in. It’s sad that they feel they can’t trust no one). CHED should work on restoring that trust rather than dismissing the reports that my office receives,” the senator pointed out. “Daan daan ang estudyante na ang nagrereklamo kaya para sa akin, panahon na para sa isang pormal na pagdinig, imbes na sa media nagtatanungan ng mga ebidensya. For the sake of our students, kailangan himayin ang lahat ng issue (Hundreds of students are complaining, that’s why for me, it’s time to conduct a formal hearing, instead of asking for evidences through the media. For the sake of our students, we need to scrutinize all the issue),” she said  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Former president Rodrigo Duterte has rallied his party —Partido Demokratiko Pilipino – Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban)—to give their full support to the current president, saying they are not organizing a strong party just to quarrel with him. “I would like to make this thing very very clear. We are not putting up a strong party against the party of the President,” Duterte said in his speech after the election of a new set of PDP-Laban officers during its national assembly on Thursday, Sept. 29. “We are not going to quarrel with him…We will be giving our full support to him,” the tough-talking former leader added. The Duterte led-PDP-Laban faction has elected Palawan 2nd District representative Jose Alvarez as its new president while Senator Robinhood Padilla is the new Executive Vice President.

He also expressed hopes that Marcos would lead the country by prioritizing the interest of Filipinos. “I hope that…I wish the President good luck and I hope he would govern this country in accordance to what is the mandate of the people’s interest,” he said. The former president went on to boost the morale of his party which he tagged as the “dominant party” in the country’s political scene now. “You hang on to this party because it will carry you into victory,” he told the members. He said he will vouch for them in the next elections as he urged them to “organize.” “We will organize. It’s a good number to start a political movement. Sabihin ko sa inyo. Hindi naman bold prediction but it’s just a projectory na kung ganito palagi ang takbo ng gobyerno (I’m telling you. This is not a bold prediction but it’s just a projectory that if the government will continue to be run like this), without criticizing anybody, you will win in the next election.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos has committed to ensure the “efficient and effective” use of foreign institutions’ assistance to the Philippines under his watch. Speaking at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Thursday, Sept. 29, Marcos thanked the regional development bank for its continued support to the country as he vowed to put these assistance to good use. “As President, it is certainly my duty to ensure that the government remains committed in the efficient and effective utilization of this institution’s assistance for the full benefit of all Filipinos,” he said. He also pledged that the government’s relationship with the ADB under his administration will grow stronger. “As President, I will assure that the government’s relationship with the ADB can only grow stronger in the years to come, harnessing mutual cooperation to nurture development here in our country together with our partners around the world and in the region,” he said. Marcos recognized the the ADB for allowing the Philippines to access its quick disbursing budget support facility to aid countries in mitigating the severe economic shocks caused by the pandemic. “It is through the bank assistance that we were able to push forward with projects in areas such as infrastructure, social reform, and community development in government and institutions development, all of which are consistent with this administration’s 8-point socio agenda,” he said. The President also encouraged international counterparts and partners to work together for a better post-pandemic world. “It is time for us to work together to bring about an even better normal. I believe that at the heart of this goal is in the way that we must develop an economy that is green, that is sustainable, truly climate resilient and responsive to people’s immediate needs,” he said. Marcos’ participation in this year’s annual meeting marks the commitment of the Philippines in ensuring the efficient and effective utilization of ADB’s assistance for the full benefit of all Filipinos, especially in coping with the challenges of the post-pandemic world. It was attended by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa, ADB governors and alternate governors. “I am truly excited to see the outcome of this meeting as we set sail towards a better tomorrow that is more resilient, more inclusive, more sensitive to our people’s needs and more aware of climate change and the crisis that it brings with it,” Marcos said. Various issues on economic and social developments within Asia and the Pacific Region are discussed in the forum which also serves as an avenue to “provide guidance on ADB administrative, financial and operational directions.” It is the fourth day of the 55th ADB Annual Meeting where the discussion centers on managing Asia’s energy transition and pathways to sustainable green growth in the time of Covid-19 recovery.

Manila Bulletin,"The Japanese government is preparing for the state visit of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., Vice President Sara Duterte revealed on Thursday, Sept. 29, upon her return from Tokyo to attend the state funeral for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Duterte was the Philippines’ special envoy to Abe’s state funeral in Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, where about 6,000 guests attended last Tuesday, Sept. 27. She met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who talked to her about his country’s current preparations for Marcos’ state visit. Duterte did not reveal the date of the President’s Tokyo state visit, which will mark his third official trip as Chief Executive. “Discussion of the preparations of Japan sa pagbisita ng ating Pangulong Marcos dun sa kanila (about the visit of our President Marcos there), I understand they are working on a state visit for President Marcos in Japan,” she said during an interview on the sidelines of former senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago’s sixth death anniversary at the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City. The President earlier visited neighboring Singapore and Indonesia to mark the country’s openness to receive foreign investments in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Marcos also just arrived from attending the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. Duterte, who arrived on Wednesday, Sept. 28, from Tokyo, shared that she thanked Kishida for Japan’s continuing assistance to the Philippines. “We talked about there, first and foremost, our gratitude to Japan for all their help (to) the Philippines particularly for their support in recent years in the Build Build program of our government,” she said in Filipino. The Vice President was referring to former president Rodrigo Duterte’s flagship infrastructure development program—Build, Build, Build—which Japan had supported.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has floated the idea of pursuing a partnership with France on nuclear energy. Marcos said he had a “very extensive” and “quite productive” bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, where they discussed different issues focusing on energy, defense, and agriculture. “I had a very extensive and quite productive meeting with President Macron of France and of course, we discussed some of the regional issues that are impacting upon the economy and the worries that we have for the future and the partnerships that are developing between even far off places, what we used to regard as far off places like France and the Philippines,” President Marcos said after the meeting held on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit on Nov. 18. Marcos said he engaged Macron to talk about energy because France is a leading proponent of nuclear energy and its experience is quite extensive, “which the Philippines could rely on if it goes ahead with a partnership on nuclear energy.” “I’m very confident that it will be a strong partnership simply because up to 67 percent of their power production is from nuclear energy so they are very, very used to it,” Marcos noted. Defense was also discussed during their meeting, the President said, pointing out the interconnectivity not only in the global economy but even political structures around the world that France would be involving itself in defense issues in the region. “So there are increased involvement in exercises, there are increased presence in the Asia Pacific region and all of that,” he said. He also brought up agriculture to see how the Philippines can get assistance from other countries or entities. “So these are areas that… the three basic areas that considered that partnerships could be explored. He was also kind enough to invite me to visit France when the time comes,” Marcos said as he also reciprocated Macron’s invitation. Before leaving Thailand, Saturday, Nov. 19, the President will have bilateral meetings with leaders of New Zealand, Australia, and Thailand. He will also meet the Filipino community, concluding his four-day working visit here.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has maintained the Philippines’ position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying the war is “unacceptable.” Marcos in an interview with reporters on Saturday, Nov. 19, said that while the country continues to employ a “friend to all, enemy to none” foreign policy, he joins other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies in calls to end the war. “I kept reminding everyone that our national policy, our foreign policy rather, our foreign policy is based on the national interest and peace. And that’s our guide. And I think that people understand this very well. We are maintaining that,” he said. “However the war rather is unacceptable,” he added. He said he also joins the appeal that peace be brought back to Ukraine as he reiterated that “the effect is not solely upon Ukraine or Russia.” This, he said, is something that was even made clearer in the APEC meet here. “There were several speeches that I made all of them included urging that peace be brought back to Ukraine and that the confrontation be brought to diplomatic space. Para wala ng gulo at (To end the war)… Because the effect is not solely upon Ukraine or Russia,” the President said. “I think it’s very clear. It was made even clearer here in APEC, how the effects have been so far-reaching and profound and to the detriment of many economies and the food supply of everyone in the world,” he pointed out. He further said that the fighting must stop and “we have to move on to diplomacy so that we at least, these other aspects of the Ukrainian and Russian economy can be productive again.” Through a declaration, most of the 21 APEC member economies strongly condemned Russia for invading Ukraine.

Manila Bulletin,"We have to be in the same lifeboat. This was what President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. told New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on advancing their goal towards peace in the Asia Pacific region. Marcos raised the need to strengthen efforts to achieve peace, which, he said, is “past, present and future consideration of our initiatives” in the region during his bilateral meeting with Ardern on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on Saturday, Nov. 19. “Because it is a multilateral partnership so that’s what I think. Let’s make that very, very strong, and as long as we look after the region, [the] Asia-Pacific, we look after our interest, I really think we could weather the storm and beyond that. We cannot just set aside the effort to make the economy vibrant again,” Marcos said. The President added: “I think we can do both. But you cannot do anything if there is no peace, and that is just the basic… If that becomes a critical issue in the sense that we are all on high alert for war, everything stops, everything stops. And here we go again.” “We have to be in this lifeboat together and keep at it together – that’s my view,” Marcos further said. Marcos disclosed that New Zealand is keen on collaborating with Filipino farmers in a bid to increase sustainability and productivity in the Asia-Pacific region. Marcos and Jacinda also agreed to strengthen further their partnership in trade which has grown “at a steady pace.” “Our trade, our connection, has been growing at a steady pace. And we want perhaps after things open up even more and come back to what we all considered to be normal, it would increase. The population of the Philippines is growing, and the continuing need to trade,” Marcos told Ardern. “I think that once again the best solution is just have strong partnerships. You can have slightly different positions within that – but you are members of a political aggrupation and economic aggrupation, there’s strength in numbers,” Marcos stressed. Both leaders also expressed readiness to empower Filipino migrant workers and enhance the capacity to respond to their needs. “Most people don’t find great opportunity. But that’s what happened, and we go where the work is. The diaspora has really become a significant part of our culture,” Marcos said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The creation of a Select Oversight Committee on Confidential and Intelligence Expenses will help ensure that agencies who are given confidential and intelligence funds (CIFs) would be able to use this specific appropriation for the purpose it was intended for, Senate Committee on Finance chief Sen. Sonny Angara said on Sunday, November 20. Angara pointed this out as he vouched that the P500-million and P150-million CIFs that the Senate approved for the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education (DepEd)—both of which are headed by Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio—would be utilized properly and wisely. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III and fellow minority Senator Risa Hontiveros have both vowed to push for the realignment of the funds under the Vice President during the period of amendments on the proposed P5.268-trillion national budget for 2023 scheduled this week. “Meron talagang paraan para talagang bantayan yan. At iyan ay tinutukan din ng ating Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri nung mag-file po siya ng Resolusyon na buhayin po itong Select Oversight Committee on Confidential and Intelligence Expenses (There is really a mechanism on how to really look after that. And that was also pointed out by our Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri when he filed a resolution to revive the Select Oversight Committee on Confidential and Intelligence Expenses),” Angara said in a Radio DZBB interview. Last week, the Senate President filed the resolution to form an oversight panel that will investigate the utilization of CIFs allocated under the proposed 2023 national budget after several former senators pushed for its activation. The Senate finance panel head noted it was an advice of the former Senate president Vicente “Tito” Sotto III and former Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, who also once chaired the committee. “Ipinaalala nila na merong ganyang komite dati na hindi lang basta-basta pinapalusot lahat ng gastos ng mga ahensya sa confidential at intelligence expenses. (They reminded that there used to be a similar committee that did not just slip all the expenses of the agencies into confidential and intelligence expenses),” Angara pointed out. “At yan, kailangan ilabas nila kung talagang nararapat sa national security para sa darating na mga taon, ma-evaluate o mabantayan din yan ng kongreso pagdating dito sa budget (And that, they need to release if it is really appropriate for national security for the coming years, Congress can also evaluate or monitor that when it comes to the budget),” he said. Angara, nevertheless, said there is a possibility that the CIFs under the DepEd and the OVP could be slashed and/or channeled to other agencies. But on a personal note, the senator said he hopes that the CIFs allocated for the vice president would be maintained to enable Duterte-Carpio’s office to function well, as what President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. would want to happen. Pag-aaralan po namin yan, pero sa akin nga, parang hindi maganda na halal po ng tao yan at binigyan po ng Pangulo sa ilalim ng kanyang kauna-unahang budget. Ipinagkatiwala kay VP Sara Duterte po yan, tapos tatanggalan po natin ng pondo — parang hindi yata (We will study that, but to me, it doesn’t seem good that people chose it and the President gave it to her under his first budget. That was entrusted to VP Sara Duterte, then we will remove the funds — I don’t think so),” “Kung ako po ang tatanungin nang personal, huwag naman po natin ilabas yun sa kanyang opisina, sapagkat yun ay gusto ng taumbayan, gusto ng Pangulo na magtagumpay po ang ating Bise Presidente dahil siya ay isang mahalagang bahagi ng kanyang administrasyon. Kaya nga, ipinagkatiwala sa kanya yung one of the biggest department sa ating pamahalaan at dyan nakasalalay po yung kinabukasan ng ating mga kabataan (If you ask me personally, let’s not bring it out fro her office, because that’s what the people want. The President wants that our Vice President succeed because she is an important part of his administration. That’s why, she was entrusted with one of the biggest departments in our government and the future of our youth depends on that),” Angara stressed. “Yun ang personal na pasya ko lang po. Pero puwedeng mag-iba po yan dahil alam nyo naman ang Senado ay isang collegial body. At kung merong mga contentious issues or mga kontrobersyal, puwedeng maiba yan dahil pagbobotohan yan at kung minsan may kompromiso. Ganun talaga ang proseso sa isang collegial body. Ibig sabihin, hindi iisang tao ang nagdedesisyon kundi yung sinasabing collegial ay yung kolektiba ang nagpapasya (That’s just my personal decision. But that can change because you know the Senate is a collegial body. And if there are contentious issues or controversial ones, it can be different because it will be voted upon by the members and sometimes there will be a compromise. That is exactly the process in a collegial body. That means, it is not a single person who makes the decision, but what is said to be collegial is the collective decision),” he explained. Angara earlier said the Senate is aiming to approve the 2023 national budget by end of November so the President can sign the General Appropriations Bill (GAB) before Christmas. President Marcos has certified the 2023 budget bill as urgent, citing the need for continuous government operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to support programs for full economic recovery.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Sonny Angara is now seeking the passage of a bill that would establish living facilities for public school teachers to help them cope with the worsening traffic congestion and the difficulty in getting public transportation. Angara, in filing Senate Bill No. 1169, or the proposed “Teachers’ Home in School Act”, said it is high-time the government solves the problem of public school teachers whenever they commute or are deployed in schools that are part of the Department of Education’s (DepEd) last mile schools program. “In February 2019, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) reported the chronically overworked state of public school teachers in the country as they are not only teaching the students but they are also given multitude of nonteaching tasks,” Angara said in the explanatory note of the bill. “The worsening traffic congestion also contributes to the burden of the teachers as majority of them rely on public transportation to get to school,” he further said. Citing ThoughtCo, a premier reference site on education content based in New York, Angara said a teacher who loses as little as five minutes of instructional minutes per day due to inefficiencies wastes 15 hours of opportunity over the course of a 180-day school year. “In order to provide all the learning opportunities to all Filipino learners and provide remedial interventions to students who are lagging behind while ensuring the safety and promoting the rights of our public school teachers, this bill mandates the DepEd and the Department of Public and Works Highways (DPWH) to construct living facilities for public school teachers who spend long hours of commuting every day just to report to work or who are deployed in the last mile schools away from their families. “The living facilities shall be constructed within the public schools or at the nearest possible location of the public schools,” Angara stressed. The senator also noted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, majority of Filipino learners have struggled to have access to quality education due to so many issues and concerns, like lack of school buildings and classrooms, undersupported, overworked and underpaid teachers, large class sizes and inadequate budget for the national education system. While the DepEd has exerted numerous efforts and programs to address these challenges, he pointed out the agency has failed to exert the same amount of attention in solving the plight of public school teachers. “Given the noble objectives of this measure, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go on Monday, September 26 renewed his push for the passage of the proposed Philippine Building Act of 2022, which aims to set higher standards and benchmarks in the construction of buildings to ensure the structural stability and integrity of edifices and make it disaster-resilient. The measure, Senate Bill No. 1181, seeks to provide more effective regulation of planning, design, construction, occupancy and maintenance of all public and private buildings and structures, and promotes building resilience against natural and man-made disasters. The bill also primarily seeks to amend the National Building Code of the Philippines to ensure that all buildings and structures are built according to the principle of “building back better.” Go noted that it has been decades since the country’s National Building Code was enacted into law and it is high-time to update some of its provisions in line with the new and modern science and technology. “Panahon na po upang ating pag-aralan ang pag-update sa National Building Code na ito (It’s time to study updating the National Building Code),” Go said in a statement. “’Building back better’ requires that in the reconstruction of damaged structures, due consideration shall be given to the possibility of the disaster repeating itself,” he further said. “Ire-require din natin na ma-integrate ang disaster resilience measures sa paggawa ng rules and regulations, at sa reference standards para sa pagplano, pag-design, at pag-reconstruct ng mga bagong buildings and structures na itatayo (We will also require that disaster resilience measures are integrated when making the rules and regulations and new reference standards in the planning, design and construction of new buildings and structures),” explained Go. Go said the same requirement should be applied in the establishment of permanent evacuation centers in every city, province and municipality nationwide, which is under proposed Senate Bill No. 193. Go has filed Senate Bill No. 193 or the proposed Mandatory Evacuation Center Act of 2022, which aims to ensure that disaster-affected families can take refuge in evacuation centers that are safe, dedicated and equipped with basic necessities. In accordance with the specifications of the National Building Code, Go said these evacuation centers shall be constructed and designed to withstand super typhoons or wind speeds of at least 300 kilometers per hour and seismic activity of at least 8.0 magnitude. “More or less 20 typhoons ang pumapasok sa ating bansa bawat taon. Kaya naman napaka importante po ng (enter the country every year.

The Manila Times,"Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. is looking forward to having a ""strong partnership"" with France on nuclear energy as the Philippines moves closer to adopting this power source to improve its long-term energy security. Marcos held a bilateral meeting with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, where they discussed energy, agriculture and defense. The President said he engaged Macron to talk about energy because France is a leading proponent of nuclear energy and its experience is quite extensive, which the Philippines could rely on if it goes ahead with a partnership. ""I'm very confident that it will be a strong partnership simply because they have up to 67 percent of their power production from nuclear energy, so they are very, very used to it,"" Marcos said after his meeting with Macron. Marcos previously expressed his desire to adopt nuclear energy as part of the country's power mix and the need to build new plants. In his State of the Nation Address in July, the President said that should the country opt to use nuclear energy under his term, the government will use the guidelines adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). ""I believe that it is time also to reexamine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the Philippines. We will comply, of course, with the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima,"" Marcos told lawmakers. He admitted that while innovations would allow power plants to utilize nuclear energy on a smaller scale, funding could be an issue. ""In the area of nuclear power, there have been new technologies developed that [allow] smaller scale, modular, nuclear plants and other derivations thereof. Once again, PPPs (public-private partnerships) will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited,"" he added. Marcos' father, former president Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., was one of the proponents of nuclear energy. The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the country's first and only nuclear power plant, was unused for fear of accidents. Agri, defense cooperation Meanwhile, Marcos said he also brought up agriculture to see how the Philippines can get assistance from other countries or entities. ""I had a very extensive and quite productive meeting with President Macron of France and of course, we discussed some of the regional issues that are impacting upon the economy and the worries that we have for the future and the partnerships that are developing between even far off places, what we used to regard as far off places like France and the Philippines,"" he said. Defense was also discussed, the President said, pointing to interconnectivity not only in the global economy but even political structures around the world where France would be involving itself in. ""So there is increased involvement in exercises, there is increased presence in the Asia Pacific region and all of that,"" Marcos said. ""So, these are areas that ... the three basic areas where partnerships could be explored. He was also kind enough to invite me to visit France when the time comes,"" he added.Last month, French Ambassador to the Philippines Michèle Boccoz said that Marcos is likely to visit France, but cited no definite date as to when it will happen. On September 16, the two leaders for the first time talked to each other by phone, where they agreed to deepen their countries' relations in terms of low-carbon energy, food security, defense and human exchanges. Marcos and Macron also met on September 21 at the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has started rescuing Indigenous peoples (IPs) who ended up begging in Metro Manila streets. DSWD Secretary Erwin Tulfo said the rescue operations for Aetas and Badjaos started on Nov. 18, 2022. In a statement issued on Sunday, Tulfo said that 100 Badjaos from Mindanao were plucked off the streets. He said these IPs will be sent back to their provinces and the government will provide them with livelihood. ""Dati rati kasi bibigyan lang sila ng pagkain, bibilhan ng tiket ng barko at saka pauwiin (The government used to give them food and buy them tickets to return home). You do not solve their problem. They do not have food in their hometowns because they have no livelihood, thus they keep coming back to beg on the streets,"" the DSWD chief said. Each rescued IP family will be given P10,000 which they can use to begin a small business when they get back home. Food packs, as well as hygiene kits, will also be given to the families. Tulfo gave assurances that the government will help members of Indigenous tribes not only during the Christmas season but throughout the year so that they will not keep going back to cities to beg. The department said it will also rescue street children in coordination with local government units. DSWD Undersecretary Denise Bragas said that children who have been plucked from the streets three times will no longer be returned to their parents.

The Manila Times,"AN official of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources said that the DENR-Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) has started its investigation on the controversial quarrying inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP). In a radio interview, DENR Undersecretary for Policy Planning and International Affairs Jonas Leones said based on the initial report of the MGB Region 4A (Calabarzon), at least 10,000 cubic meters of soil were extracted from the quarrying site, with at least 6,000 cubic meters of soil missing. ""Based on the initial investigation conducted by members of the MGB Region 4A, they saw a tunnel and heavy equipment no longer operating. Based on the estimate of our personnel from the MGB, approximately, at least 10,000 cubic meters [of soil] were extracted but the stockpile was only 4,000 cubic meters. We want to know where the 6,000 cubic meters are,"" Leones said. Leones added that based on the initial assessment of the DENR-MGB, there was an ongoing quarrying activity inside the NBP. ""The MGB personnel said it seems like a quarry, although we need to investigate further,"" Leones added. Leones said the DENR is having difficulty getting information from the people inside the NBP. ""People we interviewed inside the NBP provided limited information. It seems they are withholding vital facts,"" Leones added. Leones said that the members of the DENR-MGB will ask the assistance of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other intelligence agencies to be able to probe properly. ""Our personnel are also concerned about their safety so we will seek the assistance of the PNP, together with other intel agencies to get to the bottom of the quarrying operation inside the NBP,"" he added. According to Leones, the DENR also secured a sample of the soil extracted from the quarrying site to analyze its quality. ""We will analyze the soil if it has value to determine if the objective is to sell the ore in case it has value,"" Leones said. Leones vowed that the DENR will issue its findings in the coming weeks. ""We will still have an in-depth visit or ocular inspection and then probably, we can interview people to determine the purpose of the tunnel. In the next few days or weeks, we could determine the bottom of this excavation inside the Bilibid Prison,"" he said.

The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. is eyeing to build at least one million units of low-cost housing every year as part of his administration's effort to address the backlog in the country. At the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summits in Cambodia on Thursday, Marcos admitted that the Philippines is currently facing a housing shortfall of about six million units. ""And that is why we have taken on a very aggressive housing program,"" Marcos said in a roundtable meeting with Cambodian business leaders. ""So we are aiming for one million homes, one million low-cost and socialized homes a year. It is an ambitious number but we will try very, very hard,"" he added. The President noted that the problems the lack of housing brings ""extend into the social side."" ""It becomes a problem for the rest of society when people do not have homes,"" Marcos said. In building houses, the President likewise explained that ""you cannot just build a house, you have to build a community"". ""Otherwise, it is not practical for people to live there. So there has to be schools nearby, work cannot be farther, commute cannot be more than one hour, there has to be a marketplace, all of this. The transportation is easy to get to,"" he added.

The Manila Times,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has given the Department of Energy (DoE) the green light to explore the potential of offshore wind (OSW) as a new source of clean and sustainable energy. The Chief Executive approved the proposal following his meeting with officials of the DoE and other concerned agencies prior to his departure to Cambodia last Wednesday, provided that the energy department will handle the regulatory functions to streamline coordination and simplify the approval process. He likewise ordered the creation of an Offshore Wind Development and Investment Council, composed of relevant government agencies that will serve as a one-stop shop for OSW developers. ""It should be the Department of Energy who should be talking with the OSW developers, in consultation with the council, of course. It has to be led by the DoE,"" Marcos said. The President in his inaugural State of the Nation Address last July said his government will prioritize clean energy and, at the same time, tap natural gas and nuclear power to meet the Philippines' energy demands. Based on the World Bank's OSW Roadmap, the Philippines has the capacity to deploy 40 gigawatts of OSW electricity by 2050. Relatedly, Marcos also reiterated the need for the government to work aggressively in addressing the country's short-term and long-term energy requirements, citing the long time it takes to build a new power plant as an example. He added that there must be a plan to avert a power shortage, especially during the dry season. ""If we don't start now, then it will just get delayed. But so far, if we can clear up some issues with the NGCP (National Grid Corp. of the Philippines), they're all right for supply in the next few months until the summer,"" he said.

The Manila Times,"FORMER president Rodrigo Duterte has insisted that the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), are terrorist organizations no matter what any court says. He was referring to a recent decision of Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 19 Presiding Judge Marlo Apalisok Magdoza-Malagar that junked the Department of Justice's (DoJ) 2018 proscription petition to declare the CPP-NPA as terrorist groups. ""There is no need for anybody to declare them terrorists. They've long been terrorists. They've long been our enemies,"" the 77-year-old ex-leader asserted during the 40th anniversary celebration of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Laban ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) during a general assembly in Pasay City on Thursday, September 29. ""You don't need a license or a new mandate to fight them. It's a continuing [mandate to fight the] CPP,"" he said. It was during Duterte's term that the government permanently shut down peace negotiations over the Philippine Left's perceived insincerity to reach an agreement. Instead, Duterte ordered intensified localized peace efforts spearheaded by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac). The task force's former spokesman, Lorraine Badoy, has gained support from the anti-insurgency group that she used to work with under the Duterte administration, lauding her ""active position"" when she chided Magdoza-Malagar in a now-deleted social media post. ""We commend her active position as a champion for NTF-Elcac in her own private capacity,"" the task force said in a statement on Friday. ""[The NTF-Elcac] wouldn't have been able to accomplish its many remarkable gains if not for the Filipino people, both from the government and private sector, who have courageously and tirelessly championed the advocacy of this coalition,"" it added. Badoy had called out Magdoza-Malagar for her decision to dismiss the proscription case seeking to declare the CPP and the NPA as terrorist organizations. The Supreme Court on Wednesday said inciting violence and harm against judges and their families can be considered as contempt against the High Tribunal. It also said the court will be dealing with the matter ""accordingly."" ""The court sternly warns those who continue to incite violence through social media and other means which endanger the lives of judges and their families, and this shall likewise be considered a contempt of this court, and will be dealt with accordingly,"" the Supreme Court added. Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo took notice of Badoy's statement and vowed to protect the judges and judiciary workers. Nueva Vizcaya Rep. Luisa Lloren Cuaresma had said the Philippine National Police (PNP) had informed them that they will investigate Badoy over her social media post. Cuaresma, who sponsored the budget proposal of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), made the remark after Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel pointed to the post of Badoy. The PNP is under the DILG. Badoy has denied that she made any threats against Magdoza-Malagar. I did not threaten anybody. Lalo na 'yung judge. Walang threats 'yan [Especially the judge. There were no threats],・ she said in a radio interview.  ",0

""After our aerial inspection today, we found some areas that are still inundated with water. Nueva Ecija and Aurora are without power. We are sending gensets (generator sets) now,"" Marcos said. He said that generally, ""the damage to public and private infrastructure is manageable. Government services are almost at full function. Main thoroughfares are passable, communication is up and running.""  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE government should study whether talk of amending or discarding the 1987 Constitution undermine efforts to draw foreign investments to the Philippines. Many people, including prospective investors, have criticized the country for changing or even reversing policies, often every six years when a new government starts its term. Policymakers might want to look at countries with more economic restrictions than the Philippines, like China and Vietnam, and how they manage to lure more foreign direct investments than most markets in the region. Arguably, China and Vietnam are fraught with challenges that are more difficult than what investors encounter in the Philippines. Because of their communist systems, for instance, China and Vietnam do not allow private ownership of property. There are also restrictions on the repatriation of income, and for many foreigners, there is a daunting language barrier. At least for China, there are also concerns about the security of intellectual property. Still, investors flock to those countries. Of course, there are many reasons why, not least of which is their large and increasingly affluent consumer base. But more to the point, investors going there can be fairly certain that the rules of doing business are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. That certainty may be attributed to the stability of their respective governments. In China, the communist party has been in power since 1949. For its part, Vietnam has been ruled by the same party since the north and south were consolidated by the communists in 1975. Of course, both countries later opened up their economies and essentially embraced capitalist reforms, without losing the identity of their political systems. A similar stability may be seen in Singapore and perhaps until recently, Malaysia. Like China and Vietnam, one party has dominated politics in each of these two Southeast Asian nations. But unlike the earlier examples, Singapore and Malaysia are actually investor-friendly. That stability factor deserves more study, as it could explain why foreign investors have been flocking to China, Singapore, Malaysia and more recently, Vietnam. The Philippines should be doing comparatively better than them in attracting foreign investments. Here, there is no communication barrier to those who speak English, the language of international business. Filipino culture is familiar to Westerners and others from countries where investments typically originate. Of course, there are hurdles in the Philippines. But note that the investment barriers existing here are also in Vietnam and China, at least in its earlier stages of development. Certainly, those two countries cannot match the ease of doing business in Singapore and Malaysia. So, a common factor among them seems to be the continuity of laws and other policies. Not unusual As mentioned earlier about the Philippines, a typical complaint is the constant shifting in rules and policies that create an unstable and hard to predict business environment. This is what some people mean when they claim that there is no sanctity of contracts in the Philippines. On a positive note, people are more hopeful about the new Marcos government because it pledged to continue many of the policies of the previous Duterte administration. As expected, though, the Senate has started public hearings on amending the Constitution, perhaps even changing the entire system of government. And recently, there was a suggestion being floated to scrap the 1987 Constitution and bring back the 1935 Constitution. Whether or not these proposed changes are beneficial, is not the point of this editorial. Rather, talk of change is like background noise to efforts to lure more investments into the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. just wrapped up a visit to the United States where he talked to major American conglomerates and business groups about opportunities here. Earlier, he visited Indonesia and Singapore where he secured investment and trade pledges worth billions. One might wonder whether prospective investors might be thinking about how their businesses might be affected by the proposed changes, and whether future governments will continue to honor the commitments made today. Economic managers and policymakers need to ponder on that possibility. Addressing it could unlock the full potential of the Philippines.  ",0
The Manila Times,"Looking to ""reintroduce the Philippines"" to the world, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has plans for his nation on the international stage and at home — if, that is, the twin specters of pandemic and climate change can be overcome or at least managed. And if he can surmount the legacies of two people: his predecessor and his father. He also wants to strengthen ties with both the United States and China — a delicate balancing act for the Southeast Asian nation — and, like many of his fellow leaders at the United Nations this week, called on the countries that have caused global warming to help less wealthy nations counteract its effects. In a separate interview with former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd here, Marcos also laid out his economic agenda where he hoped there would be ""not one more hungry Filipino."" Marcos, swept into office in the May 2022 Philippine elections, is drawing distinctions both subtle and obvious between himself and his voluble predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who alienated many international partners with his violent approach to fighting drug trafficking and the coarse rhetoric he used to galvanize supporters. Asked if Duterte went too far with his lethal drug crackdown, Marcos redirected the criticism toward those who carried out the plan. ""His people went too far sometimes,"" Marcos told The Associated Press on Friday. ""We have seen many cases where policemen, other operatives, some were just shady characters that we didn't quite know where they came from and who they were working for. But now we've gone after them."" Marcos said that his administration's war on drugs will shift its focus to target the big networks involved in such illegal activity in the country and not on ""the kid who makes P100 a week selling weed."" Marcos said that he ordered the Philippine National Police to ""go after people who — if we get them, if we neutralize them, or put them in jail, we put them away, whatever it is — will make an actual difference so that the supply of drugs, the system of distribution, the system of importation of drugs because much of it really does come from abroad."" ""That will actually make a difference; it will put a stop to it. And that's what we are working on right now,"" the President added. Citing that the ""argument or rather the discussion about human rights in the Philippines in the past few years has really derived from the anti-drug war that President Duterte undertook"", Marcos said what can be done is ""to examine and learn lessons from the experience from the past administration."" He said that ""enforcement, which has been the part of the drug war that has been most vigorously pursued by President Duterte, only gets you so far."" Marcos said that instead of simply enforcement, the ""focus"" would be on ""prevention, education and cure."" ""To be more sensitive and more sympathetic to those who actually have gotten caught up in this lifestyle,"" he added. 'Not one more hungry Filipino' In the same interview with Rudd at the Asia Society here, Marcos said what he hoped to achieve with his economic agenda was simple: ""Not one more hungry Filipino."" ""It's a very simple aim. It's a very simple goal,"" said Marcos, acknowledging that ""it is not necessarily a simple problem to solve, and it requires a great deal of effort and thinking on the part of the public sector."" Marcos sits concurrently as the Philippines' Agriculture secretary. The President noted the importance of their partnership with the private sector to reach the administration's goals. So far, the country is addressing the supposed shortage of sugar and rising prices of basic commodities. But Marcos said improving agricultural productivity and streamlining bureaucracy will ensure a more efficient government service, adding that this will be among his administration's strategies to ensure economic transformation. In the same event, Marcos also touted the country's macroeconomic fundamentals and enabling policies as among the main reasons that make the Philippines a leading investment destination. He said the Philippine economy expanded by 5.7 percent last year and 7.8 percent in the first half of this year. Marcos also cited enabling policies and investor-friendly laws that seek to ""leverage game-changing reforms."" He also took note of the country's human capital and boasted of a ""young, educated, hardworking and English-speaking workforce that is globally competitive."" Family legacy Marcos, 65, sat for a wide-ranging interview in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly's annual leaders' meeting. Three months into his administration, he seemed energetic and enthusiastic — and eager to project his vision for the nation beyond its borders. On Thursday, he met with US President Joe Biden in a bid to strengthen the sometimes complicated ties that have ebbed and flowed between the two nations since the Philippines spent four decades as an American colony in the early 20th century. ""There have been bits and pieces where they were not perhaps ideal,"" Marcos told the Associated Press. ""But in the end, that overall trajectory has been to strengthen and strengthen and strengthen our relationship."" In addition to Duterte, Marcos also must draw distinctions between himself and the most iconic figure in the Philippines' public sphere: his late father, whose name he shares. Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., hero to some and plundering dictator to others, ruled from the 1960s to the 1980s, including a tumultuous period of martial law and repression. He made the family reputation an indelible part of Filipino history. Addressing the family legacy directly is something the son has been loath to do, at least explicitly, though he vehemently rejects use of the term ""dictator"" to describe his father's rule. To him, the political baggage of his parents is a remnant of the past. ""I did not indulge in any of that political back-and-forth concerning the Marcos family,"" he said. ""All I spoke about was, 'What are we going to do to get into a better place?' And people responded."" Engaging, he said, would have simply been a retread — and an unnecessary one. ""It doesn't help. It doesn't change anything,"" he said. ""So what's the point?"" The elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of political opponents and activists and ruled by decree. Thousands of Filipinos disappeared under his rule; some have never been accounted for. No to ICC When it comes to his predecessor, Marcos treads a nuanced political line as well. Distinguishing himself from Duterte's in-your-face rule can benefit him at home and internationally, but Duterte's popularity helped catapult him into office, and the former president's daughter Sara is Marcos' vice president. The extrajudicial killings associated with Duterte's years-long crackdown provoked calls that his administration should be investigated from the outside, and he vowed not to rejoin the International Criminal Court — a precept that Marcos agrees with. After all, Marcos asked, why should a country with a functioning legal system be judged from elsewhere? ""We have a judiciary. It's not perfect,"" he said. ""I do not understand why we need an outside adjudicator to tell us how to investigate, who to investigate, how to go about it."" Marcos cast the coronavirus pandemic as many other leaders have — as a balancing act between keeping people safe and making sure life can push forward. ""We took a very extreme position in the Philippines, and we eventually had the longest lockdown in any country in the world,"" he said. ""That was the choice of the previous government. And now, we are now coming out of it."" In recent days, he has both removed a national mandate to wear masks outdoors and extended a ""state of calamity"" — something he said he didn't necessarily want to do, but keeping the declaration in place allows more people to continue getting help. ""It's not very encouraging when people look at your country and they see, 'Well, it's under a state of calamity.' That's not good for tourists. It's not good for visitors. It's not good for business,"" Marcos said. Encouraging ties with China, particularly given Beijing's aggressive maritime policies, might be a daunting prospect for a nation so closely and historically aligned with the United States. But, Marcos says, it's possible — and necessary. ""It is a very fine line that we have to tread in the Philippines,"" the president said. ""We do not subscribe to the old Cold War 'spheres of influence.'... So it's really guided by national interest, number one. And second, the maintenance of peace."" Peace comes in many flavors. Last week, Marcos traveled to the southern part of the nation — a predominantly Muslim area of a predominantly Catholic country — to express support for a multiyear effort to help a onetime rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, give up their guns and govern their autonomous region effectively. While Moro has come into the government fold, smaller militant groups including the violent Abu Sayyaf have continued to fight the government and wage sporadic attacks, especially in impoverished rural regions with weak law enforcement. Marcos dismissed Abu Sayyaf as a group that no longer has a cause other than ""banditry."" ""I don't believe they are a movement anymore. They are not fighting for anything,"" Marcos said. ""They are just criminals."" Marcos did not specify precisely why the Philippines needed to be reintroduced, though the country's image took a hit from 2016 to 2022 under the Duterte administration. ""The purpose, really, that I have brought to this visit here in New York... has been to try to reintroduce the Philippines to our American friends, both in the private sector and in the public sector,"" he said. And after the pandemic truly ends, he said, the nation needs to find a fruitful path and follow it. ""We have to position ourselves. We have to be clever about forecasting, being a bit prescient,"" he said. ""We do not want to return to whatever it is we were doing pre-pandemic,"" Marcos said. ""We want to be able to be involved and be a vital part of the new global economy, of the new global political situation.""  ",0
The Manila Times,"MORE than 130,000 bamboo culms and native tree seedlings of different species were planted in a simultaneous bamboo and tree planting activity nationwide on the 65th birthday of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. last September 13, according to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Marcos led the kickoff ceremonies in an old sanitary landfill being rehabilitated by the DENR in Barangay Pintong Bocaue in San Mateo, Rizal, which is within the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape. The old sanitary landfill was closed in November 1989. Planted at the site were some 1,613 seedlings including various species of bamboo and fruit-bearing trees. Tree planting activities were simultaneously held in 111 sites in the country covering an aggregate area of 681.5 hectares planted mostly with bamboo culms and indigenous timber tree seedlings such as agoho, kalumpit, yakal, molave, narra, bignai and banaba. The event also coincided with the celebration of Philippine Bamboo Month pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 1401, Series of 2022. Marcos has directed the Environment department to boost the country's resilience to natural disasters by expanding forest cover and accelerating efforts toward forest protection. Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said the nationwide tree planting symbolized the administration's commitment to address climate change, mitigate its effects, and alleviate the risk of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

The Manila Times,"FORMER president Rodrigo Duterte ended his term with a net satisfaction rating of +81 or ""excellent,"" with 88 percent of the respondents satisfied with his performance as president, results of a Social Weather Station survey indicated. SWS said that the non-commissioned survey used face-to-face interviews of 1,500 adults ages 18 years old and above with a sampling error of plus-minus 2.5 percent for national percentages, plus-minus 5.7 percent for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon and Mindanao, and plus-minus 4 percent in the Visayas. The poll taken from June 26 to 29 or a day before Duterte's six-year term ended also showed that his gross satisfaction rating rose 10 points from the 78 percent in April, while the number of dissatisfied fell from 13 percent to 7 percent. The number of undecided fell by four points from 9 percent to 5 percent. Overall, his net satisfaction rating is 16 percent higher than the very good +65 percent reported in the last survey result and surpassed the +79 net satisfaction in November 2020. His end-term net satisfaction rating is the highest among post-EDSA Revolution presidents, eclipsing that of Presidents Benigno Aquino 3rd (+28), Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (-17), Fidel Ramos (+19) and Corazon Aquino (+7). President Joseph Estrada's final net satisfaction rating before he was ousted in January 2001 was +9. Broken down by area, Duterte's net satisfaction rating was ""excellent"" in all areas in the country, with Metro Manila reporting a 22-point increase from +63 to +85, while in Balance Luzon, it went up from +60 to +75. In the Visayas, his net satisfaction rating also increased from +55 to +83, while in Mindanao, his net satisfaction rose from +83 to +90. SWS noted that his net satisfaction in Metro Manila and Balance Luzon surpassed all the survey records he set in November 2020, while the Visayas rating was a record since December 2019. He also was marked ""excellent"" in urban and rural areas, with a plus 20 point increase in urban areas from +65 to +84, and a plus 12 point increase from +65 to +77. Duterte's approval rating also increased to excellent among both men and women, all age groups and all educational groups. Among those families who said that they did not experience hunger in the past three months, his satisfaction rating was at +83, as compared to those who experienced hunger in general, where his satisfaction rating was at +70. His net satisfaction rating was also at +74 in those who said that they experienced moderate hunger, or those who experienced hunger ""Only once"" or ""a few times"" in the past three months, while his satisfaction rating among those who said that they experienced severe hunger, or experiencing hunger ""often or always"" in the past three months, was at +56 percent. The pollster has its own terminology for net satisfaction ratings, with +70 and above as ""excellent""; +50 to +69 as ""very good""; +30 to +49 as ""good""; +10 to +29 as ""moderate""; +9 to -9 as ""neutral""; -10 to -29 as ""poor""; -30 to -49 as ""bad""; -50 to -69 as ""very bad""; and -70 and below as ""execrable.""

The Manila Times,"SEN. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go expressed his support to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) during a public hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Games and Amusement on Wednesday. In a manifestation, Go commended Pagcor for its commitment to nation-building, especially its vital contribution to the government's Covid-19 response efforts. ""It was one of the government agencies recognized by former president Rodrigo Duterte for helping ease the plight of millions of Filipinos who were gravely affected by the health crisis brought about by the pandemic,"" noted Go who serves as vice chairman of the committee. In 2020 and 2021, Pagcor remitted P44.53 billion to the government through its mandated contributions and other corporate social responsibility programs. He added that Pagcor worked hard to meet its revenue targets, which gave a positive impact on the resources for the government's social services program. He also expressed gratitude to the PCSO for supporting the Malasakit Centers program. Go, who is the main proponent of the Malasakit Centers program, principally authored and sponsored the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019. The centers are one-stop shops for all government medical assistance programs, bringing together the Department of Health, Department of Social Welfare and Development, PCSO and PhilHealth under one roof, making it convenient for particularly poor Filipinos to access medical care. During the hearing, Go also urged the Pagcor to utilize its resources to support grassroots sports development. He noted that under Republic Act 6847, the law that created the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) in 1990, Pagcor is mandated to remit five percent of its gross income to the PSC's National Sports Development Fund. The fund finances PSC's various plans and programs, including its support for national sports associations and national athletes for training and international competition. The senator added that he would like to focus on the promotion and progress of the national sports development programs in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Committee on Sports.  ",0
The Manila Times,"President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Thursday assured his American counterpart Joe Biden that the Philippines remains the partner, ally and friend of the United States (US). Marcos, who is in the US for a six-day working visit, reaffirmed the long-standing relationship between the two countries during his bilateral talks with Biden here in New York. ""We are your partners, we are your allies, we are your friends. And in like fashion, we have always considered the United States our partner, our ally and our friend,"" Marcos told Biden. ""The relationship, the 100-plus-year-old relationship between the Philippines and the US continues to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century and the events that we have been watching over the past few months really,"" he added. The President also cited the role of the United States in maintaining the peace in our region, which he said ""is something that is much appreciated by all the countries in the regions and the Philippines especially."" ""We feel that we are especially fortunate because we have very strong foundation of a very long relationship and strong relationships in various facets not only political, not only diplomatic, but also economic,"" Marcos said. ""We continue to look to the United States for that continuing partnership and the maintenance of peace in our region. In terms of the geopolitical issues that we face in this day and age, the primary consideration of the Philippines and the guiding principle of the Philippine foreign policy is to encourage peace,"" he added.

The Manila Times,"President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Tuesday (Wednesday in Manila) called on all nations to launch a unified and immediate response against climate change. ""Climate change is the greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples. There is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort, one led by the United Nations,"" Marcos said during his address at the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly here. Marcos lamented that further inaction would result in the extreme suffering of ""least responsible"" smaller nations such as the Philippines. ""The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice: Those who are least responsible suffer the most. The Philippines, for example, is a net carbon sink, we absorb more carbon dioxide than we emit. And yet, we are the fourth most vulnerable country to climate change,"" he said. ""This injustice must be corrected, and those who need to do more must act now. We accept our share of responsibility and will continue to do our part to avert this collective disaster,"" Marcos added. Marcos urged big economies to lead by example. ""We call on industrialized countries to immediately fulfill their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, provide climate financing and technology transfer for adaptation for the most vulnerable and developing countries to lead by example,"" he said. ""When future generations look back, let them not ask why we did not take this opportunity to turn the tide, why did we continue in our profligate ways, until it was too late? This threat knows no borders, no social class, nor any geopolitical considerations. How we address it will be the true test of our time,"" Marcos added. Marcos said he is looking forward to attending COP27, the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 6 to 18. The Climate Change Commission data said natural disasters in the Philippines caused P506 billion in economic losses during the past decade alone. A new study recently released by UN climate experts warned of a catastrophic climate change by 2025 if carbon emission levels remain unchanged. Effect on labor In a related development, Department of Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople has called for more study on the impact of climate change on labor migration and on workers around the world. ""The Philippines is sadly very familiar with the effects of climate change and how it results in the displacement of people,"" Ople said during bilateral talks with International Organization on Migration Director-General Antonio Vitorino in New York City. ""We are also aware of the need to enhance multi-sectoral, multi-agency, and multi-country partnerships to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on migrant workers and communities,"" she added. Ople was joined in the event by United Nations Permanent Representative Antonio Manuel Lagdameo Sr. and Department of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and International Economic Relations Carlos Sorreta.

The Manila Times,"President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said he does not see the Philippines without the United States as a partner, declaring that the ties between the two nations are ""beyond politics."" Marcos renewed his commitment to further boost the Philippines' relations with the US when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday (Tuesday in Manila). ""It is very clear to me in my vision for the way that the country will move forward that I cannot see the Philippines in the future without having the United States as a partner,"" he said. ""I cannot overstate the role the United States has played in the Philippines in every aspect of our lives. And so this is just a continuing evolution, and I believe in strengthening that relationship between the United States and the Philippines,"" he added. The President said that the Philippines and the US ""have strong and enduring ties in trade and commerce, among many other areas of cooperation."" The US is the Philippines' third largest trading partner and second major source of foreign direct investments in 2021. ""Many of the drivers of our early economy were actually American corporations. Many of the strongest corporate benefactors really to government and to the rest of society in the Philippines were coming from the United States,"" Marcos said. ""This has evolved as time has gone on, but the strength of that relationship continues. And we envision a further strengthening of those relationships,"" he added. Marcos said strengthening the Philippines-US alliance and partnerships is ""extremely necessary"" amid growing economic and geopolitical crises worldwide. ""I believe that the political, economic, diplomatic relations that we make, the partnerships that we forged and that we strengthen now are going to be extremely necessary for the simple reason that they provide stability in this highly unstable economic, political, geopolitical, diplomatic environment. This is something that is central to our thinking when it comes to the economic planning for the Philippines,"" he said. ""When we are in crisis, we look to the United States. We look to the relationship that has been forged over the many years, and I have to say the reason that we have done that is that for the most part we can say that the United States has not failed us,"" he added. The President's visit to the US comes amid increasing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly between China and the US, as both countries jostle for global power. Marcos has repeatedly expressed his intent to further strengthen the Philippines' bilateral ties with the US, its traditional ally, during his term as president. Former president Rodrigo Duterte shook up the Philippine-US ties with his pivot to China and Russia as he fired verbal assaults against the US throughout his term. Marcos earlier said he hopes to hold bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden at the sidelines of the 77th United Nations General Assembly where he is set to deliver a speech Tuesday afternoon. His speech will cover the country's vision of people-centered development, highlighting his administration's thrust for recovery after more than two years of pandemic-induced lockdowns. The 77th session of the UNGA will be the first in-person assembly among the heads of state since the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The annual gathering will feature more than 150 world leaders.  ",0
The Manila Times,"HOUSE Committee on Information and Communications Technology Chairman and Navotas Rep. Tobias ""Toby"" Tiangco is confident that Congress will be able to pass the SIM Card Registration bill before the end of the year. The House of Representatives targets to approve the measure on third and final reading before the lower chamber goes on recess on Oct. 1, 2022. The chamber has approved the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Card Registration bill on second reading. ""We will be on recess starting October 1, so let's see if we can pass it this September but definitely the SIM Card Registration will be passed into law within the year,"" Tiangco said. The House version of the bill mandates the mandatory registration of all pre-paid and postpaid cards. ""This is exactly the same bill that was passed in the 18th Congress by the House of Representatives which does not cover the social media registration,"" Tiangco noted. Former president Rodrigo Duterte vetoed the proposed law because of the inclusion of the social media provision in the final version of the measure. Tiangco said once the measure takes effect, all SIM cards must be registered within 180 days after the start of the implementation of the law. ""The House version mandates the need to provide the required information, including the full name, date of birth, gender and the address, and provide a government-issued identification card,"" he said. The measure tasked the seller, telecommunication companies and concerned government agencies to secure the data provided to them. ""The unauthorized release of the data provides P5,000 to P50,000 fine for direct sellers; for telcos, first offense is P300,000, second offense is P500,000 and third offense is P1 million,"" Tiangco said. A separate measure is also pending before his committee on the no call, no email and text promos. Tiangco said the measures will address the proliferation of text scams in the country. ""This is not a silver bullet but it's a first step to identify those behind these text scams,"" he added.  ",0
The Manila Times,"THE Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) has revised the work-from-home or telecommuting guidelines to make the scheme more suitable for hastening economic recovery. Department Order 237, signed by Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma last Friday, September 16, but released to the media on Sunday, laid down the revised implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act 11165 or the ""Telecommuting Act"" after almost two months of consultations with concerned sectors. Aside from other stakeholders, the National Tripartite Industrial Peace Council, a consultative body presided by the Labor secretary and composed of labor and employer representatives, also provided inputs on the policy. Laguesma called on employers and workers to ""jointly adopt and implement telecommuting programs that are based on voluntariness and mutual consent."" These revised rules clarify and adequately address issues and concerns of the telecommuting sector,"" he said. Laguesma made it clear that the alternative work arrangement is voluntary in nature. ""This aims to sustain our efforts for economic recovery,"" he said. ""The terms and conditions of telecommuting shall not be less than minimum labor standards, and shall not in any way diminish or impair the terms and conditions of employment contained in any applicable company policy or practice, individual contract, or collective bargaining agreement,"" the order stated. Telecommuting employees are not considered field personnel, except when their actual hours of work cannot be determined with reasonable certainty.

He said the Philippines’ main interest in the FTA is the export of banana and processed pineapple to South Korea, as these goods are currently levied a 30-percent tariff. The trade official added that the Philippines is also looking at directly supplying South Korea with nickel ore, considering that the latter still imports from China.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and visiting US Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday hailed the “strong” and “enduring” ties between the Philippines and the United States amid global headwinds. “Your visit is a very strong symbol that these relationships remain strong, that these relationships remain important as indeed they do. I have said many times, I do not see a future for the Philippines that does not include the United States,” Marcos told Harris during her courtesy call in Malacañang. In their tete-a-tete, the early part of which was aired on state television, Harris described the Philippine-US relationship as “a long and enduring one” and spoke about “so many opportunities for us to continue to strengthen our relationship” under Marcos’ leadership. Harris cited, among others, “mutual concerns” about regional security, which she said was one basis of bilateral ties between the two nations. “We are both proud members of the Indo-Pacific [region]. And in particular, as it relates to the Philippines, I will say that we must reiterate always that we stand with you in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea,” she said. Harris alluded to the general terms of the 1951 Philippine-US Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), saying “an armed attack on the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US mutual defense commitments.” “And that is an unwavering commitment that we have to the Philippines,” she said. Another basis of bilateral relations, the American vice president added, was mutual commitments to international rules and norms. “Upholding those international rules and norms in all of the ways that we know allow for, again, prosperity and security for our respective nations in the region,” she said. “So again, I will reiterate that the alliance between the United States and the Philippines is a strong and enduring one, and only under your leadership continues to be strengthened. And we look forward to working with you on many of these issues,” she said. “[W]ith more upheavals that we are seeing, not only in the region, but especially in the region, this partnership becomes even more important. The situation is rapidly changing. We must evolve to be properly responsive to that situation. And so that is why it is very important that we continue to progress, that we continue to strengthen, as we redefine those relationships,” he said. Marcos noted that bilateral ties have gone through “different phases of relationship” and since the postwar era “has just been strengthened in every way: in the economic sense, in the political sense, [and] defense security.” “You cannot think of an area where we have not cooperated, collaborated, and have had good results for both our countries,” he said. Harris said she intended to talk with the president about opportunities presented by mutual concerns such as the climate crisis “and what we might do in terms of investments and renewable energy and thinking about clean power and the industries that will come about because of that commitment.” A fact sheet on Harris’ visit to the Philippines released by the White House on Sunday said that the United States and the Philippines were initiating negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement. Once in force, this will provide the legal basis for US exports of nuclear equipment and material to the Philippines. Harris was accompanied in the Palace by her husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, and US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson. She arrived in the Philippines on Sunday night, the first visit in five years by a high-ranking US official since former President Donald Trump visited the country for the 2017 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Vice President Sara Duterte, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez, and other government officials were also present at the courtesy call and tete-a-tete. Mr. Marcos, touching on the US official’s visit to Palawan province today, jestingly told Harris: “I’m sure you’re just going to the resorts and the beaches,” to which she replied, “that is not the life I’ve chosen these days.” ‘Dangerous deals’ In Congress, two of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s allies in the Senate on Monday welcomed the US official’s visit, saying this could signal that the United States was showing its true commitment to defend the Philippines in any conflict in the West Philippine Sea. Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, however, called on the US government to fully commit to the MDT with the Philippines. “That (Harris visit) is an indicator that they are really here for us because otherwise, they could just be ignoring us. But the relationship should be mutual and not one-sided,” he said. Sen. Christopher Go said visiting dignitaries from allied countries were welcome, especially if these would usher in more support for the Philippines such as the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In the House of Representatives, Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez noted that the visit of Harris sent a clear signal to China that the Philippines has US support in the South China Sea dispute. However, Gabriela women’s party list said that Harris’ visit to Palawan might be seen as a provocation, as it slammed the package of “dangerous deals” that the US vice president brought with her. The group cited the civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which House deputy minority leader and ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro also strongly opposed, saying that modular or microreactor nuclear power plants were still in the experimental stage.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos’ recent string of trips abroad is an attempt at “rehabilitating and repackaging” his family’s name in front of the international community. A Makabayan lawmaker made this remark a few days after Mr. Marcos returned from Thailand where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit last week.  On Monday, House deputy minority leader Rep. France Castro said the President’s recent foreign trips were not really for the benefit of Filipinos, but for his family. “The string of foreign trips is more for rehabilitating and repackaging the Marcos name in front of the international community, rather than uplifting the lives of Filipinos,” she said. Castro added: “By hobnobbing with the current movers and shakers of the world, the President is slowly trying to erase the corruption-laden and human rights violations-rife name of his father.” Mr. Marcos’ father, former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., ruled the country for two decades by imposing martial law—a period which was marked by human rights violations. The President returned on Saturday night after attending the Apec summit in Bangkok. Days earlier, he attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Cambodia. Castro noted the President’s remarks during the Apec summit where he raised issues such as food security, pandemic preparedness, the environment and the impact of climate change. “He went to the Apec saying countries must prioritize food security, continue to invest in pandemic preparedness and ensure the resilience of the global health system. But what is happening in the Philippines? Farmers still do not own the land they till and there is also rampant land use conversion of agricultural lands to residential and industrial use of his allies,” she said. She added: “The President also talked about the environment and climate change, but government policies in the Philippines continue to exacerbate such problems due to large scale mining, deforestation and making of mega dams.” Earlier, Mr. Marcos also made state visits to Indonesia and Singapore, followed by a working visit to the United States. In December, the President is expected to attend a summit of the Asean and the European Union to be held in Brussels, Belgium.   ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Ilocos Norte Gov. Matthew Manotoc has pushed for mining opportunities in his province, currently home to the country’s top renewable energy projects. At the four-day Mines Safety and Environment Conference here last week, Manotoc, a nephew of President Marcos, said more than 300,000 hectares in the Marcos stronghold have “abundant metallic and nonmetallic minerals.”   Found in the province are gold, copper, iron, manganese, shale and felspar (used for pottery and ceramics), limestone (essential for water cleansing processes), and aggregates. Manotoc said his province boasts of “diverse resources, competent human capital and a proactive local government, which makes Ilocos Norte a premier investment destination in the north.” ‘Strategic’ location The province is “the renewable energy capital of Southeast Asia” and is host to the “largest wind farms” in the region, the governor said during the third day of the annual summit on Nov. 17. He was apparently referring to a 160-megawatt (MW) wind farm in Pagudpud town, the 150-MW Burgos Wind Farm project in Burgos town and the much older yet scenic 33-MW wind farm in Bangui town, which has become a tourist destination. The province is “strategically suited” for mining, not only because of its mineral deposits, but also because it operates ports that are closer to East Asia, “where tiger economies like China, Japan and Korea are located,” said Manotoc, the son of Sen. Imee Marcos, who also served as governor from 2010-2016. “Laoag (Ilocos Norte’s capital city) is closer to Taiwan than it is to Manila,” he said. Manotoc noted that the province’s bureaucracy and socioeconomic conditions were among Ilocos Norte’s investment advantages. “We are a very peaceful and orderly province. Our crime rate is very, very low (with a 93-percent crime clearance efficiency), a low poverty rate (pegged at 3.1 percent), and we have a young and highly literate populace,” he said. Manotoc added that Ilocos Norte has “good infrastructure and utilities, available skilled labor (56 percent of the population is skilled) and ensures the security of mining concessions.”   The governor noted that these mining concessions were “aligned with the national mineral road map for responsible and sustainable mine industry.” He said 10.7 percent of Ilocos Norte is covered by mining tenements, or rights to explore for minerals.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A heated exchange between Sen. Raffy Tulfo and Sen. Cynthia Villar on the conversion of farmlands to residential areas marked the deliberations on the proposed budget of the Department of Agriculture (DA), which dragged on till the early morning hours on Thursday. Tensions rose as Tulfo asked about two issues in a way that visibly miffed Villar, who was then defending the DA budget: the conversion of farmlands into subdivisions and the negative impact of the rice tariffication law on farmers.  Tulfo stood to ask what the DA had been doing about the “prevalent” irregularities in the construction of farm-to-market roads (FMRs) across the country. “This program is peppered with corruption and is being used by influential politicians for their own benefit; (FMRs) become cockpit-to-market, subdivision-to-market, or resort-to-market roads,” he said. Tulfo further asked how the DA was validating these projects, citing the case of some localities that became “riddled” with the FMRs even though they were not producing rice, corn or vegetables. “Our lowly farmers are being duped because the money that was intended for them to help them bring their produce to the market was being abused by politicians who have seen and are exploiting this loophole in the system,” he said. Villar explained that while funds for FMR come from the DA, it is the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) that builds the roads. The existence of the projects are validated through drone technology, she added. Tulfo asked for a report on all FMRs constructed by the DA, which he said he would use to validate the projects on site. DA-DPWH ‘collusion’ “This is a problem because when collusion happens between the DA and the DPWH, the nation is lost,” he said. During the Duterte administration, the DPWH was headed by Villar’s son and now fellow senator Mark. Through the years, the family, headed by the patriarch, former Senate President Manny Villar, has built a business empire centered on the real estate sector and has also expanded to include shopping malls, convenience stores, coffee and pastry shops, banks, and more recently, broadcasting. Tulfo cited a 2017 Commission on Audit report that flagged P957 million worth of unfinished FMR projects, with only four out of 15 completed.  “This by itself is proof that this program is replete with irregularities,” he said. Tulfo then asked why the DA had been allowing the “massive” conversion of farmlands in the provinces to become housing complexes, which he said was undermining the country’s food security. “The farmlands are shrinking because these are being bought by large [real estate] developers, which is why subdivisions have now spread in the provinces,” he added. ‘We don’t buy agri land’ Villar replied: “You know, that is our business. I want to tell you that we don’t buy agricultural land; we only buy lands in cities and capital towns.” She explained that buyers of the houses sold by her companies only wanted the opportunity to resell the property in times of financial difficulty. “You have to understand that agriculture [is] a business also; you sell your land at a higher price to buy a bigger piece of land in less prime places where you will do your farming,” she said. But Tulfo said the farmers were being exploited when they were forced to sell their farmland at low prices due to decreasing yield and the low selling price of their produce—supposedly due to the rice tariffication law. Under the law (Republic Act No. 11598) signed by then President Rodrigo Duterte in January 2022, annual revenues from tariff collected on rice imports that are in excess of P10 billion shall be distributed as cash assistance to small farmers tilling two hectares of land or less. The scheme will run up to 2024. No guilt At this point, a more assertive Villar reminded Tulfo that she “wrote the law” herself, before explaining why the country needed it to address one of the most pressing challenges for farmers: the high cost of rice production. “I don’t feel any guilt to the small rice farmers; all the money that came from [rice tariffication law] was given to small farmers,” she said.  In response, Tulfo suggested that, instead of allowing farmland conversion, the DA should give farmers capital to buy farm machines and stave off real estate developers. “This is why I am pushing for the passage of the National Land Use Act; four presidents have come and gone but this bill has not been passed, and I wonder why,” he said. Villar said she disagreed with Tulfo on this point, saying a national law was no longer needed for this purpose since local governments already had their respective land use plans. To defuse the tension, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri suspended the session. When it resumed, Tulfo, now apologetic for the lateness of the hour, said he was now too “ashamed” to ask some more questions. He then turned to Villar again and asked: “Madam chair, are you tired?” Villar, now smiling, said she had always been tolerant and suggested that she and Tulfo have a personal session where she could answer his other questions.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The fight against disinformation is a responsibility that should be carried by everyone so more sectors could contribute in combating fake news, according to former Vice President Leni Robredo. Speaking at the Obama Foundation’s Democracy Forum on Friday (Manila time), Robredo, one of the invited speakers, shared with her fellow panelists how a group of academics, journalists, church leaders and civil society groups have come together to initiate a move to check facts seen and shared on social media.  Robredo was referring to the #FactsFirstPH, which is composed of more than 120 groups including several media organizations, civil society organizations and public policy centers from different universities, including business groups. The movement was formed last January at the height of the campaign season. “We try to learn from the best practices around the world. [This] initiative started in the Philippines, which I think bears pushing through even after the campaign,” Robredo said. For Robredo, this should be the “path forward” in the combat against disinformation by pulling everyone together in forming a “broader and more inclusive framework … so that all stakeholders will be able to contribute to the solutions.” Another point she raised was the European Parliament’s passage of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Market Act, which would hold social media firms accountable in the event of a massive spread of disinformation by mandating them to take immediate actions in any case of “illegal contents” being posted. Robredo pointed out that there are lobbyists of similar legislation all over the world or at least those seeking to improve existing laws and policies on responsibilities of social media companies. During the forum, Robredo also said she realized the “mistakes” she and her team committed during the campaign season, especially in their response against the disinformation aimed at her. She acknowledged her “initial stance,” which was to ignore all that malicious information that targeted her since she won as vice president in the 2016 elections. “But we realized, too late, that it was the wrong response,” Robredo said. “It’s like we are trying to correct [this misinformation] but the fact-checking was just being heard in our own echo chambers because there is a separate reality already.”  “It’s like we could not penetrate into the cells that have been created because of disinformation,” she also said. Robredo was named the “biggest fake news victim” by the fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph, with President Marcos, then her rival candidate, benefiting the most especially during the campaign season. To recall, Robredo’s then spokesperson Barry Gutierrez had filed a cyberlibel complaint against Journal News Online for falsely claiming that Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison was her campaign adviser in the last May 9 polls.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III called on the public to oppose the allocation of hundreds of millions of pesos in confidential and intelligence funds (CIF) to agencies not responsible for national security or law enforcement as the country watches government spending while grappling with a ballooning national debt. In a radio interview on Saturday, Pimentel said the formation of a Senate oversight committee on CIF cannot justify such funding in the national budget to agencies like the Department of Education (DepEd) that do not have the mandate to conduct surveillance work and intelligence gathering.  Pimentel, with help from fellow opposition Sen. Risa Hontiveros, was hopeful that they would get enough votes from other senators to back his move to delete the proposed confidential funds—mainly the P500 million for the office of Vice President Sara Duterte and the P150 million for DepEd also headed by Duterte. “We hope (fellow lawmakers will join us), especially once they feel the mounting public pressure that the people are now alarmed why we are giving P500 million in confidential funds for the OVP (Office of Vice President) and another P150 million for the DepEd,” he said. Pimentel said the ordinary Filipino taxpayers should also question the propriety of appropriating confidential and intelligence funds to agencies with no clear mandate to use them.“This is the time our people should now take part, first by understanding what confidential funds are,” he added. One of the main features of such funds is that they are not audited in the same transparent way that funds of other agencies are, making them open to misuse, abuse and corruption.  COA refusal At a budget hearing in the House of Representatives in September, opposition Rep. Edcel Lagman questioned the refusal by the Commission on Audit (COA) to disclose details of the use of confidential funds, including liquidation reports. Lagman warned that if the postaudit was “covered by secrecy and not disclosed to this very House that appropriates funds, that makes the audit more imaginary and possibly not being done seriously and effectively.” Last week, he called for a purge of “unnecessary, excessive” CIFs, saying that “no stretch of the imagination or flexibility of logic” could justify P9.3 billion for confidential and intelligence spending by several government agencies. These funds are “shrouded in mystery” and the COA itself could not disclose to the Congress and the public how these are used, the Albay representative said. “These funds breed corruption, and the more enormous the funds are, the greater the magnitude is for the possibility of graft,” Lagman pointed out.  Pimentel said he and Hontiveros would likely propose amendments to the P5.26-trillion general appropriations bill for 2023 mainly to rechannel some of the P9.3-billion CIF allocation to important but unfunded items. The senator questioned how the Department of Budget and Management, with all its staff, could have missed seeing the “glaring disparity” in the distribution of government funds. Dwarfs AFP, PNP, PDEA “If on one hand, we cannot justify the funding for some agencies that are glutted with funds, while other important programs are hungry for funds, then there is something wrong with our budget process,” Pimentel said. Budget documents showed that of the P9.3-billion CIF, the Office of the President would get the biggest share amounting to P4.5 billion—P2.25 billion for intelligence and P2.25 billion for confidential funds. The CIF that President Marcos is set to get is larger than the combined amounts allocated for the intelligence fund of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (P1.74 billion), the Philippine National Police (P800 million) and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (P500 million). The National Bureau of Investigation was allocated P175.4 million in intelligence funds, while the government’s main prosecutorial arm, the Department of Justice, had an allotment of P168 million in confidential funds, according to budget records. The government’s premier intelligence unit, the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency will get P141 million in intelligence funds, which is P9 million less than the proposed confidential fund for DepEd. No CIF for DICT Pimentel said the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), which would need funds for surveillance to combat online fraud, was not given any CIF. He said the agencies and programs that lacked funds included the senior citizens’ pension fund, which needed at least P25 billion, and Philippine Postal Corp. which should have gotten P500 million as reimbursement for the government’s mailing services. For some agencies that are entitled to CIF, the Senate minority will appeal that these be set at reasonable amounts. For others that received huge sums, they will seek a reduction, Pimentel said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The House of Representatives has passed on final reading a measure providing for enhanced protection, security, and benefits for those working in the media industry. Congressmen voted 252 with no abstentions to approve on the third reading House Bill No. 454 or the “Media Workers’ Welfare Act,” a consolidation of five similar bills.  House Speaker Martin Romualdez said Congress “regards the Fourth Estate as an essential partner in nation building and in protecting our democracy.” “The approval of the measure highlights the importance we in the House give to promoting the welfare of media personnel and ensuring that the press remains free,” he said in a statement.  If enacted into law, HB 454 will apply to all media workers and media entities in the private sector. The measure provides that the minimum compensation for media workers should not be less than the applicable minimum wage set by the Regional Tripartite Wage and Productivity Board. They will be also entitled to overtime and night shift pay as provided under the Labor Code and related laws. Media workers shall be covered by the Social Security System, Home Development Mutual Fund or Pag-IBIG Fund, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. or PhilHealth upon employment. The employer and the media worker will share in the payment of monthly premiums in accordance with existing rules. Media workers required to physically report for work in dangerous places like embattled and disease-stricken areas will receive a hazard pay of P500 a day, and shall be provided with safety gear like bulletproof vests and protective equipment by their employer.  They are also entitled to P200,000 death benefit, disability benefit of up to P200,000, and medical insurance of up to P100,000. The bill further provides that a media worker shall be deemed a regular employee after six months from the start of their employment. An employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause and with the observance of due process, it also states. The Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) regional offices will settle all labor-related disputes concerning the media worker and the employer. In addition, the bill holds media entities as responsible for all content released in their platforms, including those produced by block timers. However, exemption is when the media entity is able to prove that they exercised due diligence, or that the fault, misconduct or violation of law was done solely by the media worker or block timer. The DOLE secretary will be tasked to create a News Media Tripartite Council, which shall serve as a link among various stakeholders. The council will also provide a platform where media workers and employers can agree on mutually beneficial policies and programs and settle disputes.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"It has been a year since the officer in charge of the Department of National Defense (DND), Undersecretary Jose Faustino Jr., retired from military service. He is therefore no longer covered by the one-year appointment ban on retired military officials. But still there is no word from Malacañang whether Faustino would be named full-fledged defense secretary.  “We are still waiting for news from the Office of the President,” DND spokesperson Arsenio Andolong told reporters on Thursday. Faustino, the 10th Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief to serve under then President Rodrigo Duterte, stepped down from the AFP on Nov. 12 last year upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 56 and after a stint as chief of staff that lasted just a little over three months. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. actually named Faustino defense secretary in June. But due to the appointment ban, he could only be officially designated as senior undersecretary and DND officer in charge. “Faustino is being tapped as senior undersecretary and officer in charge of the Department of National Defense, a post he would later assume as secretary on Nov. 13, 2022, in compliance with the one-year ban on the appointment of retired military officers under Republic Act No. 6975,” the Palace then said. The year-long ban lapsed during the weekend but there was no announcement from the Office of the President whether Faustino would be retained and finally given the rank of secretary, which would require a separate appointment paper. Floating status The AFP has also found itself in an unprecedented situation regarding its top brass. Months after he assumed office in August, the current chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Bartolome Vicente Bacarro, could not yet earn his four-star rank that is supposedly reserved for his position. The reason: his predecessor, Gen. Andres Centino, remains in active service and won’t be retiring until February next year. Centino was recently nominated as the country’s ambassador to India after President Marcos decided not to keep him as AFP chief. But he remained on a floating status as far as the AFP is concerned, making the four-star rank unavailable to Bacarro. “He is considered for an ambassadorial post and he will be considered retired if he gets it. The four-star rank is still with him. When he retires immediately after his appointment, then General Bacarro will get it (the fourth star),” Faustino said, albeit without explaining why Centino still got that rank despite Mr. Marcos’ decision not to retain him. Malacanang said in August that Centino would be appointed to a new position “befitting a former chief of staff.”  When Bacarro took the helm of the AFP on Aug. 8, the position he vacated at the Southern Luzon Command — which covers the regions of Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon), Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque and Romblon, except Palawan) and Bicol — was filled in by a one-star general in an acting capacity. Under Republic Act No. 11709, the new law that sets fixed terms for senior officials occupying key positions, Bacarro is the first AFP chief who will have a predetermined tenure of three years even if he turns 56 this year. The law was signed by then President Rodrigo Duterte in April and took effect on July 1. Delays at the top Appointments to at least four other key positions in the AFP — vice chief of staff, Navy flag officer in command, and heads of the Southern Luzon and Western Mindanao commands—had also been delayed while the law’s implementing rules and regulations (IRR) were still being formulated. On Sept. 9, AFP vice chief of staff Lt. Gen. Erickson Gloria and Navy chief Vice Adm. Adeluis Bordado, retired from the service without their successors being named. On Oct. 4, Lt. Gen. Alfredo Rosario, head of the Western Mindanao Command, stepped down also without an immediate replacement. The Inquirer learned that some military officers had found the new law to be causing some uncertainty with regards to promotions, but Faustino said “the improved IRR somehow mitigated (the law’s) unintended consequences.” Faustino said the AFP had since taken steps to explain the new law to its personnel especially during visits to field units. The AFP earlier pointed out that the new law was intended to put an end to the so-called revolving door policy in the appointment of chiefs of staff. “This ensures that only the best officers ascend the ladder of leadership… puts an end to the revolving door system in the AFP leadership that resulted from the retirement law passed in 1979,” then Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A day after President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. pushed for the completion of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said his country would work closely with nations in the region to ensure peace and stability on the basis of mutual respect for international law. On Saturday, Li told Mr. Marcos that he looked forward to working with the Philippines in forging unity and cooperation between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) amid persisting tensions. Mr. Marcos conversed briefly with Li on the sidelines of the Asean Plus Three Summit here on Saturday. The Asean Plus Three consists of Asean’s member states and China, Japan and South Korea.During their conversation, the Chinese premier pushed for the continued growth of relations between Manila and Beijing. “I look forward to working with the Philippines to uphold the unity and cooperation between China and Asean,” he said. “I also look forward to working with the Philippines and other countries in Asean for peace and stability in South China Sea on the basis of mutual respect and respect for the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Let’s work together for successful meetings,” Li told Mr. Marcos. On Friday, Mr. Marcos called on all parties to work toward crafting the code that would set guidelines on claimants’ actions in the disputed South China Sea. He earlier lamented the slow progress in the conclusion of the code. Mr. Marcos said the completion of the document would be an “example of how states manage their differences.” “I, therefore, welcome the progress on textual negotiations on the Code of Conduct this past year and hopefully an approved code of conduct in the very near future,” he said. The President is expected to make a state visit to China in the first week of January next year.During their talk on Saturday morning, Mr. Marcos and Li agreed to further deepen the partnership between their countries.“I believe there should be continued growth of China-Philippines relations. What we have in common far outweighs our differences,” Li said. In response, the President thanked Li for remembering his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and “his initiative to come to China.” “It was he after all who made Philippines and China family… It was something very important to us. He has been proven right because the partnership with China has been a great benefit to both our countries. So I look forward to discussing all of these when I come to visit in January,” Mr. Marcos said.He also had a brief talk with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on the sidelines of the Asean Plus Three Summit, during which both leaders agreed to strengthen the partnership of the two nations. During the 19th Asean-India Summit also on Saturday, the President urged members of the regional bloc to work closely with India to ensure better access to medicines and vaccines, calling India the “pharmacy of the world.”  “Asean friends, let us not miss the opportunity of having the ‘pharmacy of the world’ as our close neighbor and dialogue partner. The high cost of life-saving medicines and vaccines are barriers to a healthy population,” Mr. Marcos said. The President asked for India’s and Australia’s support for the Philippines as Asean’s candidate to the United Nations Security Council from 2027 to 2028.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Sultan of Brunei has pledged to continue supporting the Philippines’ efforts to maintain peace and stability in Mindanao. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah made the commitment on Saturday when he met President Marcos for a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 40th and 41st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summits here.   “We will continue to support your government’s efforts in ensuring peace and stability through various initiatives in southern Philippines including our participation in the unification and modification assistance,” the Sultan assured Mr. Marcos. Brunei is part of the International Monitoring Team and the independent decommissioning body in the Mindanao peace process. In response, the Chief Executive recognized the role that the Brunei sultanate played in the peace process, which he said has been proceeding despite challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “I’m happy to be able to inform Your Majesty that the peace process is proceeding along, although we have extended the Transition Authority for another three years simply because they were unable to do their job during the pandemic,” the President said. 1st time at Asean summit He added: “This process—the negotiations between the Bangsamoro and our Muslim brothers and sisters began in 1976—I believe, is the fruition of that. And we are very happy.” Bolkiah was one of six state leaders that the President met for bilateral talks on the sidelines of the Asean Summits here, which closed on Sunday noon. It was Mr. Marcos’ first time to attend the Asean Summits since he assumed office earlier this year. On his first day in Cambodia, Mr. Marcos held bilateral meetings with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen. On Saturday, he held bilateral talks with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Bolkiah. On Sunday, Mr. Marcos was scheduled to sit down for bilateral meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the European Union. The Chief Executive also had brief conversations with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on the sidelines of the Asean Plus Three Summit on Saturday.   Years of hard work In his bilateral meeting with Brunei, the President informed Bolkiah of a parliamentary election in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2025. Mr. Marcos expressed optimism that the Bangsamoro region will have a functioning autonomous government as the result of many years of hard work to achieve peace in Mindanao. The President also told the Brunei Sultan that he is glad that the Philippines was able to be of help to Brunei’s health-care system, especially at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are very proud of our health-care workers, especially during the pandemic where worldwide they have been recognized as they are, for their competence and for their sacrifices.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III on Monday called on his colleagues to delete the proposed P500 million in confidential funds for the Office of the Vice President (OVP), as the agency, as defined by Congress, is not entitled to receive such funding. In his interpellation of the OVP budget, Pimentel said Congress should instead rechannel the funds for more important programs and allow agencies to perform their mandate.   He questioned why the Senate committee report retained the P2.3 billion funding for Vice President Sara Duterte, which “ballooned” from the P709 million originally proposed by the agency. “In due time, I will move for the deletion of the budget item of P500 million for the OVP. It is my position that the OVP is not entitled to confidential funds, going by the definition that we in Congress crafted,” he said. The Senate finance committee approved the referral of its committee report on the budget of the OVP supposedly without any change from the previously proposed P2.3 billion. Budget almost triple Pimentel noted that in the budget briefing, Duterte did not try to justify the proposed P500 million confidential fund for her office, contrasted to how the Office of the President stood firm on their justification of the P4.5-billion confidential and intelligence funds. Citing the OVP’s proposals, Pimentel expressed concern that the agency may already be duplicating other programs already performed by other agencies. “So that will explain the budget will almost triple from current amounts because of these programs that the OVP seeks to undertake,” he said.  Aquilino Pimentel III Sen. Risa Hontiveros, for her part, disclosed that the Senate finance panel has added nearly P1 billion to the 2023 budget of the Department of Education (DepEd), as she insisted that the Education Secretary and Vice President’s request for P150 million in confidential funds was not justified. Hontiveros appealed to her colleagues to just siphon off the confidential funds to other concerns, such as the education programs for indigenous people and students with special needs. No compelling reasons Netizens earlier blasted the government after the DepEd’s proposed outlay of P532 million for the special education was not included in the National Expenditure Program for next year.   “I hope our colleagues in the Senate will share the view that there are no extraordinarily compelling reasons to provide a confidential fund to the education agency,” Hontiveros said. While she was supportive of the DepEd’s efforts to provide quality basic education, the senator said education officials should be more prudent in utilizing taxpayer money allocated for Filipino learners. “These confidential funds will be better spent for the important needs of the young students,” Hontiveros added. She lauded her colleagues, particularly Sen. Pia Cayetano, for introducing amendments that increased the DepEd’s outlay by P912 million.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano on Tuesday criticized the proposed P256.7-billion funding of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for repairs of roads, bridges, and dikes in 2023, which, he said, seemed to indicate the poor quality of its infrastructure projects over the years. During Senate plenary deliberations on the proposed 2023 budget of the DPWH, Cayetano noted that the funding for “maintenance and rehabilitation” dwarfed the agency’s P140-billion allocation for new public infrastructure next year.   “If we add all the funding for individual items for maintenance and rehabilitation, this is more than P200 billion, which is like almost a third of the entire DPWH budget. This is not a ‘Build Better More’ budget; this is ‘Maintenance pa More’ budget,” he said. From BBB to BBM Cayetano raised the issue as the Senate debated DPWH’s proposed P737.3-billion budget in 2023, now billed as the “Build Better More” program, after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s initials, from the previous administration’s “Build Build Build” program. He noted that DPWH’s “asset preservation program,” a technical term for maintenance and rehabilitation, only had half of the budget for a“network development program” in the General Appropriations Acts of 2019, 2020, and 2021. “Then there [must be] something wrong with the kind of public works that we do, because if we are doing a one-is-to-one preservation of the projects that we build, it could only mean that either it is poorly done, or that the structure is already too old,” Cayetano said. He acknowledged that the projects intended for maintenance works originated from the Duterte administration that began in 2016. Inconsistent With the way the DPWH apportioned its share of the budget for 2023, it seemed to be more concerned about repair works, Cayetano said, adding that this was inconsistent with Marcos’ directive. “You’ll have to inform the president because he was expecting that it will be ‘Build Better More,’ not ‘Better Better Maintenance,” Cayetano said, indirectly addressing DPWH officials. Cayetano also questioned why the DPWH was seeking a total funding of P1.5 billion for maintenance even for newly constructed foreign-assisted projects. “So why will you have preventive maintenance for a project that you are still doing? Isn’t it that preventive maintenance supposed to be for projects that have already been completed?” he asked.   Cayetano added that upon poring over the 2023 budget of the DPWH line by line, he spotted many smaller items scattered in various categories intended for “maintenance, repair, and retrofitting works.” The senator urged the DPWH to lean toward building new infrastructure, especially in regions in need of better roads and bridges.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A Philippine delegation taking part in the upcoming Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the United Nations Human Rights Council has urged the Marcos administration to be truthful, saying that “nothing short of an honest admission of the human rights situation in the Philippines would make [it] believable in the eyes of the world.” “If the Philippine government wishes respect, it must sincerely promise to stop human rights violations and prosecute past perpetrators,” said the Philippine UPR Watch amid its expectation that the administration would “present again” an ideal picture of the country’s human rights situation. The group, which had already left for Geneva to attend the UPR set next week, said it would “confirm and validate firsthand to the international community that the Philippine government has reneged on its commitment to respect and uphold the rights of the Filipino people, and it perpetuated and institutionalized impunity for violations.” The Philippine UPR Watch delegation this year is composed of individual advocates and human rights defenders from Karapatan, National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, National Council of Churches in the Philippines, Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Council for Health and Development, Ibon Foundation, Bayan, Rise Up for Life and for Rights, Ramento Project of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Sandugo-Movement of Moro and Indigenous Peoples for Self-Determination, and Cordillera People’s Alliance. Representing civil society, the group has been actively engaged in the UPR process since the first cycle in April 2008. The UPR, which evaluates the human rights records of the UN’s 193 members, bases its assessment on information provided by the state under review which can take the form of a “national report”; information contained in the reports of independent human rights experts and groups known as the Special Procedures, human rights treaty bodies, and other UN entities; and information from other stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and civil society groups. Committee recommendations The Philippine UPR Watch delegation said it would compel the government to observe the recent recommendations of the UN Human Rights Committee. In its advanced, unedited 13-page report dated Nov. 3, the 18-member committee of human rights experts recommended that the Philippines “strengthen cooperation with international human rights bodies, including the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) amid continuing reports of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) under the drug war.” The expert panel was “particularly concerned” by reports of incitement to violence by both past and present government officials, including former President Rodrigo Duterte, as well as the “continued failure” of local authorities to promptly and independently investigate EJKs and bring perpetrators to justice. The committee urged the government to “put an end to EJKs and [take] steps to replace an exclusively punitive approach to drug control with an approach fully in line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” Its recommendations were part of a long list of human rights issues and recommendations made just before the country submits itself to the UPR process.   Red-tagging Last month, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla met with the UN in Switzerland to reaffirm President Marcos’ commitment to the drug war. He also pushed back against criticisms that “Red-tagging”—accusing someone of being a communist or a sympathizer—was a threat, saying it was part of democracy. But the UN committee appeared unconvinced and even called on the government to end Red-tagging and promptly investigate all human rights violations against rights defenders, activists and journalists. For Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes, the language used by the committee showed that Remulla’s claims “did not sit well with [it].” ‘Not convinced’ “The committee clearly recognized that Red-tagging was a threat to human rights defenders and must therefore be stopped. It is not protected speech, contrary to the claims of the justice secretary,” he said. The committee further recommended that all victims of human rights violations should have access to compensation schemes similar to the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act which sought to indemnify martial law victims. It also asked the government to review and amend the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 and refrain from using counterterrorism and criminal legislation to curtail freedom of expression and assembly. At the same time, it sought the release of former Sen. Leila de Lima, who is still detained on what her supporters say are fabricated charges of drug trafficking. According to Reyes, the list of recommendations showed that the experts “do not appear swayed by the claim that the justice system in the country is working for the victims of human rights violations.” “They are not convinced that the human rights situation has greatly improved,” ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday said trees should be planted in the denuded uplands of the two Maguindanao provinces to prevent a repeat of last week’s deadly landslides after seeing for himself what environmentalists for years had been warning the government on what would happen not only in Mindanao but also in other parts of the country. Marcos, accompanied by Maguindanao del Sur Gov. Bai Mariam Sangki-Mangudadatu, flew over the areas devastated by the landslides and flash floods that followed heavy rains brought by Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (international name: Nalgae).   “I was pointing out to the governor that in all those places where there are trees, the ground did not move. All the damage that you saw on the mountains, it’s because they were bald,” Marcos said. “We know and we’ve been hearing this over and over again, but we continue cutting trees, so what happens are landslides like those,” he said. After his aerial inspection, the president and his party landed at Datu Odin Sinsuat, capital of Maguindanao del Norte, where he met officials of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Almost wiped off map The town includes Barangay Kusiong, which was nearly wiped off the map by tons of mud, rocks, and boulders that came crashing down on the village on Friday last week. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported on Tuesday that of 61 who died in the floods and landslides in BARMM, 42 were from Datu Odin Sinsuat. Kusiong lies at the foot of the 446-meter Mt. Minandar. Rescuers on Monday waded through thigh-deep mud in the village using long pieces of wood to search for bodies buried under the rubble. Twelve of the dead in Kusiong, including seven from one family, were buried on Monday in two mass graves dug by a backhoe. Mourners, who survived the landslide, laid flowers and candles at the site.   Flood control planning “We have shifted our operation from search and rescue to retrieval because the chances of survival after two days are almost nil,” said BARMM Interior Minister Naguib Sinarimbo. The President told officials of BARMM, which includes Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte, that tree planting should be included in their long-term flood control projects. “If there had been trees up there, in Kusiong, that would not have happened,” Marcos said. “That’s unfortunate … I am very clear in my mind that that (tree planting) is something we could have done.” He said he could refer them to “plenty” of nongovernmental organizations that could help in reforestation. He did not mention which groups. He also did not say what measures would be taken to stop people from cutting down trees in fragile forests. He said the Department of Environment and Natural Resources would also assist them in making tree planting sustainable, adding that during disasters, folks whose crops were destroyed would often resort to logging to make ends meet. “The new way to do it is to make the locals themselves the owners of the trees so that they will take care of them,” he said. ‘Strange’ Reacting to the president’s remarks about the denuded forests, Jon Bonifacio, spokesperson for the environmental group Kalikasan, told the Inquirer that it was “strange that it seems like it’s only now he’s come to appreciate the benefits provided by well-conserved watersheds.” “Let’s also not forget the massive deforestation that took place under his father’s rule,” he added. Worsened under Marcos Sr. “As Marcos Jr. just found out, environmental destruction has deadly consequences—and, if the government is serious at all about climate change, it needs to put a stop to the destructive mining, megadam and reclamation projects that are cutting down the very forests he’s worried about.” Bonifacio said.  In a column published by the Inquirer in 2011, former Kalikasan spokesperson Marjorie Pamintuan said that deforestation “further worsened” during the dictatorial regime of the President’s father and namesake. “The logging industry was controlled by foreign companies and the local elite, some even holding public offices. Timber licensing agreements were given out by the Marcos regime to loyalists. From 1965 to 1986, the Philippines lost 7 million ha of forests,” she said. She wrote the column six months before Severe Tropical Storm “Sendong” (international name: Washi) caused massive floods that rampaged through the cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan in December 2011, killing more than 1,000 people. Due to deforestation and the large amount of rainfall then in the highlands of Bukidnon, the floodwaters easily rushed down to low-lying areas. In December the following year, Typhoon “Pablo” (international name: Bopha) also caused deadly landslides in mountainous areas in Davao de Oro, which were blamed on mining and logging activities that denuded the once-forested slopes of the towns of New Bataan and Monkayo. Nearly 1,000 people died. Better coordination Aside from reforestation, the president also said the regional government should establish its own public works and highways district offices to quickly repair damaged infrastructure during calamities. These offices should be on standby as damaged or destroyed bridges are the most difficult to repair but roads are easier to fix, he said. The president raised the need for improved coordination between the BARMM regional government and its local governments units (LGUs) in times of disasters and emergencies. “And then the [coordination] procedures. I know that you are just drawing up your procedures now, but you can see why this is so important,” he said. The President said that he also noticed that the regional government and LGUs do not have joint operations, which could maximize the use of their assets. “In BARMM areas or LGUs with bigger populations, you should join forces [with local leaders] so that we can maximize. The coordination [among yourselves] should be enhanced,” Marcos said.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The former chief of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and two others petitioned the Supreme Court on Thursday to save the transmission logs of the May elections—only days before the law allows their deletion—so the “historically important” data may be reviewed in a future case. Former Information and Communications Technology Secretary Eliseo Rio Jr. noted that under the cybercrime law or Republic Act No. 10175, data provided by a service provider “shall be preserved for a minimum period of six months from the date of… receipt.”   This means the transmission logs may be expunged on Nov. 9 or six months after their entry on May 9. “Time is of the essence,” the 100-page court pleading read in part. In a message to the Inquirer, Rio confirmed the filing of the petition after earlier sounding the alarm on the timing difference of the peak transmissions between the transparency server and official Commission on Elections (Comelec) data, among other peculiarities. The two other petitioners were National Citizens’ Movement for Free Elections chair Augusto Lagman, a former elections commissioner, and Franklin Ysaac, former president of Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines. Respondent telcos Their petition for mandamus was accompanied by a prayer for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block the respondents from modifying, erasing or deleting the subscriber data, cyber traffic data log integrity and call record details transmitted from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on May 9, Election Day. Named respondents were Comelec and technology provider Smartmatic, along with the three major telecommunication firms Smart Communications Inc., Dito Telecommunity Corp. and Globe Telecom Inc. At the same time, the petitioners urged the high court to require the respondent telcos to deliver copies of those records. Comelec spokesperson Rex Laudiangco called the filing of the petition “a much welcome development wherein all parties including the Comelec will be able to respond to all issues under judicial processes.” “The Comelec, as always, will abide by any order or process of the Supreme Court,” he added.   The petition quoted excerpts from “viral social media postings,” referring to Rio’s recent posts on Facebook questioning the 1.5 million votes transmitted from at least 2,000 vote counting machines (VCMs), each representing a clustered polling precinct, to the Comelec’s transparency server just 17 minutes after voting ended at 7 p.m. ‘Timely and ripe’  The former DICT head had noted that the transparency server handled by the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) saw peak transmission at 8:02 p.m. on May 9 but Comelec data showed that the highest volume came in at around 9:30 p.m., or over an hour later. Rio wondered why the transparency server had logged more than 20 million votes an hour after the voting closed, but Comelec data indicated that only 12 million votes were transmitted within that period. “It seems that the transparency server was conditioning the minds of the public as to what the official results will be,” Rio said in a recent statement. The court filing, according to the petitioners, was “timely and ripe” as the files could be deleted at any time on or after Nov. 9. Under RA 10175, law enforcement authorities may order “a one-time extension” of the preservation of files when the data are to be used as evidence in a case, which “shall be deemed a notification to preserve the computer data until the termination of the case.” The petitioners described their filing as “a special civil action for mandamus aiming to compel respondents to perform an easy task requiring virtually zero budget: save transcendentally important historical data or at least share copies thereof with the Honorable Supreme Court.” ‘Harmless request’ “The prayer here does not call for any tectonic shift in policy. The prayer here is a harmless request asking the telecommunication companies to keep, not delete, data that someday may inspire patriotism in the hearts of the youth and future citizens of our country,” they said. Rio said the Comelec “can no longer use the excuse that these simple requests require voluminous data, for it will be only seen as ridiculous delaying tactics.”  Laudiangco earlier brushed off allegations of irregularities in the election results, saying “there are many ways to preserve” the data sought by Rio’s group, including filing a request with Comelec. He also dispelled speculations of “preloaded” poll results, pointing out that all the VCMs, memory or secure digital cards, servers and other software used had passed final testing and sealing witnessed by stakeholders. President Marcos was proclaimed by Congress as the winner of the May elections by a majority 31.6 million votes of 55.5 million votes cast. His closest rival, former Vice President Leni Robredo, and other presidential candidates did not contest the results.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Malacañang on Sunday said President Marcos, as concurrent secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA), has enhanced efforts to provide fertilizer vouchers to farmers to help them increase their rice production. Undersecretary Cheloy Garafil, officer in charge of the Office of the Press Secretary, said in a statement that the DA recently issued Memorandum Order No. 65 updating the guidelines on the implementation of a fertilizer discount voucher project under the National Rice Program.   ADVERTISING The project, which covers regions with farms planted with inbred and hybrid rice seeds, except for the National Capital Region and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, will provide discounts on the retail price of urea fertilizers to eligible beneficiaries. “The use of fertilizer vouchers offers an alternative to farmers with lowered purchasing power to buy a sufficient volume of urea recommended for their rice area,” MO 65 stated. It said the overall aim of the project is “ultimately, food security.” Easing production decline For the 2022-23 dry season, in particular, the project aims to enable rice farmers to supplement the requirement for urea fertilizer for their rice production. Mitigating the impacts of the projected decline in rice production due to the low usage of urea fertilizer, the program will help attain the target yield of 4.22 metric tons per hectare of palay for 2023, and stabilize the rice supply situation in the country despite challenges in the price of commercial fertilizer, the memo added. According to the latest data from the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA), the average price from Oct. 24 to 28 of prilled urea was P2,523.68 per 50-kilo bag while for granular urea, the average price was P2,490.35. This was down from its peak of nearly P3,000 last June but still up by 36 percent from P1,830.84 a year ago, FPA data showed. The project has two components: first for the 2022 wet season funded under the 2022 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and the second for the 2022-2023 dry season financed by the 2022 GAA and the unprogrammed funds of the DA. The department had a total of P4.1 billion in unprogrammed appropriations this year. In determining the voucher value per cropping season, the DA said, the amount or fund source is divided into the number of hectares to be served under the project to complement the inbred and hybrid seed distribution program of the rice program. For the 2022 wet cropping season, the fertilizer vouchers will be used by farmer-beneficiaries to claim the inorganic fertilizers, organic fertilizers, foliar fertilizers, biological fertilizers or biological stimulants at accredited merchants.   The discount vouchers will have values equivalent to P1,131 per hectare for inbred rice, and P2,262 per hectare for hybrid. The discount vouchers are for one-time use only and may be claimed at any accredited fertilizer merchant in the preferred area of the farmer-beneficiaries. For the 2022-23 dry cropping season, vouchers may be claimed by their beneficiaries at their preferred DA-accredited dealers, distributors and outlets. The discount voucher value will be computed based on the rice farm area, with farmers tilling half a hectare and below getting as much as P3,300 in discount and those tilling 0.51 to two hectares getting up to P6,600 per hectare. Farmer-beneficiaries belonging to cooperatives and associations may designate an authorized representative to claim their vouchers for them. The President last Friday met with officials of the Makati City-based Chen Yi Agventures, a leading regional rice processing center specializing in sustainable agricultural production, and listened to their proposals on how to help farmers affected by the increasing prices of fertilizers. “This step is part of our engagement with the private sector to listen to the voices of those belonging to our agriculture sector. In relation to this, we will subject to stringent study the proposals made by [Chen Yi Agventures],” he said in a social media post. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The priorities mirrored in the Marcos administration’s P5.3-trillion national budget for 2023 are “misplaced” as nearly P480 billion in lump-sum allotments may end up being squandered, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said on Sunday. “It’s a ‘business as usual’ budget with no focus… It’s misplaced,” Pimentel said of President Marcos’ maiden spending program in a radio interview while arguing that next year’s government outlay should bankroll concrete programs to increase domestic food production.   READ: Pimentel flags P544B lump-sum in DPWH proposed budget Pimentel said he and fellow opposition Sen. Risa Hontiveros will try to persuade their colleagues to excise from the proposed national budget, which he described as “lump-sum and unprogrammed funds” when the Senate starts its plenary debates on the General Appropriations Bill starting on Monday. The Senate finance committee, headed by Sen. Sonny Angara, has been holding budget hearings over the congressional recess that started Sept. 30. Both houses of Congress resume sessions on Monday. ‘Objectionable’ The Senate minority leader noted that while the budget of the Department of Agriculture was increased to almost P164 billion, many of the projects that it intends to fund, such as the construction of farm-to-market roads, did not have direct impact on food production. He also took the executive branch to task for allotting billions of pesos in taxpayer money to items that lacked specific details as required by the Constitution. The funds allotted to these spending programs of various state agencies will only be wasted and misappropriated, Pimentel warned. He said among these “objectionable” proposed budget items were the P300 billion allotted for “support to foreign-assisted projects” and the more than P9 billion in intelligence funds of civilian agencies. According to Pimentel, the funds for these should have been funneled to calamity mitigation and assistance programs, food production projects and additional monthly pension for senior citizens. The senator also called on his fellow lawmakers not to let Mr. Marcos take away the congressional authority to approve budget items, arguing that the Constitution clearly gave the “power of the purse” to the Senate and the House of Representatives.   “The budget items that lacked details should be the concern of Congress since it has the power of the purse,” Pimentel said. “Because if these items did not have details, it’s akin to giving the President the authority to decide, which projects will get funding. So it’s like Congress surrendering its power of the purse,” he reiterated. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that he did not believe an alleged key conspirator in the killing of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa died of natural causes inside prison. He then ordered a more thorough investigation of his death and to find the mastermind of the radioman-vlogger’s assassination.   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the National Information and Communications Technology Summit 2022 in Manila, the President said he was not ruling out possible foul play in the death of Cristito Villamor Palaña, an inmate at New Bilibid Prison (NBP). “I am still not satisfied that it was natural causes. So, I told them to look into this carefully because there are ways to kill a person that do not show up in the medicolegal,” he said. Palaña died on Oct. 18, a day after confessed gunman Joel Escorial surrendered to police, pointing to him as the “middleman” who contracted the killing of Mabasa for P550,000. Palaña’s body was autopsied by the National Bureau of Investigation on Oct. 20, after it was embalmed. The NBI did not specify the cause of death in its report. ‘Who gave the order?’ The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) said Palaña was rushed to the NBP hospital after he was found unconscious and died at 2:05 p.m. after efforts to revive him failed. A second autopsy has been conducted by forensic pathologist Dr. Raquel Fortun. Her report is expected on Friday, Remulla said. While the toxicology report said there was no poison or drugs found in the remains of Palaña, Marcos wanted investigators to dig deeper. He said he wanted to unmask the mastermind in the killing of Mabasa. “So, the investigation is ongoing. But more importantly, is to really trace where it came from. Who gave the order? That is what we are working on now,” he said.   The president said he had been discussing the developments of the case with Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos “three, four, five times a day.” “Let’s investigate carefully. Let’s find out who is behind this. Until now, we cannot be sure,” he said. Sen. Risa Hontiveros had called on the president to speak directly about Mabasa’s killing, saying his words would bring the “full weight of his office” in resolving the case and in providing more protection for the victim’s family. 10 persons of interest Remulla told reporters that at least 10 “persons of interest” in Mabasa’s killing, including several who had been identified by a woman under the government’s witness protection program, were now in the custody of the authorities. The woman, known only as Marissa, is a sister of Palaña. Another sister of the late inmate is also under the witness protection program, he said. Remulla said those in custody included Escorial, Jose Villamor, Palaña’s cousin, who is also an inmate at NBP, and Christopher Bacoto, the alleged “second middleman.” He said the others were four BuCor inmates, one under military custody and the two Palaña sisters. Remulla said the persons of interest “can be witnesses, they can be suspects.” Dying declaration In an interview with ABS-CBN’s “TV Patrol” on Monday, Marissa quoted her brother as telling her in a text message that the heads of three prison gangs — Sigue-Sigue Sputnik, Happy Go Lucky, and Batang City Jail — gave the order to kill Mabasa. The three in turn received the order from the “office in Bilibid.”  The police and Mabasa’s family believe that Palaña could have identified the mastermind of the killing. Remulla said the text messages by Palaña to Marissa were a “form of a dying declaration.” He said these were “an exception to the hearsay rule when he said ‘pag namatay ako, ilabas nyo ito’ (if I die put this out).” The PNP earlier this week said there were 160 persons of interest in Mabasa’s killing, most of them officials he suspected of corruption, including suspended BuCor Director General Gerald Bantag. Bantag denied any role in the death of the broadcaster-vlogger who aired his commentaries on his “Lapid Fire” program on dwBL radio and his YouTube and Facebook accounts. Info for P1 million According to Bantag, he was criticized by many other bloggers, “but no one has died like that.” Journalist Roy Mabasa, a younger brother of the slain broadcaster, said he had received a call from someone who claimed to be an NBP inmate who had an audio recording of Bantag’s alleged involvement in his brother’s death. The caller said he was willing to give the recording to him for P1 million. When he refused to cough up the money, the man started threatening him and called his niece. The man warned his niece that her uncle, Roy, and her brother, Mark, would be killed next.  Bantag dismissed the allegation, saying the authorities should verify who made the call. “This may be used by drug lords to have me completely removed from my post,” he said. In an earlier interview, he said he rejected a “welcome gift” of P100 million from drug lords serving time at NBP when he took office in exchange for being “friendly” to them. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said he suspected foul play might have been involved in the death of Jun Villamor, one of the alleged middlemen in the killing of radio commentator Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa. In a media briefing on Monday, the PNP chief cast doubts on the sudden demise of Villamor, who was a prisoner at New Bilibid Prison (NBP), saying “it’s an unfortunate incident but the timing is questionable.”   The initial autopsy report did not specify the cause of his death, raising more suspicions among experts and observers, while Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) spokesperson Gabriel Chaclag insisted he died of “cardiac arrest.” Villamor died on Oct. 18, a day after the surrender of Joel Escorial, the confessed gunman in the killing of Mabasa who pointed to a certain Crisanto Villamor as the person who gave him the order to kill the radio commentator for P550,000. BuCor said it did not have Crisanto Villamor on its list of inmates, but later noted that they were certain that Escorial was referring to Jun Villamor. In his extrajudicial confession, Escorial also tagged Christopher Bacoto, an inmate at the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), as well as brothers Edmund and Israel Dimaculangan, and a certain Orly, as his accomplices. “It seemed somewhat incidental, that in the course of the ongoing investigation, suddenly this happened to the one we’ve been looking for, right?” Azurin said. “We were almost there. We have identified the triggerman and we have recovered pieces of evidence and this happened. We could have talked to Villamor,” he added, lamenting that they had expected BuCor to have immediately “segregated” inmates bearing the Villamor surname, so that Escorial could personally identify the middleman. The PNP chief also seemed in disbelief at initial reports that Villamor might have died in his sleep (“bangungot”). “How can you sleep in Bilibid at noontime? When I was a police captain, I had been entering the NBP and I’ve seen the situation there. It’s impossible to fall asleep because it’s too hot and congested there. I wonder how he was able to fall asleep,” he said. Chaclag claimed in an interview with CNN Philippines that they did not initially know that the alleged middleman was an NBP inmate and that they learned the PNP was looking for Villamor only a day after his death.   Chaclag said Villamor might have gotten nervous after seeing the news implicating him in Mabasa’s death while watching TV with other inmates. He said Villamor had heart ailments and suffered chest pain in the past but refused to undergo a medical checkup. Case still unsolved Azurin likewise pointed out that the Mabasa slay case was not yet solved, contrary to Southern Police District director Brig. Gen. Kirby John Kraft’s earlier statement. “Although we have filed a case against Escorial and his accomplices, we have yet to determine who is the mastermind and how it was planned in Bilibid,” he said. Journalist Roy Mabasa said he, too, did not think it was “correct to assume the case (of his brother) has been solved” after police arrested Escorial. “Until we get to the bottom of it, the mastermind, there is no such thing as a closed case,” added the family’s spokesperson, lawyer Bertani Causing. According to Mabasa, he, his nieces, and nephews have also been receiving death threats from a man claiming to be an inmate from NBP since the suspected gunman has been revealed by the PNP. At first, he said the man contacted them via Facebook Messenger to say that he had an audio recording detailing how the suspects and the alleged middlemen inside NBP planned out Mabasa’s ambush on Oct. 4. “Of course, we did not believe him outright but as the family of the victim, we held onto every information we received, so initially I entertained him,” Mabasa said. “Then after a few days, he said he would only provide the audio in exchange for a certain amount.” Mabasa noted that the man told them through a mix of phone calls, video calls, and messages via Messenger that he knew where they all lived, then the man started calling Mabasa’s children “and I don’t know how they got their numbers.”  “He kept telling us, ‘Huwag kayong papakasigurado, baka isunod kayo (Don’t be too complacent, you might be next),’” Mabasa said. Charges readied Meanwhile, Causing said that the Mabasa family intended to file an administrative case against BuCor Director General Gerald Bantag for allowing mobile phones inside NBP which led to the murder of Mabasa. Escorial had said in a press conference on Oct. 18 that the “middlemen” contacted him from the facility to order the shooting of Mabasa, although personnel and inmates in prison facilities are prohibited from using cell phones. As for the criminal charge, the family may file a case over the director’s alleged reckless imprudence resulting in murder, according to Causing. Bantag is under a 90-day preventive suspension to guarantee the impartial investigation of the death of Villamor, as ordered by President Marcos, said Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla. The PNP is also looking into at least 160 personalities, including Bantag, who were frequently targeted by Mabasa in more than 600 posts that it has reviewed since 2021, as persons of interest. “There are more or less 160 different personalities: politicians, military, and police officers. We’re currently looking at their probable link to the death of Percy,” Azurin said. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Should public health officials have a medical degree? Lawmakers differed in the designation of retired Philippine National Police chief Camilo Cascolan as Department of Health (DOH) undersecretary, as the Alliance of Health Workers earlier called his appointment a “huge insult to our health experts.”   Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa on Monday raised the question as he defended Cascolan, his “mistah” (classmate) from the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class of 1986. “If you are appointed to the DOH, do you need to treat patients? It’s not like that,” Dela Rosa, also a former PNP chief who served under former President Rodrigo Duterte, told reporters in a mobile phone interview. “[Cascolan] was not brought [to the DOH] to treat patients. He was designated there to improve the management of the organization,” he said, adding that work in the DOH is “not just about syringes and medical equipment.” “There are many personnel there. So those people have to be managed,” he said. “You don’t need to be a doctor to manage an organization, right?” he argued. “You cannot question his ability when it comes to managing people.” He said there was no law requiring DOH officials to be health professionals. “All you have to do in that position is purely (managerial). What you need is management expertise,” he said. Presidential prerogative Dela Rosa said those who felt slighted by Cascolan’s appointment should understand that it was a presidential prerogative. “Why will they be insulted? It is the prerogative of the President, not the prerogative of those who were insulted.”   Sen. Christopher Go agreed that “as a former PNP chief appointed at the height of the pandemic, [Cascolan] is very much capable.” Go, in a statement, said Cascolan “brings with him the experience, especially in instilling discipline and enforcing health and safety measures against COVID-19.” ‘Surprised’ Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III and Sen. Risa Hontiveros said they were “surprised” at Cascolan’s designation. Hontiveros, whose late husband also belonged to PMA Class 1986, said she would have wanted that the post be given to a public health specialist. “Aside from considering him a friend and my mistah, I respect Cascolan as an officer and a gentleman. His stint at the PNP speaks for itself,” said Hontiveros. But she said the DOH “should and must always be a public health-led agency, especially as we continue to deal with COVID-19 and other burdens of disease.” ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro on Monday asked that the appointment of Cascolan be reconsidered, saying qualified health-care professionals were bypassed for the post. Involved in ‘tokhang’ She asked: “What is Cascolan’s qualification for the health portfolio anyway? Is he going to conduct surveillance on progressive health worker groups or shoot the COVID-19 virus?” Castro also noted that Cascolan as PNP chief was involved in the drug war’s “Oplan Tokhang (knock and plead).” Cascolan was the PNP deputy chief for administration and among those who drafted the PNP’s Oplan Double Barrel that consisted of Oplan High-Value Target where police go after “big fish” drug lords and Oplan Tokhang where police knock on homes to find drug suspects. House Deputy Majority Leader Janette Garin, a former health secretary, on Monday supported Cascolan’s appointment, saying the DOH did not only need doctors but also nonmedical managers.  “We respect the Executive’s decision to appoint a nondoctor in the DOH. Delivery of health services is not just about doctors and scientists working together,” she said. Public health advocate Dr. Tony Leachon, who served as special adviser to the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF), did not raise an issue against Cascolan, saying “I worked with him during my NTF days. He was assertive and organized. Let’s not judge him.” “We have seen the performances of previous military officers in jobs beyond their level of competence. I’m hopeful the new Usec will step up to the plate,” Leachon said on Twitter on Monday. Cascolan was commander of the Administrative Support to COVID-19 Operations Task Force that formulated PNP policy and response to the health crisis, among other tasks. Cascolan started as chief of the special research division of the Philippine Center on Transnational Crime in Camp Crame from 1999 to 2001. He became a security officer to former PNP chief and Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza until 2003. From 2004 to 2008, he was with the PNP Aviation Security Group and served as chief of the 7th Police Civil Aviation Security at Cebu International Airport in Mactan. From 2008 to 2016, he was police chief of Taguig City, PNP provincial director of Compostela Valley, deputy regional director for operations of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao police and deputy regional director for administration for the Western Visayas police. In March 2020, Cascolan briefly served as PNP officer in charge after former PNP chief Archie Gamboa figured in a helicopter crash in Laguna. In February 2021, Duterte appointed him undersecretary in the Office of the President. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A peasant group on Sunday pressed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to quit his post as agriculture secretary and appoint someone suited for the job so they could cope with rising food prices. “We need a full-time, hardworking agriculture secretary who knows how to listen to the situation and demands of farmers and agriculture stakeholders,” said Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) president Danilo Ramos.   Marcos has resisted such calls, saying he was still “needed” at the Department of Agriculture (DA) to institutionalize structural changes. He had also rejected calls to appoint a health secretary as he would rather name one after the COVID-19 pandemic finally winds down. Proposals snubbed The president earlier met with members of the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC) to seek proposals on how to address the food security situation. However, Ramos noted that the president snubbed several proposals from the sector, including a 12-point “Doables in Agriculture” which sought to stop the policy of food import dependency and the conversion of agricultural lands. Ramos lamented how farmers and food producers “were proposing concrete and actionable measures on how to boost local food production, how to genuinely develop the agriculture sector, and protect farmers and consumers alike from inflation shocks” but were being ignored. They discussed, however, plans for the digitalization of agriculture, development of the supply and value chains, and improvement of the agriculture and fisheries sector. Aid to farmers On Sunday, Marcos was in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, where he led the distribution of government assistance to small farmers’ organizations and other sectoral groups. He vowed more government assistance to these sectors as the economy adjusts to external factors affecting the supply of food and other agricultural products. During the ceremony, the DA turned over mock checks to six farmer organizations amounting to P88 million under its Philippine Rural Development Project to help 1,833 farmers in the province engaged in native chicken and goat breeding and marketing, and coffee and virgin coconut oil production and marketing. Additional funds were also released to three farm groups growing corn and coffee and raising native chickens.   Furthermore, the DA distributed free palay seeds to 100 farmer recipients tilling 52,249 hectares throughout the province. The award certificate was received on their behalf by Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson. The Department of Social Welfare and Development, meanwhile, distributed P500,000 worth of assistance to 100 indigent and distressed residents, who will receive P5,000 to P10,000 each. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Citing economic reasons, President Marcos on Thursday said he would name a health secretary once the country’s coronavirus situation “normalizes” from its current state of calamity. Mr. Marcos made his assessment of COVID-19 in the country amid updates by the Department of Health (DOH) this week on XBB and XBC, confirming on Tuesday the presence in the country of these Omicron recombinants and, on Friday, their local transmission.   The World Health Organization (WHO) also confirmed on Friday the presence of XBB in the Philippines and seven other Western Pacific countries, as it urged these nations to continue observing health protocols. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an annual conference by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Marcos said he would not name a health secretary for now because “[w]e have to get away from the emergency, the emergency stance of the DOH, because we have to open up businesses. We have to make the Philippines more hospitable to travelers, both business and tourists.” “[F]or now, I say, we are looking for ways so that we can normalize it and we don’t have to say that the Philippines is still in a state of calamity,” the President said. Proclamations The country remains in “a state of calamity due to the coronavirus,” as declared in 2020 by Mr. Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte in Proclamation No. 929. Duterte extended that edict the following year with Proclamation No. 1218. Mr. Marcos said it was not yet time to lift the state of calamity. “We cannot remove ourselves yet from the way that we are handling it. Because, for example, if I lift the state of calamity, our health workers will not get their benefits that are in the law. We will not be able to import the vaccine, the procurement will be too slow,” he said. But regardless of PN 1218 being still in effect, the country should treat COVID-19 as “no longer … an emergency but something that we will have to manage forever,” the President said. “It’s like flu, like pneumonia. It’s always there but let’s be careful not to get sick. And that is the way that we should be handling Covid,” he added. Asked about another matter, appointing an agriculture secretary, Mr. Marcos said of the post he concurrently occupies: “There are things that the President can do that a secretary cannot, especially because the problems are so difficult that it would take a President to change and turn it around.”   ‘Local cases’ In a forum on COVID-19 on Friday, the DOH noted that while XBB and XBC have been detected in 11 regions, these transmissions were more “localized.” “This means that we cannot link them to either someone with travel history outside of the Philippines or with exposure to someone who recently traveled outside the country,” Dr. Althea de Guzman said, referring to the transmissions as “local cases.” The DOH defines local transmission as cases that are not “epidemiologically linked,” since they are limited to a certain area, whereas community transmission refers to huge clusters of infections whose source cannot be traced. De Guzman, epidemiology bureau director of the DOH, nevertheless emphasized that “our actions have always been [under] the assumption that there’s community transmission.” “[This is] what we’ve been doing when other variants of concern [are] detected,” she said. The DOH on Tuesday confirmed 81 cases of XBB in western Visayas and Davao regions, and 193 cases of XBC also in western Visayas and Davao, as well as in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Calabarzon, Metro Manila, Mimaropa, Central Visayas, Soccsksargen, Caraga and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Soccsksargen recorded the most number of XBC cases at 51 percent, followed by Davao at 36.3 percent. Infections in the other regions ranged between 1 percent and 7 percent. Based on the COVID-19 vaccination dashboard of the DOH as of Wednesday, Soccsksargen had a first booster coverage of only 8.3 percent, while Davao also had a relatively low turnout of 11.8 percent. An estimated 73.4 million have been fully vaccinated so far, with 20.3 million of that figure having availed themselves of first boosters. In its update, the WHO confirmed that, besides the Philippines and Singapore, XBB had been detected in the Western Pacific countries of South Korea, Japan, Cambodia, Brunei, Australia and New Zealand. New variants ‘expected’ Otherwise majority of these countries, including the Philippines, have declining trends in infections, hospitalizations and deaths, the WHO said—as it cited increased vaccination coverage as well as “strengthen[ed] surveillance and health care capacities.”But Dr. Babatunde Olowokure, health security and emergencies director of WHO-Western Pacific, said it was important that these countries “remain vigilant.”  “This [emergence of new variants] is expected. We expect to see variants occurring over time and [will] continue to do so as long as the virus is present,” he said at an online news conference. “[But] continued emergence of subvariants and recombinants poses a risk of resurgence and [of] overwhelming health systems in the region,” Olowokure said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Sandiganbayan’s Third Division has acquitted former Caloocan City Mayor Enrico Echiverri and two of his city officers of graft and falsification of public documents charges over P38.97 million worth of infrastructure projects. Echiverri, former city accountant Edna Centeno and former city budget officer Jesusa Garcia were charged with 13 counts of graft and 13 counts of falsifying public documents for allegedly awarding contracts without the authorization of the city council.   The Office of the Ombudsman, in filing the charges against the accused in 2017, had accused them of causing “undue injury” to the city government by approving in 2012 allegedly irregular contracts for road maintenance and beautification projects. Sufficient authority In a 70-page resolution on Oct. 14, the antigraft court cited a decision by the Commission on Audit en banc which said that Echiverri, as Caloocan mayor, had sufficient authority to transact and approve contracts even without the city council’s authorization. The Sandiganbayan also pointed to the city development council resolution allotting P280.479 million worth of development programs, projects and activities for Caloocan, which could “serve” as Echiverri’s authority to initiate projects from the city’s annual budget. “Simply stated, the award of the subject contracts to the various contractors went through the regular process of public bidding,” read the resolution penned by Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang, also the division chair. Allegations unproven Associate Justices Bernelito Fernandez and Ronald Moreno concurred with the resolution. The antigraft court also stressed that the Ombudsman failed to prove that the certifications made by Centeno and Garcia, in their former capacities in the city, were false since their actions were supported by the local government’s issuances. “In these cases, the court finds that the prosecution has failed to discharge the said burden,” the resolution stated in granting the demurrer by the accused.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Supreme Court will hear on Friday oral arguments on a petition to strike down Republic Act 11935, the law that allows postponing the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections. The SC scheduled the oral arguments for October 21 at 3 p.m., according to the Public Information Office.   Meanwhile, the SC gave the respondent Commission on Elections (Comelec) until 12 noon on Friday to file their comment. Election lawyer Romulo Macalintal filed the petition to overturn RA 11935, arguing that while Congress has the authority to set the term of office of Barangay officials, it does not have the authority to postpone the barangay elections or extend the term of office of barangay officials. Macalintal also urged the SC to issue a temporary restraining order against the implementation of RA 11935. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Lawmakers on Sunday called for an inquiry into the police “gesture” of conducting house visits on some media practitioners reportedly as a show of concern for their safety and well-being. The Philippine National Police leadership has distanced itself from the controversy, saying the national headquarters did not give a direct instruction to do house visits as part of efforts to secure journalists, according to spokesperson Col. Jean Fajardo, adding that PNP chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. has ordered an investigation.   “We want to assure everyone, particularly our media practitioners and their families, that the PNP means no harm,” she added. In a Twitter post on Saturday, John Paul “JP” Soriano of GMA News said an officer in plain clothes showed up at his house unannounced to “check” on his security and asked if he had received any threats recently, considering the assassination of broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa on Oct. 3, and the online threats against broadcast journalists Ed Lingao and Lourd de Veyra. Veteran broadcasters Noel Alamar and David Oro also said policemen showed up at their homes, while dzXL reporter Lourdes Escaros said a PNP officer who was also not in uniform went to the radio station a few days ago looking for her. In a statement on Saturday night, Brig. Gen. Jonnel Estomo, head of the PNP National Capital Region Police Office, confirmed that the house-to-house calls were among efforts by the police to secure journalists. He also apologized to “all our media friends” for that initiative. He has since ordered all police chiefs, down to the stations, to stop the home visits. But Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro want the House of Representatives to look into what they described as an “overkill” by the PNP supposedly on the media’s behalf. Saying the police visits would be traumatic to most people, Abante told radio station dzBB on Sunday that the house visits violated human rights. “Our PNP sometimes engages in overkill. I hope they will make it proper and not make sudden actions. That was alarming,” he said. He pointed out that the PNP could have done prior coordination with journalists they planned to visit.   Castro claimed the police had earlier visited some teachers as a pretext for profiling them. “After [those house visits], red-tagging of teachers worsened. In Masbate, whenever [members of ACT held] a meeting, they [would be] visited by the Army who [would] ask so many questions and try to convince them to leave [the group],” the House deputy minority leader said. “The problem with these supposed ‘visits’ [is that] they are not mere visits because…they are illegally accessing and/or disclosing and/or using personal information,’” Castro said. ‘Contemptible’ Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian on Sunday suggested that, instead of sending cops in plainclothes, the PNP should hold consultative meetings with media groups to avoid any misunderstanding. Gatchalian said it was natural for people to be alarmed when they are visited by cops in their homes for no reason. Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, in a statement, said: “It’s the most stupid idea. I can see the sense in this move of the PNP, but its execution is rather contemptible.” “And the most glaring of all, how could they get hold of very personal and sensitive information such as [the] home address of a journalist?” asked the senator. “Clearly, the PNP violated the Data Privacy Act and someone should be held accountable for this,” Estrada said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Friday rejected calls for the resignation of Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla following his son’s arrest on charges of drug possession early this week, saying the demand was baseless. “You call for somebody to resign if he’s not doing his job or that they have misbehaved in that job,” the President told reporters on the sidelines of a Department of Science and Technology event in Pasay City.   Mr. Marcos said Remulla took the “very proper position” of recusing himself from any involvement in his son’s case. The justice secretary said in a handwritten statement on Thursday that he would “not intervene in nor influence” any case filed against his 38-year-old son. Remulla himself signaled that he would not voluntarily step down and would continue holding his post. “I serve at the pleasure of the President and I think that’s the most important principle,” he told SMNI News Channel on Friday in his first media interview since his son’s arrest. “I see this as a test to our family, to myself and in many ways a test to our country on how we handle a sensitive matter like this,” he said. “I’m the head of the justice department and I will let justice take its course.”Remulla’s son, Juanito Jose Diaz Remulla III, was arrested on Tuesday for alleged possession of over P1 million worth of kush, or high-grade marijuana. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) reported the arrest only two days later without any explanation for the delayed public disclosure that often quickly follows a high-profile drug bust. The PDEA said the arrest was part of a “controlled delivery” operation in which an illegal drug shipment is monitored under supervision by an antinarcotics officer until the owner or the consignee takes possession of it.The justice secretary was then in Geneva, Switzerland, where he defended the bloody drug war of former President Rodrigo Duterte before members of the United Nations Human Rights Council. After the arrest was disclosed on Thursday, calls for Remulla’s resignation immediately came out on social media from people demanding “delicadeza,” or propriety, on the part of the justice secretary, who exercises power and influence over the government prosecutors who will eventually handle his son’s case. “It’s unacceptable to just pen a letter when, as the Justice Secretary, your son commits what has been painted as the most criminal act in the Philippines for the last six (and counting) years. Boying Remulla should resign,” sociologist Athena Charanne Presto said on Twitter.   Mr. Marcos said the justice secretary was “aware that he must allow the processes of the judiciary to work properly and that no one in the Executive should interfere.” The justice secretary also was supported by several lawmakers, including Sen. JV Ejercito. Remulla served as assistant secretary at the Office of the President under then President Joseph Estrada, Ejercito’s father, and later as chief of staff of Sen. Loi Estrada, the former president’s wife. “Knowing Remulla for three decades, I know he will not tolerate this even if it’s his son who is involved,” Ejercito told the Inquirer. ‘Self-evident’ According to Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, the demand for Remulla’s resignation was “uncalled for, unjust and without basis.” Public officials, he said, should “be judged on their own merits, on their work performance and not on what other people (even if related to them) do.” Sen. Imee Marcos said Remulla’s statement on the incident was “self-evident.” “I need not say anything more,” she said. House dangerous drugs committee chair Rep. Robert Ace Barbers said there was no need for Congress to investigate the arrest of Remulla’s son. “I pray for Secretary Remulla and his family, in the same manner that I do offer prayers as well to those other families who are in this predicament,” Barbers said.  The justice secretary’s own political party, the National Unity Party (NUP), of which he is the vice chair, commended Remulla for “promptly assuring authorities” that he won’t intervene for his son. In a statement, the NUP said Remulla’s “professionalism and love of country is unparalleled.” Opposition Rep. Edcel Lagman also said that as long as Remulla was not interfering in the investigation and prosecution of his son, there was no reason for him to step down. ‘Double standard’ “However, the Remulla family must explain why it took almost two days for them to reveal or disclose the capture and detention of the Remulla scion for the alleged importation of P1.3 million worth of kush or hybrid marijuana,” Lagman said. House Deputy Minority Leader Rep. France Castro, said there seemed to be a “certain amount of double standard” in the handling of the drug charge against Remulla’s son compared to the cases filed against ex-Sen. Leila de Lima, who has been detained since February 2017 also on drug charges. “The double standard becomes more glaring if we compare it with the thousands killed in the bogus drug war of the past administration,” Castro said. Like Lagman, she also asked why the arrest of Remulla’s son was made public only two days later. Rumors that the son of a high-ranking official first circulated on social media on Wednesday. Remulla said in his interview with SMNI that he learned about his son’s arrest in the early hours of Tuesday in Geneva, or around noon in Manila. “I woke up before dawn on Tuesday and I was told something happened in the Philippines,” he said.  “I only told one thing to my wife, to get a lawyer since that’s the only way to clear things. That’s the only thing I said,” Remulla said. “I said, get him a lawyer so he can defend himself. That’s a basic right—the right to be presumed innocent, [the right to a] lawyer.” ",0

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has thrown its weight behind the proposal to privatize the Edsa Busway System as a way to upgrade public transportation at one of Metro Manila’s busiest thoroughfares.   Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista, in a recent event, told reporters that the DOTr had instructed the Public-Private Partnership Center of the Philippines to conduct a feasibility study, adding that privatizing the Edsa Busway System could be beneficial to commuters. He said the prospective operator could introduce innovations like an automated fare collection system.   “The private sector, if they involve themselves in a project, they study it well. They are studying how they can be efficient,” he said in a mix of Filipino and English. Impact on pricing Bautista explained that fare pricing could go higher once the private entity takes over as the proponent would have to recoup investments. However, he said that it might not always be the case, as private sector entities would usually find ways to make operations more efficient in order to set competitive pricing. In a recent joint statement, 30 private sector groups called on the government to privatize the mass transport system to aid the commuters. “The EDSA Busway System provides an opportunity for the government to upgrade the country’s public transportation system, despite the challenges posed by severe fiscal constraints brought about by the pandemic,” they said. The groups stressed that the “busway with rapid bus service has proven to be the most cost-effective urban mass transit system in the world.” “It is easy to implement and requires significantly less capital expenditures, while it can provide high efficiency and ridership capacity similar to rail trams with the introduction of the latest technology in commuter transport: high capacity, articulated trackless long bus-trains running on rubber wheels,” they added. Among the signatories were the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce & Industry Inc., Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines, Management Association of the Philippines and Women’s Business Council Philippines.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Education (DepEd) has yet to make a recommendation to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. about the full implementation of in-person classes in November, as it studies the institutionalization of blended learning in basic education. “Right now, we’re currently collating reports from our [regional offices] to know how many schools have the capacity to push through with full face-to-face [classes], blended learning or full distance learning and what are the reasons for their current capacities,” DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa said at a press briefing on Tuesday.   He added that they then would submit a report to Marcos regarding the collected information which could be the basis for the decision on whether to implement the full face-to-face setup. In July, Vice President Sara Duterte, who is also the DepEd secretary, stated that the DepEd would pursue the “five-day in-person classes by November” although recently, she said the directive was still under discussion. The department has acknowledged the challenges of face-to-face education, such as the lack of school buildings. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A local industry association of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) firms and their service providers appealed to the government on Monday to reconsider plans to shut down their operations in the country, warning it would lead to more than 23,000 Filipinos losing their jobs on top of the foregone contributions to the economy amounting to billions of pesos. The Association of Service Providers and POGOs (ASPAP) said their member firms employ a total of 23,118 Filipinos, 11,766 of whom are direct hires and 11,342 indirect ones, on top of the 17,130 foreign nationals who are employed in the gaming sector.   “ASPAP is worried because the impact [will] really affect the lives of many Filipino employees who are now working with our accredited POGOs and service providers,” the group’s spokesperson, lawyer Paul Bongco, said in a press conference in Pasay City. Aside from the 68 service providers, only 16 out of the 35 POGO firms licensed by the state regulator Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) are members of the trade association, according to Bongco, adding that the number of employees to be affected will be much higher than the numbers that they have now. “The recommendation to get rid of POGOs will somehow greatly diminish also the government’s income,” the ASPAP official added. In the last six years, Bongco said that the POGO industry had contributed more than P61 billion to the government in terms of taxes and fees paid to Pagcor, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Department of Labor and Employment, and the Bureau of Immigration. Workers’ fear He added that driving away Pogo firms would also have ripple effects on other industries, particularly the real estate industry. According to ASPAP, they employ a diverse set of employees in various disciplines and different fields of specialization. The group said about 31.4 percent of their Filipino workers served as team leaders or supervisors, administrative assistants, sport-book handlers, kitchen staff, security officers, and finance and accounting assistants. At least 16 percent work as data entry clerks, 10.5 percent as customer service representatives, and 10 percent as housekeepers. The rest are comprised of general office staff, company drivers, payment officers, maintenance staff, dealers or presenters, data processors, and security guards.   According to Nelia Leonardo, a 43-year-old single mother of two, she is afraid of losing her job as a language translator if the government decides to push through with shutting down Pogos in the country. “I’m afraid because it is a good job with good pay. With my income, I have partially paid for a small house and a tricycle,” Leonardo told the Inquirer in Filipino at the sidelines of the press conference. She earns about P35,000 a month, with benefits, including accommodation and free food for her and her sons. Meanwhile, 43-year-old Nasrudin Abdullah, a father of 10 who earns P25,000 a month as a Pogo driver for five years now, laments that he might be forced to go back to seeking work abroad if he ceases being an employee of one of the Pogo firms. “For people like me who had minimal education, there is nowhere else to go for work except in other countries. You cannot get employed by companies here in the Philippines because you lack education. No one will hire you,” he said. Declining revenue According to Pagcor, the overall revenue of Pogos has been declining from P8.021 billion in 2019 to P3.46 billion in 2021. The number of POGO licensees also declined to 37 in 2021 from 53 in 2020 to 37 in 2021, with only 27 still operating by the end of last year. In a statement on Monday, economist and Albay Rep. Joey Salceda reiterated that a total Pogo ban “is burning the house to kill a rat that isn’t even in the house in the first place.” “I see no path forward for a total ban on POGOs without the government impairing contracts or stepping on the rights of legitimate businesses. Those who advocate for a total end to the sector are courting legal disaster. Remember, the Supreme Court affirmed in its most recent decision on Pogo taxes that we can’t just impose unduly burdensome conditions on the sector,” he said. The lawmaker noted that Pogos also contribute around P128 billion in economic activity, which results in even more indirect activity.  “I estimate the indirect employment to be at around 92,000 more Filipinos [who] are also at risk of losing their jobs,” Salceda said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) aims to complete several regional airport projects worth P1 trillion by next year. Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said these ongoing airport projects include the construction and enhancement of Tuguegarao Airport, San Vicente Airport, Tacloban airport, Antique airport, Bacolod-Silay Airport, Catbalogan Airport, Davao International Airport, M’lang Airport, Sanga-Sanga Airport and Ozamiz Airport.   “These projects are all set to be completed by 2023. They have a total projected cost of close to P1 trillion,” he said during an event hosted by the Economic Journalists Association of the Philippines in Pasay City on Monday. According to Bautista, the DOTr has been “addressing the air connectivity needs of Filipinos by increasing airport terminal building capacity and improving airport facilities by applying technology solutions.” The government recently formally opened the new passenger terminal building at Clark International Airport, which could accommodate as many as eight million passengers annually. PPP scheme Bautista underscored the importance of the public-private partnership (PPP) scheme in rolling out major infrastructure programs. Under the scheme, some regional airports are being eyed for upgrading, including those in Bohol, Laguindingan, Bicol, Iloilo, Puerto Princesa, Davao, Bacolod, Kalibo, Busuanga, and Siargao. Four new regional airports in Dumaguete, Siargao, Zamboanga, and Masbate would also be constructed. “We are also looking at modernizing existing major international gateways through ongoing projects such as the P206.96 million airside improvement projects at Bicol International Airport which will see the continuation of the construction of access road, runway strip width, and taxiway drainage system at the country’s newest international airport,” Bautista said. Last month, the Cavite provincial government awarded to the Virata-Yuchengco-led consortium the Sangley Point International Airport project with a projected annual capacity of 25 million passengers initially. There are also plans to build a second runway to further expand capacity to 75 million passengers per year. Construction of the airport is expected to begin next year. Meanwhile, Bautista said they were also “closely monitoring the game-changing New Manila International Airport that is slowly rising in Bulacan,” a project of San Miguel Corp. The Sangley and Bulacan airports are expected to decongest Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway. “While there may be challenges in the completion of these big-ticket projects, the DOTr, CAAP (Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines), and other aviation agencies continuously work toward creating a fully connected Philippine sky,” Bautista said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Saturday marked his first 100 days in office on social media, with various government departments enumerating their achievements since he began his term last June 30. The president’s official social media accounts featured graphics and videos focusing on what his administration has done in various fields, particularly health, livelihood, peace, and education.   In vlogs on Facebook and YouTube, Marcos, alluding to his being a former local executive and the son of a former president, said his familiarity with the job aided him in getting down to business as the head of the government. “Some say that the first 100 days is the honeymoon period [where one] seems to be fumbling about, but it’s not the way I felt, maybe because I’m already familiar with the work, [and] that is why I was able to buckle down quickly,” he said. The president said his “great victory” during his first 100 days is “giving a clear direction and purpose to all the agencies of our government and the Filipino people [and] imparting on all civil servants the quality of public service and cooperation that we need to have in order to achieve the recovery that we are aspiring for.” “With the passage of the 100 days of office, we will continue and intensify our work and service for the country to fulfill your dreams and mine, for our beloved Philippines,” he added. Marcos admitted that he devoted a “long time” looking for the “best and brightest” whom he could appoint to the government. He recently let go of two major Cabinet officials — the executive secretary and the press secretary. Nevertheless, the president said that despite the short amount of time that has gone by to fulfill his administration’s overall plans, “we have laid down, with the help of our diligent bureaucracy, the strong foundations as start of the recovery efforts that we promised.” He said government agencies have “linkages” with one another to ensure that “sufficient attention” would be given to the foundations of what he regarded as the “components of a prosperous society,” namely, health, livelihood, peace, and education. For the health sector, he mentioned, among other things, the issuance of the P1.04-billion special allotment release order for the special risk allowance of healthcare workers, the intensified booster vaccination drive, and enhancing social mobility and economic activity by making the wearing of face masks outdoors voluntary. In the peace process, the president cited the appointment of representatives of rival factions to the Bangsamoro Transition Authority and the continuing of the local integration program for 2,000 former rebels.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos told journalists he would rather be their partner than their leader as he vowed to protect press freedom on Wednesday, three days after his administration recorded its second media killing with the gunshot murder of veteran broadcaster Percival Mabasa on Oct. 3. Speaking at a forum of the Manila Overseas Press Club, the President cited the media’s crucial role in nation building, saying he was committed to upholding the people’s right to free speech and press freedom.   “We will not be your leader but we will be your partner, as we work together to see the full promise of the Filipino nation fulfilled in the days and in the years ahead,” Mr. Marcos said. But the President’s speech did not refer directly to the case of Mabasa, a radio broadcaster and vlogger known as Percy Lapid who had been critical of the Marcos and Duterte administrations. On Monday evening, the 63-year-old journalist was shot twice in the head as he was driving his car near his home in Las Piñas City. Mr. Marcos also did not mention the grim treatment of the independent press during the dictatorship of his late namesake father, when many critical journalists and activists were arrested, tortured and forcibly disappeared. Instead, the Chief Executive pledged his government’s support and protection for the rights of the media “as they efficiently perform their duty.” “Whatever difficulties we may encounter from this point on, the government will always be ready to lend an ear and to listen to your concerns and to answer all that you may want to know,” he added. Help explain to public Mr. Marcos, who evaded interviews with traditional media during the presidential campaign, said he would remain open in communicating his administration’s progress to the press. But he issued a reminder to media practitioners “to not only analyze” and “give their opinion” on the news, but to help the administration “effectively communicate” the government’s efforts and initiatives to the public. “This is another partnership that we must continue to strengthen,” Mr. Marcos said.   While the President didn’t mention Mabasa, Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Hubert Guevara on Tuesday said Mr. Marcos had expressed concern over the journalist’s killing. As of Thursday, authorities have yet to identify any suspect in Mabasa’s murder, although they said they found clues to the gunman’s identity, including a clear image of the masked assailant from closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the crime scene. A forensic team also confirmed that a .45-caliber pistol had been used to kill Mabasa, Southern Police District (SPD) director Col. Kirby John Kraft said on Thursday. The police official said the murder weapon would be cross-matched with firearm records to try to identify the gun’s owner. Clearer angle of gunman The spokesperson of the special investigation task force on the Mabasa case, SPD district director for operations Col. Restituto Arcangel, said investigators reviewing CCTV recordings at the scene had found footage showing a clearer angle of the gunman. “We believe the gunman was riding at the backseat of the motorcycle,” Arcangel said in an interview. “Although he was wearing a face mask, we are able to generally describe his features.” Other CCTV footage from areas where the assailants had passed through also revealed some clues, he said. The dash camera on Mabasa’s vehicle indicated that the suspects were “waiting for him (Mabasa), and it matched the clip showing what happened before he was shot,” Arcangel said. “Retrieved CCTV footage along the route the victim had taken also matched and confirmed the dash cam footage,” he said, adding that this provided clues of where the suspects might have gone after the attack. Mabasa’s family called for the public’s help in identifying the suspects.  On Oct. 4, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos put up a P500,000 bounty for information on Mabasa’s killers. Journalist Roy Mabasa, the victim’s brother, said the family was thankful for the unexpected gesture and called on eyewitnesses to come out. “We believe that good people who will help Percy’s family in solving the killing are still out there,” Roy Mabasa said. According to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, 197 journalists have been killed in the country since 1986. Based on the 2022 Press Freedom Index by the global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, the Philippines ranked 147th among 180 countries surveyed, dropping from the 138th spot in 2021. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The government’s top spook agency must be shookt.   The Department of Education (DepEd) is seeking “intelligence funds” P9 million more than the P141 million sought by the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (Nica) itself. At a hearing on Tuesday by the Senate finance committee on the proposed budgets for the Nica and the National Security Council, Sen. Risa Hontiveros made the comparison as she added her voice to those questioning the P150-million additional funding requested by DepEd, which is now also headed by Vice President Sara Duterte. Such funds are normally used for surveillance activities conducted by the military and the police. Hontiveros said the department should focus instead on institutional reforms to improve basic education in the country, rather than venture into national security concerns. “[DepEd’s] budget prioritization is misplaced. Let’s leave intelligence and security to the pros,” Hontiveros said. “We do not question the legal basis for the provision of confidential funds to civilian agencies like DepEd. But their confidential fund … is higher even than what the state’s intelligence agency [had] asked for,” she added. The committee, however, already approved on Sept. 29 the P710.6-billion budget for DepEd, including the P150 million. Intel also for OVP The panel on Tuesday also approved the intelligence funds for Nica and endorsed for plenary discussion the overall budget of P1.1 billion sought by that agency for other expenditures, including salaries. Duterte earlier defended her department’s request for intelligence funds, saying it needed the money for the surveillance of criminals targeting schoolchildren.   She had also asked for a separate P500 million — this time as intelligence funds for the Office of the Vice President — an item never allotted to that office during the time of her predecessor, Leni Robredo. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, during the committee’s deliberations on DepEd’s budget on Thursday last week, said it would be better to use the P150 million for the repair of schools damaged by Super Typhoon Karding (international name: Noru). Hontiveros said that while she would support any program by DepEd to protect students, it would be best for the department to just coordinate with the police. Otherwise, DepEd would just be duplicating the “existing [functions on] national security, national defense, law enforcement, even [the protection of] women and children [in various] governmental bodies and programs,” the senator said. ‘Serious education crisis’ “National security is not the mandate of DepEd,” Hontiveros said, adding that the department has “no capability or infrastructure to conduct surveillance activities and crime busts.” She cited other areas under DepEd’s mandate where funding is more urgent, such as ensuring the health and safety of teachers and students amid the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening its education program for the indigenous peoples and improving overall literacy in the country. “Let us put funds that would benefit the students. We should empower DepEd to focus on its core mandate of helping teachers and students,” Hontiveros said. “We are facing a serious education crisis. We will lose our focus if we burden an education agency with national security matters,” she added. Guidelines Confidential funds are usually subject to the discretion of the head of the concerned agency. And precisely because they are confidential or discretionary, the Commission on Audit said these expenditures are “difficult” to examine and would thus need accompanying reports for their proper auditing.  In 2015 the commission issued guidelines on the use of those funds which provide, among other things, that they would not be spent on salaries and allowances, procurement of equipment and other such purposes.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Sandiganbayan has dismissed the petition by one of the immigration officers tagged in the “pastillas” bribery scheme questioning the amended charge sheet against them by the Office of the Ombudsman. Immigration officer Er German Robin filed a motion for partial reconsideration last Sept. 17 contesting the decision of state prosecutors to amend the criminal information charging them with graft.   In the amended information, the Office of the Ombudsman has included the aliases in the party names of some of the 50 accused, including Robin’s supposed alias of “10th MAN.” Robin, in his motion, said the alias was not included in the original charge sheet which his camp described as “utterly baseless,” prompting him not to enter a plea during his arraignment last Sept. 9. Robin was among the 50 persons, mostly from the Bureau of Immigration (BI), charged with graft at the Sandiganbayan over the pastillas scam, a scheme that allowed Chinese nationals to enter the country illegally in exchange for P10,000 wrapped like the local delicacy pastillas.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday led the inauguration of a portion of the Metro Manila Subway Project in Pasig City, vowing to pursue more infrastructure projects that will benefit Filipinos. “Let the [groundbreaking] of this subway system signal our intention to the world to pursue even grander dreams and more ambitious endeavors that will bring comfort and progress to our people all over the country,” the president said in his speech at the event held at the Metrowalk Commercial Complex in Pasig City.   “Be assured that this administration will take the lead in identifying, pursuing and implementing projects as part of the Build Better More Infrastructure Agenda that we have laid out,” he added. The ceremony was for the subway’s P17.7-billion Contract Package 104, which covers the construction of the Ortigas and Shaw stations that was given last April to the consortium of Megawide Construction Corp., Tokyu Construction Co. Ltd., and Tobishima Corp. ADVERTISING The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is set to award two more contract packages of the project before the year ends. Transportation Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez said on the sidelines of the groundbreaking ceremony that the signing of Contract Packages (CP) 102 and 103 was expected to be held by the end of this month or the first week of November. CP 102, which was won by Nishimatsu-DMCI Joint Venture, includes the construction of the Quezon Avenue and East Avenue stations. CP 103, which is set to be awarded to Sumitomo Mitsui Construction Corp., covers the works for the Anonas and Katipunan stations. Half a million passengers a day In his speech, the president said he looked forward to the “brighter days” when the Filipino public would be enjoying the project’s benefits. “Although it is a given that the construction of these structures will take time and cause disruption, let us be optimistic and just count these small inconveniences as a small price to pay for the fruitful results that this program, this project will yield,” Marcos said, referring to the six-year closure of portions of Meralco Avenue. The president said that once completed, people would be spared from the perils of commuting while the new infrastructure itself is expected to bring more business opportunities. “As our people gain more time by cutting long hours of travel, they can now engage in more worthwhile and productive endeavors, making time for greater self-improvement or, equally important, spending quality time with their families,” he said.   Joining the president were Senators Grace Poe, JV Ejercito and Mark Villar, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista, Japanese Ambassador Kazuhiko Koshikawa, Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) chief representative Sakamoto Takema, and Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto. The 17-station, 33-kilometer project, which will benefit some 519,000 passengers a day once completed by 2028, is the first underground railway in the Philippines that will connect Valenzuela City to Pasay City. Partial operations It will reduce travel time between Quezon City and the Manila airport from an hour and a half to 35 minutes. The project is being constructed under the Official Development Assistance program of Jica, which will finance 76 percent of the project via a P370.8-billion loan package. The remaining 24 percent, amounting to P117.7 billion, will be paid for by the Philippine government. The idea of building a Metro Manila subway was first proposed in 1973 during the administration of Marcos’ late father and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Sr. In August 2016, the Duterte administration revived the plan for a Metro Manila subway as part of a long-term public transportation network to fight the worsening road congestion. The DOTr targets to partially commence subway operations in 2025. “We are running at full speed on this project. We owe it to the commuting public,” Bautista said during the event. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion on Sunday said the fourth quarter of 2022 will be crucial for the economy as consumer spending is expected to pick up, urging that mobility be maintained to ensure that the country’s economic recovery does not stall. Concepcion said the last three months of the year, which will coincide with the Christmas season, will be particularly important for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and to the Philippine economy in general.   “We need people going out. If people don’t spend, this will affect our economy. How will we attain the growth target that is needed to maintain our credit rating? The last quarter, beginning this October, is crucial for our MSMEs,” Concepcion said in a statement. Concepcion said that a number of external factors, which threaten to weaken consumer spending were beyond the government’s control, implying that other measures have to be implemented to temper the effects. “We cannot control the rising prices and rising interest rates. External factors like the conflict in Russia and Ukraine are now affecting all of us,” Concepcion said. “What we can control is our own willingness to keep businesses active,” he added. Some industries have recently expressed hope that the Christmas season will have a substantial effect on consumer spending, accelerating their recovery from the pandemic. For instance, the local car industry said they expect vehicle sales to pick up toward the end of the year as buyers were generally more willing to spend for high-ticket items during this time. “Normally December or [toward] the end of the year, sales are picking up. We hope that this would continue,” lawyer Rommel Gutierrez, president of the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc., told reporters a few days ago. George Barcelon, president of Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also expressed the same optimism that consumer spending during the Yuletide season will rise, helping local businesses that are still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. “It generally gets better during this time. I think the challenge now is really how to contain [price increases],” Barcelon told the Inquirer earlier this month when sought for comment on prospects toward the end of the year. Concepcion highlighted the importance of continued vigilance against COVID-19, saying caution is particularly important now as schools have returned to holding in-person classes as well as the easing of the face mask rules outdoors.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A total of P544 billion in lump sum appropriations in the proposed budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for 2023 may just end up as pork barrel of lawmakers, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III warned on Sunday. “Budgeting via lump sums does not conform to the spirit and requirements of our budget law and policy,” Pimentel told the Inquirer.   “Lump sum funds lack details. The policy of the law is ‘line item budget,’ meaning ‘as detailed as possible.’ Lump sum [budgeting] is the work of lazy people,” he added. Such budgeting practice, he noted, “lacks transparency. Hence, it is not to be desired.” “What I fear the most is that it could be a rich source of pork barrel funds. That is why DPWH should disaggregate them and publicize the details immediately,” Pimentel said in a separate statement. In 2013, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional the allocation of pork barrel, officially known as Priority Development Assistance Fund, and similar lump sum allotments in the national budget. According to the Senate minority leader, the unspecified allotments were about 75 percent of the DPWH’s proposed budget of P718 billion as stated under the Marcos administration’s P5.3-trillion National Expenditure Program (NEP) for next year. Last week, the House of Representatives concluded its plenary debates on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s first national spending program as it approved the NEP, which would then be transmitted to the Senate as the General Appropriations Bill. “This is no small amount,” Pimentel said. “Every peso in the budget should be disaggregated. Hiding billions of pesos in lump sum funds is nothing new. Let’s shun this practice.” Among the questionable outlay was P214 billion for “convergence and special support programs,” which included P105 billion for Sustainable Infrastructure Projects Alleviating Gap and P52 billion for Basic Infrastructure Program.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Former Manila Mayor Francisco ”Isko Moreno” Domagoso and incumbent Mayor Honey Lacuna are facing plunder and other charges filed by a former opponent in the city’s 2022 mayoral race at the Office of the Ombudsman, over the the no-contact apprehension program (NCAP) in the city. In the 44-page complaint filed on Thursday at the Ombudsman, Alexander Lopez accused Lacuna and her predecessor Domagoso of allegedly committing plunder, graft, “abuse of authority and oppression,” and violating the Government Procurement Reform Act and the Data Privacy Act for the city’s NCAP.   Manila’s NCAP was enacted through a 2020 city ordinance, approved during Lacuna’s term as vice mayor presiding over the city council. Lopez said in his complaint that the NCAP was “carried out or implemented” through the private-public partnership by entering into a contract with QPAX Traffic Systems Inc. for the city’s systems in monitoring traffic violations. Reacting to the complaint, Domagoso said: “I wish him well and good luck.” To date, the temporary restraining order of the Supreme Court on the NCAP implementation is still in effect and its oral arguments are set to be held in December this year. The complaint also alleged that QPAX Traffic Systems was “the one enforcing the law and receiving a percentage share in the penalties of traffic violations,” which Lopez attributed as a violation of the antigraft law. He also said that the idea of QPAX being the “enforcer” of the NCAP in Manila was an “illegal act” and that Lacuna “has not complied” with the procurement law “in publicizing what the contract was about …” “Based on our personal knowledge, there is no publication; Based on our personal knowledge, there is no public bidding; Based on our personal knowledge, there is no publication of the penalties” imposed on violators caught through NCAP, Lopez said in his complaint.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and the Philippine Judges Association (PJA) have joined a group of regional court judges in condemning the outright red-tagging and threats against Manila Regional Trial Court Presiding Judge Marlo Malagar, who junked the government’s proscription petition to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA) as terrorists. The IBP and PJA statements did not mention names, but they were issued following the social media post of Lorraine Badoy, former spokesperson for the government’s anticommunist task force, who called Malagar a “friend” and “true ally” of the insurgents who gave her 135-page decision as a “gift” and “propaganda material.”   The IBP called the statements of “abuse, harassment and outright Red-tagging” against Malagar as “capricious and dishonest” and said that these “foment vitriol and hate against our judges.” “Stating rational reservations on the decisions of the judiciary is normal. Attacking its members and threatening them with bodily harm is not. The judiciary’s job is to decide disputes. And no judge should ever feel threatened just by performing that duty,” the national organization of lawyers said in a statement. It stressed that to threaten members of the judiciary is to sow fear at a “critical element” of the legal system. “Broadcasts and posts showcasing those who verbally assault judges encourages the public to do the same. If judges can be treated disdainfully without consequence, the Rule of Law becomes a hollow promise,” the IBP said. It also called for the immediate activation and utilization of the Judicial Marshall Service recently created by law. The PJA, meanwhile, stressed that “any unfounded assault on a judge in whatever form or manner is an assault on democracy.” A progressive group of faculty and academic workers at the University of the Philippines (UP) who had been targets of Red-tagging themselves also backed Malagar against the threats she received after dismissing the government’s petition to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines terrorist group. “[We] stand with Judge Marlo against the threats of violence against her person and the anticommunist witchhunt from Lorraine Badoy,” the Congress of Teachers/Educators for Nationalism and Democracy (Contend) said in a statement on Monday. Contend said Marlo’s decision was able to contextualize the emergence of communist-led armed struggle “as an organized response to decade-old social injustices and systemic ills.” Instead of “recklessly espousing terroristic aims,” Contend said the decision “critically reads the communist party’s program” as it cited the call for genuine agrarian reform and national industrialization as an “independent foreign policy and pro-people governance that respects peoples’ rights.” ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Changing the “focus” of the fight against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he had told the Philippine National Police that he was “not interested” in small-time drug pushers and instructed officials to put more effort into going after big-time narcotics suppliers and distributors. Marcos said on Friday that he gave the order during a meeting with top PNP officials after he took office on June 30, succeeding Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs is under investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor.   “It is certainly my view that enforcement, which has been the part of the drug war that has been most vigorously pursued by President [Rodrigo] Duterte, only gets you so far. And my approach is slightly different,” Marcos told a forum with the Asia Society on Friday at the close of his six-day US visit. “[During] my first command conference with our policemen, I said we will adjust. Let us adjust our focus … As to the enforcement, to put it very bluntly, I simply told them, ‘Look I’m not interested in the kid who makes P100 a week selling weed.’ That’s not the person that I want you to go after,” he said. “I want you to go after people who, if we get them, if we neutralize them, or put them in jail, we put them away, whatever it is, we will make an actual difference so that the supply of drugs, the system of distribution, the system of importation of drugs because much of it really does come from abroad. That will actually make a difference, it will put a stop to it,” Marcos said. Duterte’s anti-drug campaign has led to thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings whose victims were mostly impoverished suspected drug pushers and users who were gunned down during police anti-drug operations. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency reports that a little over 6,000 people had been killed in the drug war since 2016. Human rights groups say the number was closer to 30,000. Data from the independent monitor Dahas PH, whose members are mostly from the University of the Philippines Third World Studies Program, have shown that Duterte’s drug war consistently targeted small-time pushers, failing in its promise to bring down so-called high-value targets. ‘New war on drugs’ Toward the end of his term, Duterte admitted that he was unable to end the country’s drug problem, which he promised to get rid of in three to six months after taking office in June 2016. He said his self-imposed deadline was just a campaign “hubris,” adding that he was “really wrong” in making the promise. After he won the elections in May, Marcos said Duterte told him to continue the controversial anti-drug campaign. In an interview with vlogger Toni Gonzaga earlier this month, the President said the war on drugs would continue, but it would be waged in a different manner.   He said there were “working groups putting together the new war on drugs.” Marcos emphasized measures for drug prevention and rehabilitation of drug addicts. ‘More sensitive’ The government’s drug rehabilitation program has to be “more sensitive and more sympathetic to those who actually have gotten caught up in this lifestyle … pull them out of that culture and to help them start again and do live a good life as good and contributing members of society,” he said. At the forum in New York, Marcos said: “We cannot stop the drug war. The problem continues to exist. What we can do is to examine and learn lessons from the experience from the past administration.” The president said last week that ICC investigators need not come to the Philippines to look into the alleged crimes against humanity committed by his predecessor and other officials in the drug war. The only way that the ICC investigators would be welcomed into the country would be “if the whole system collapses” or “if we have a war here,” Marcos said. He also said the country would not rejoin the ICC, which it left in March 2019 by withdrawing from the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the tribunal based in The Hague, Netherlands. On ICC probe Marcos said the ICC should not intervene in the country’s domestic affairs. “The alleged crimes were all committed in the Philippines; they were all committed by Filipinos. Why will we need a foreigner to tell us how to deal with it?” he said in an interview with the newly launched ALLTV network of billionaire Manuel Villar. Duterte ordered the withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC after its prosecutor opened in February 2018 a “preliminary examination” of allegations of crimes against humanity committed by the former president in his drug war since his days as mayor of Davao City.  Although the Philippines withdrew its membership from the ICC in March 2018, taking effect one year later, the ICC said it had jurisdiction over the country until March 2019. Under Article 127 of the Rome Statute, a state “shall not be discharged, by reason of its withdrawal, from the obligations arising from this Statute while it was a Party to the Statute, including any financial obligations which may have accrued.” ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Makabayan lawmakers are pushing for a P40-billion funding for the Department of Social Work and Development’s Social Amelioration Program so it can give cash aid directly to poor Filipinos. They proposed a P2,000 cash aid each for 20 million poor Filipinos, or a maximum of P10,000 each for 3.5 million poor families identified by the Philippine Statistics Authority in 2021.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A lawmaker has urged the Department of Trade and Industry and other government agencies to mandate courier services to adopt stricter measures against fake deliveries by online scammers. House dangerous drugs panel chair Rep. Robert Ace Barbers made the call on behalf of Filipinos who had to pay for low value items, which they did not order from online shopping platforms.   In a statement, Barbers called this a form of “online budol-budol” targeting shoppers who pay “cash on delivery” for parcels received. “I have received numerous reports of people victimized by online scammers who steal personal data from targeted victims’ Facebook, Messenger or other social media accounts and use them to deliver bogus goods to victims, some of whom did not even order such goods,” he said. The items are usually of low value and are shipped through legitimate courier services, with the delivery rider collecting payment from the victim. If the package was opened and rejected by the victim, the victim would be required to pay “return to sender” fees, which will benefit the scammer. Barbers said online delivery or courier services should thoroughly check the identity of online sellers. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Filipino workers are confronting the same unjust conditions — low wages amid soaring prices of goods — that stoked civil unrest during the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s late father, labor groups said on Wednesday as they marked the 50th anniversary of Ferdinand Marcos Sr.’s declaration of martial law. Judy Ann Miranda, secretary general of Partido Manggagawa, warned that the downfall of the Marcos regime was triggered in part by troubling economic indicators that drove workers to the streets along with other sectors, culminating in the dictator’s ouster through the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution.   “There was massive discontent by workers during the martial law period over low wages, high prices, insecure jobs, and employer abuse,” she recalled in a statement. Debunking assertions by disinformation channels on social media, she said the declaration of martial law on Sept. 21, 1972, was a period of “labor militancy, and not of golden age” for the working class. “Contrary to the fake news peddled by social media influencers and amplified by a paid army of trolls, martial law was not a time of happiness for Filipinos nor a period of economic prosperity,” Miranda said. Golden age for Marcoses Martial law, according to her, was a “golden age [only] for the Marcoses,” as the family and its cronies plundered the national treasury and took control of debt-financed development projects and key industries. Also on Wednesday, the labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) said working conditions during Marcos Sr.’s regime “are very similar” to the current situation under his son’s two-and-a-half-month-old presidency. KMU chair Elmer Labog cited importation issues and lack of support in the local production of rice, salt and sugar on top of record-high inflation rates, the same economic problems that hounded the country in the 1970s and 1980s. Labog challenged Marcos to address the workers’ demands by certifying as urgent bills on security of tenure and national minimum wage before his 100th day in office, or by Oct. 8. “That has been a long-standing issue ever since your father’s administration,” he noted. Bills establishing a national minimum wage for private sector workers and providing for security of tenure for contractual and job order employees are pending in House committees.   La Tondeña strike As part of the Sept. 21 commemoration, KMU members staged a protest action at La Tondeña Distillery in Tondo, Manila, the site of the historic October 1975 strike, the first major strike held after the martial law declaration. Labog paid tribute to the courage of the La Tondeña strikers who, he said, inspired other workers to stage over 70 subsequent strikes, pushing Marcos Sr. to ban them altogether. KMU secretary general Jerome Adonis said there was no progress for workers’ rights even after 50 years. “As prices continue to inflate, citizens have to line up for rice just to have something to eat, just like times under martial law,” he said. After the declaration of martial law, the Philippine economy experienced growth in the first few years, with the gross domestic product (GDP) reaching a record 8.92 percent in 1973 and 8.81 percent in 1976. Grim numbers But the country also suffered its worst recession during that period, with the GDP shrinking by 7.3 percent in 1984 and 1985. Inflation had been in single digits when Marcos Sr. came to power in 1966. By 1974, it was at 34.2 percent, before returning to manageable levels in the following years. It rose again to 17.5 percent in 1979 and peaked at 50.3 percent in 1984. The country’s foreign debt by the end of Marcos Sr.’s rule had ballooned to $28.26 billion, from $360 million in 1961. The value of the peso also slipped from P3.90 to $1 in 1965 to P19.03 by December 1985. Unemployment stood at 4 percent in 1975, but 10 years later it reached 12.6 percent.  From 1965 to 1985, an official survey showed that poverty incidence rose from 11 percent in 1965 to 18.9 percent in 1985. Based on data from the Martial Law Museum, the daily wage of Filipino farmers declined from 1972 to 1986 by about 30 percent. The wages of skilled workers fell from P127 in 1972 to P35 in 1986, while wages for unskilled workers fell from P89 in 1972 to P23 in 1986. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The silence, though expected, was still deafening. Half a world away in New York City, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had no words to say to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his late father’s declaration of martial law, an occasion of painful, clamorous remembrance for those who survived or lost loved ones to the atrocities and human rights abuses.   Neither did Malacañang release any statement on the president’s behalf, amid Wednesday’s activities recounting the elder Marcos’ military rule, considered one of the darkest chapters of Philippine history marked by tortures, killings, illegal arrests, and media repression. In 2017, then President Rodrigo Duterte, issued Proclamation No. 319, declaring Sept. 21 as a National Day of Protest “in solidarity with the people’s call against all excesses and shortcomings of the government, and with the people’s desire to uphold the highest standards of integrity, efficiency and accountability in government.” But his predecessor’s order elicited no follow-up gesture from Marcos, who was in the United States for a six-day working visit, including an appearance at the 77th United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he delivered a speech on Wednesday (Manila time). ‘Deny the undeniable’ The president may have chosen to stay quiet about the martial law anniversary, but he could never deny the undeniable, according to Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, whose brother Hermon Lagman was considered the first lawyer to be “disappeared,’’ on May 11, 1977, during Marcos Sr.’s regime. In a privilege speech on Wednesday, Lagman said the president’s denials “do not and cannot change the horrors of the past.” “It must be conceded that the president has the right to his own opinion,” he said, “but he does not have a right to his own reality.” “For as long as he persists in denying the undeniable dictatorship of his father, then Marcos Jr. will forever be known as the ‘son of the dictator Marcos!’” Lagman said. Marcos, in an interview aired last week on ALLTV channel, acknowledged “the abuses that occurred” during his father’s martial rule but said these happened “like in any war.” The president claimed he did not resent being referred to as the “son of the late dictator” because “I know they’re wrong.”   “How many times have I been here in this room [in Malacañang] where [my father] was in consultation with different groups? A dictator does not consult. A dictator will just say, ‘Do this whether you like it or not,’” he said. Lagman, however, said such consultations, when performed by a dictator, were nothing more than a “farce.” “When an authoritarian leader with vast powers consults with favored sectors, these stakeholders will merely concur with the despot’s self-serving desires or decisions,” he said. The Human Rights Violations Victims’ Memorial Commission has documented 11,103 people who suffered brutalities during the first Marcos administration from 1972 to 1986. Of this number, 2,326 were killed or forcibly disappeared. Debunking lies In the face of attempts to whitewash the image of the elder Marcos, a group of teachers in Metro Manila has banded together to debunk lies about martial law and to correct false depictions of those years in a rosy light. They intend to do this through forums, webinars, and social media. “The role of teachers — whether in elementary or secondary — is to awaken (the students). Part of our responsibility is to awaken them to (historical) distortion and bad effects of fake news and disinformation,” said Rizza Bantillan, a high school teacher and lead convener of Tanggol Kasaysayan NCR. In the classroom, Bantillan, who previously taught history before teaching values education, said she integrates lessons from the dictatorship in discussions about being truthful and how wrong it is to steal. “When you say ‘don’t steal,’ it does not just simply apply inside the house. You should be able to inculcate (in the students the broader perspective of) looking at the government and who they should vote for,” she said. It was disappointing, she said, that the son of a dictator, a “tax evader” and “plunderer,” had managed to return to power.  “As a teacher, you would question yourself, ‘did I do something (wrong)?’” Bantillan said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) joined the country in marking the 50th anniversary of martial law, which was attended by protests all over the country. In a statement, CHR Executive Director Jacqueline De Guia said the CHR recognizes the sacrifices of many Filipinos of that time, not because they are “stuck” in that period in history, but because of the lessons future generations can learn.   “Even at present, we continue to stress the value of truth and truth-seeking in addressing human rights violations,” De Guia stressed. “We remember, not because we are stuck, but because there are lessons to remember and teach present and future generations,” De Guia said. “We remember so that democracy will endure and, together, we become a better nation.” ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A coalition of education, social welfare, and transportation groups called on the Department of Education (DepEd) to issue clear ventilation guidelines for the conduct of in-person classes on Nov. 2. “We urge the Department of Education to provide detailed guidelines that would enable schools to adopt measures to improve ventilation based on the given class size, room size, and class duration, among others,” Aral Pilipinas said in a joint statement with other groups on Monday.   “By acknowledging that COVID-19 transmission is airborne, corresponding ventilation policies must be put in place since there is a greater risk of transmission indoors compared to outdoors,” they said. Aral Pilipinas cited the Department of Health’s Administrative Order No. 2021-0043, which provides that the airflow in school must be maintained at 1,000 parts per million. The signatories include the groups Advocates of Inclusion, Young People’s Council PH Komyut, Move Metro Manila, Bicycle Friendly Philippines, Move As One Coalition, and Galing Pook Foundation. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Mayor Michael Rama here has tapped the services of two more former national government officials in a bid to achieve his vision of turning Cebu City into a version of Singapore. Rama on Monday introduced former Sen. Franklin Drilon and former Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) secretary Rogelio Singson as part of the Cebu City Advisory Council, the body that is expected to help the city address its serious flooding problem.   “Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are part of the ingredients, essentials, in making a Singapore-like Cebu City,” Rama told Drilon and Singson. Asked if the former government officials would be paid, the mayor said: “They are not asking for anything. They decided to help Cebu City, not because of money, but due to their willingness to assist us. They are my friends.” Rama began talking about a “Singapore-like Cebu” when he started his term as mayor on June 30. He said he would use progressive Singapore to further guide the city in its development. This plan includes paying the city’s debt, realizing the Bus Rapid Transit project, and fixing the perennial problem of traffic, pollution and flooding, among others. Rama also wants to start landscaping projects in idle areas in the city, including center islands and spots under skyways, to allow more green spaces in the city. Willing to help At a press conference, Drilon expressed gratitude to Rama and other city officials. “We will do our best, whether we succeed or not. But if there is something I can guarantee, [that is] our willingness to help. We look forward to being able to see a Singapore-like Cebu City,” said Drilon, who had served as Senate president and justice secretary. Singson, for his part, said the city should push for the construction of medium-rise buildings where informal settlers along the city’s waterways would be relocated. He said the DPWH could help in flood control efforts provided an area was available for them to do proper river embankment.   Singson served as secretary of DPWH under the administration of the late former President Benigno Aquino III. Drilon and Singson were the latest former officials to join the city’s advisory council. The others were former Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu, former Philippine National Police chief Debold Sinas, and retired Armed Forces of the Philippines Gen. Melquiades Feliciano. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Monday indicated that he would support a move by other senators to ban Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) following reports of serious crimes, including killings and abductions, that had victimized POGO workers from China. Zubiri said he was having doubts about whether the small revenue from the POGOs was worth it.   “On a personal note, we must weigh the social costs of POGO vis-a-vis the meager income they give to the national coffers of only P3 billion a year. Plus, they do not employ Filipinos, so there is no added benefit to our local labor force,” he said. Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. also on Monday said he had proposed several “safety nets” to deal with the spike in the number of crimes linked to the industry to Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, a former national police chief and the Senate public order and dangerous drugs committee chair. On Sept. 15, Dela Rosa’s committee opened an investigation of the reported kidnappings and killings of POGO workers. Zubiri said that senators would wait for the report of the committee before deciding on the proposal to ban these Chinese-run online casinos. “So, the question is: Is it worth it? That will be tackled during the presentation of the committee report of Senator Dela Rosa,” Zubiri said. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III has already made up his mind to ban POGOs, saying that allowing them to continue was “dangerous.” “That is akin to harboring would-be criminals and gangsters that can eventually cause massive disruption of peace and order in the country as we are beginning to see now with the spate of kidnapping incidents and other violent activities related to POGOs,” he said. He called on Malacañang to heed calls for a total ban on POGOs as undesirable foreigners were turning the country into a “playground for crimes.” Sen. Imee Marcos, who also is against POGO operations, last week said she brought up the matter with her brother, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., but he has not yet decided on whether POGOs should be kicked out of the country.   She said she was initially in favor of POGOs because the country was making money from them. “That was then. But now, just like the ‘e-sabong,’ its okay as a source of income but it is not commensurate to what we are paying for in terms of the crimes — kidnappings and abductions,” she said. According to the Philippine Amusement ang Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), online gaming began in 2003 and was unregulated. Pagcor started to regulate gaming hubs in 2016. The POGO business started to boom in 2017 under President Rodrigo Duterte, who was then trying to curry favor from China. This was marked by the influx of thousands of Chinese who entered the country legally and illegally to work in POGOs. Last week, authorities closed down a Pogo company in Pampanga province following the arrest of a Chinese national and the rescue of 43 others who claimed they were abducted and forced to work in the gaming company. The PNP said on Sept. 7 that it had recorded 27 kidnapping cases so far this year, 20 of which were POGO-related. Last month, authorities also rescued two Thai POGO workers in Mabalacat, Pampanga. The two were alleged victims of human trafficking. Entry requirements The PNP’s proposed measures to deal with POGO-linked crimes included imposing a requirement that POGO workers must show that there were no pending cases or arrest warrants against them from their home countries. “We really don’t know these people who are entering our country. They might be fleeing their country to hide from justice,” Azurin said. He also proposed monitoring all POGO workers upon their entry into the country.  Azurin said it was important that police and barangay officials knew where these workers were staying to enable authorities to check on whether they were abiding by the laws and ordinances in the country and to “keep track if they are paying the right taxes.” “All government agencies should work together to attract foreign investors and at the same time we do not sacrifice the security of every Filipino,” he added. Pimentel urged congressional leaders to make the POGO ban a legislative priority, saying it was the “moral duty” of Congress. “We can’t afford to dilly-dally on banning POGOs when the nation’s moral fiber and peace and order are on the line,” he said. “We should act now. It will be a bipartisan measure,” he added. He was referring to Senate Bill No. 1281, filed by Sen. Joel Villanueva, which seeks to prohibit the conduct as well as the placing of bets on online gambling platforms. Majority’s call But the burden of passing a measure to ban POGOs were on the Senate majority, Pimentel said. “Get your act together. If you say ‘stop POGO,’ we [in the minority] will support you,’’ Pimentel said, quoting himself as telling majority senators. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate committee on public services, also backed a total ban on POGOs. She cited recent findings of the ongoing inquiry which showed that the “social costs outweigh the economic gains” from POGOs. “If before, this industry was hounded by issues of nonpayment of correct taxes, mass migration and real estate bubble, now it is aggravated by the issues of kidnapping, prostitution, torture and even murder involving POGO workers,” she said.  “It’s like POGO as a mother vice gives birth to a whole slew of other vices and crimes,” she added. Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno last week said the government collected P7.2 billion from Pogos at their peak in 2020, but this dropped to P3.9 billion in the following year. The income from Pogos this year had been projected to reach P32 billion, but only P3 billion has been collected so far, he said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Five “lucky” companies have been cornering billions of pesos worth of “juicy” contracts to supply the Department of Education (DepEd) with computers for several years, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada said on Monday. Estrada, in a statement, said the practice of awarding the supply contracts to a select group of companies flouted the government procurement law, particularly the prohibition against the “splitting of contracts” and “repeat orders.”   “Why are these suppliers so lucky that they almost always win juicy DepEd contracts that run into billions of pesos over the years?” Estrada asked. The splitting of contracts refers to the practice of dividing a procurement project into smaller contracts to avoid the mandated public bidding for transactions worth at least P500,000. According to the senator, he recently got hold of documents showing that Advance Solutions Inc. (ASI), Columbia Technologies, Reddot Imaging Philippines, Techguru Inc., and Girl Teki Inc. secured the bulk of the contracts to supply DepEd with computers. “[S]ome of the suppliers that bagged… [the] contracts to supply Chinese-made computers to the DepEd do not even have websites, and their offices are located in obscure addresses in Manila,” Estrada said. When contacted by the Inquirer, DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa said in a Viber message that the department had no comment on the issue. Senate inquiry pushed The senator, who was indicted for plunder and graft over the P10-billion pork barrel scam in 2014, urged his colleagues to investigate the multibillion-peso computer procurement projects of DepEd. Estrada said he also suspected that the recent controversy over the purchase of P2.4 billion worth of “pricey but outdated” laptops for public school teachers was the handiwork of one of the “lucky” companies, which allegedly lost in the bidding for the deal. DepEd had granted the supply contract for the laptops worth P58,300 each—up from the initial price of P35,046—to the joint venture of LDLA Marketing and Trading Inc., VSTECS (Philippines) Inc., and Sunwest Construction and Development Corp. The Senate blue ribbon committee had already opened an inquiry into the questionable transaction, which was first uncovered by the Commission of Audit (COA).   Estrada noted that while the DepEd’s purchase of laptops had been under “intense inquiry,” its favorite suppliers practically escaped the COA’s monitoring. “For instance, [ASI] and Columbia Technologies have been supplying DepEd for many years and the value of their accumulated contracts amounts to billions [of pesos]. Why were they not scrutinized before?” he asked. “The same with Reddot Imaging, Girl Teki and Techguru. Why are they not the subjects of investigation or audit report of COA before?” he added. Estrada said that DepEd had already bought computers from the suppliers more than once, a practice barred by Republic Act No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act. “[T]he effect of [placing] repeat orders is that it dispenses with or forgoes the conduct of competitive public bidding,” he said. Estrada then warned that this might deter new companies from taking part in the bidding process for government projects. “We should be more welcoming to new players that would make for better competition,” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) is seeking the filing of criminal and administrative charges against two lawyers after the agency lost a case early this year, which resulted in the payment of P205 million in damages to a construction firm. In a Facebook post on Monday, the NIA identified the lawyers as Lloyd Cudal and Mary Annabelle Cruz-Domingo.   “NIA stands to lose the Green Asia Case with colossal amount of P205,958,119.77 due to the officials’ lackadaisical attitude and cavalier handling of the case. Such case could have been avoided if they performed their tasks and duties with devotion, utmost diligence, and good faith,” NIA said in its Facebook post. NIA Administrator Benny Atiporda and Senior Deputy Administrator Eryl Royce Nagtalon also conducted a press conference on the development. In its petition, the NIA asked the Office of the Ombudsman to investigate and file charges against lawyers Lloyd Allain Cudal and Mary Annabelle Cruz-Domingo for gross inexcusable negligence, gross neglect of duty, grave misconduct, and gross ignorance of the law. The NIA claimed both lawyers violated the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and the Code of Conduct of Public Officials and Employees. Cudal is NIA’s acting manager for legal services while Cruz-Domingo handled the case. “We lost the case because of a technicality,” Antiporda told reporters. The case stemmed from the case filed by Green Asia Construction and Development Corp. (GACDC) before the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) against the NIA. In 2016, GACDC bagged a P296.93-million contract to rehabilitate irrigation canals and install steel gates along the 22-kilometer canal from Gapan, Nueva Ecija, to San Ildefonso, Bulacan. The contract, however, was terminated in 2020. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"After netizens cried foul over the zero-budget allocation for the special education (SPED) program next year, the Department of Education (DepEd) said it originally proposed a P532-million SPED budget but it was later scrapped in the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP).   “Despite our earnest efforts to advocate for our learners with special needs, it was not considered in the National Expenditure Program,” the DepEd said in a statement on Monday. The DepEd clarified the issue in response to “malicious and misleading reports that DepEd deliberately excluded funding for the special education program.” Michael Poa, spokesperson for the DepEd, said “internal adjustments” were being made in the available maintenance and other operating expenses of schools to support the SPED program. “According to our finance strand, for [fiscal year] 2021, no amount was allotted for SPED under NEP, but was eventually funded under [the General Appropriations Act] i.e. P329 million,” Poa said in a Viber message to reporters. During the budget hearing before the House committee on appropriations last week, Education Undersecretary Ernesto Gaviola admitted that the DepEd’s programs for special children had no dedicated budget under the 2023 NEP. “We requested P560 million for 2023, but it’s zero budget,” Gaviola said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Ang Probinsyano party-list Rep. Alfred delos Santos has proposed a “Lydia de Vega Act,” which would employ all national athletes and coaches as government employees. Delos Santos’ House Bill No. 4654 aims to make national athletes and coaches regular government employees citing their “dedication to fight for the flag and country in the service [of] our nation.”   “They bring honor, glory, and prestige every time they represent the country in international competitions. Excellence in sports requires not only physical aptitude but more importantly, mental and emotional fortitude. But how can we expect our national athletes to focus on their training if they still must worry if they will be able to financially sustain themselves and their families?” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Philippine Navy’s BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PS-15), one of its biggest and most capable ships, will soon be deployed to the West Philippine Sea for patrols after undergoing system upgrades and repairs of its damaged propeller shaft.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has yet to decide on the fate of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) in the wake of kidnappings and other crimes related to the Chinese-run online gambling activities, his sister, Sen. Imee Marcos, said on Sunday. The senator said the issues concerning POGOs were a “hot topic” when the president celebrated his 65th birthday in Malacañang last week.   “I told him that since the authorities cannot [prevent the crimes caused by POGOs], it’s better to shut them down,” Marcos said in a radio interview. Asked how the president responded to her suggestion, she said: “It seems like he has not made up his mind on this.” ADVERTISING Calls to pull the plug on POGOs, which proliferated during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte, snowballed amid the recent spate of abductions that victimized mostly Chinese nationals. Last week, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos disclosed that many of the kidnappings being investigated by the Philippine National Police involved foreign nationals manning POGOs. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Lawmakers are set to review and scrutinize the proposed P5.268 trillion budget for transparency as the House begins its plenary debates on the 2023 General Appropriations Bill on Tuesday. House majority leader Rep. Manuel Jose Dalipe gave this assurance after the House appropriations committee concluded briefings on the National Expenditure Program (NEP) on Friday.   According to the proposed schedule for the sponsorship and floor deliberations for the budget bill, plenary deliberations will begin on Sept. 20. “The House leadership is confident that the NEP will be adequately reviewed and scrutinized to ensure that the best interest of our people is protected. We will not allow any manipulation by any syndicate or by any group to favor certain groups or individuals,” Dalipe said on Saturday. He added that the lower chamber, led by House Speaker Martin Romualdez, would ensure the “judicious but swift approval” of next year’s national spending plan. “We will scrutinize the budget and ensure the judicious allocation and use of our national budget,” Dalipe said. The House appropriations panel chaired by Rep. Elizaldy Co will submit the proposed budget bill to the plenary, which will deliberate the measure until Sept. 28.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Allowing business process outsourcing (BPO) firms to keep their work-from-home option and tax incentives as long as they register with the Board of Investments (BOI) is a “win-win” compromise. This was how House ways and means panel chair Rep. Joey Salceda welcomed the move of the Fiscal Incentives Review Board chaired by Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno.   The move allows BPO firms to register with the BOI instead of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority. “Cost of living in Metro Manila is among the highest in Asia. If we insist on having BPOs work in Metro Manila, wages will have to go up at the expense of our competitiveness as an investment destination for BPOs,” he said in a statement. “So, the country wins. The worker wins. The government wins. And the BPO sector wins. It’s an elegant solution, and I thank the finance secretary for seeing the wisdom in it,” he added. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"After many years of neglect, the country’s salt industry is finally getting much-needed attention through a P100-million revitalization program to be implemented by the Department of Agriculture (DA). The DA issued on Wednesday the implementing guidelines of the Development of Salt Industry Project (DSIP), which will be carried out until the end of this year and zero in on bolstering local production by using the latest technologies to ensure ample domestic supply.   “Salt has been a very important commodity for thousands of years, and has engraved its part in the economic history of the world. The country needs to increase salt production because salt is a food security issue,” the project document said. “Not being able to produce its own local salt will hurt the country’s competitiveness and ability to become a successful agro-industrial economy. It is clear that to increase local salt production means to increase the salt producing areas,” it added. The country has 36,000 kilometers of shoreline, yet it buys 93 percent of its salt requirements from abroad. Agriculture Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban had noted that the Philippines was not capable of meeting its own salt needs due to the lack of government support. Industry profile Before putting the plan into action, the DA will try to get a clearer picture of the state of the local salt industry, or whatever is left of it. It will begin by profiling, assessing, and shortlisting the existing salt production areas in Ilocos Region, Western Visayas and Zamboanga Peninsula. The National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI), in coordination with the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources’ (BFAR) regional field offices and local government units (LGUs), will then identify and select project sites in the following regions: Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon), Western and Central Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula and Northern Mindanao. The goal is for the DA to come up with a comprehensive profile of salt farmers, producers, traders, distributors, importers and consumers nationwide, and identify areas where efficient salt production can be located. The project will target existing salt farmers and producers, fisherfolk groups seeking to collaborate and adopt the latest technologies to improve the production process, as well as salt producers wanting to revive their operation.   Training The DA will likewise open the DSIP to salt producers who are willing to undergo training on appropriate technologies for product formulation, packaging and labeling. They must be registered under the fisherfolk registry system of the LGU or the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture. Concerned LGUs, in consultation with the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council, will then endorse the potential beneficiaries. Both the BFAR and the NFRDI will select the beneficiaries, who will be given access to the market through linkages with potential buyers (through market matching) and external funding, including grants, credits and investments. Clustering and consolidating the production, processing and marketing activities of salt farmer-beneficiaries will be conducted to maximize the interventions and assistance to be given by the DA under the program. “Individual salt farmers in a community will be formed into a cooperative to avail of opportunities from CDA (Cooperative Development Authority) and other funding agencies,” the project guidelines said. This strategy of consolidation aims to escalate local salt production, facilitate transactions with government financing institutions, increase access to government support programs, and acquire close linkages to suppliers, consumers and marketing services. It will also improve production and manufacturing lines that cannot be undertaken by individual units, especially for small-scale subsistence producers. Technology support The project will also rely on research and capacity building to enhance salt production, processing and packaging technologies. To do so, the NFRDI will concentrate on boosting and sustaining local salt production by providing the necessary production, postharvest and marketing-related assistance to the selected salt farmers and project beneficiaries.  These involve the development and standardization of processing methods, consumers’ acceptability tests, and market research for locally produced sea salt products, as well as revisiting and amending existing policies governing the salt industry. To ensure food safety and product standards, capability-building activities, along with production materials, equipment and facilities, will be provided to improve the handling, processing, storage and distribution of salt products. The project will also cover the improvement of the existing holding or storage facility to keep salt products in a hygienic manner. This way, packed salt products stored in a sanitary and enclosed room will be free from contaminants. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The government must immediately look into the alleged trafficking of persons carried out by syndicates who organize foreign tours to lure their victims, which has led to the recent rise in kidnapping cases in the country, Sen. Grace Poe said on Thursday.  At the hearing of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, Poe urged the Philippine National Police and concerned agencies to ensure “tight coordination” instead of issuing conflicting statements that only confuse the public.     “What is supposedly happening is that tourists who arrive in the country get kidnapped and then sold to syndicates, who, in turn, will purportedly demand the reimbursement of their expenses before they release the victims,” she said.  The committee, chaired by Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, began on Thursday its inquiry into the reported cases of abductions and disappearances in Metro Manila and Luzon. It also started a day after authorities rescued 43 foreigners working in a Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) company in Pampanga.  The committee showed amateur videos of alleged abductions, torture and recovery of cadavers of alleged kidnap victims, mostly by suspects who were “Chinese-looking,” according to the PNP.  A visibly disturbed Dela Rosa cut short the showing of an alleged mauling incident, citing its “gruesomeness.”   Another video from a security camera showed two women, who turned out to be Cambodian and Vietnamese tourists, who jumped out of a building purportedly to escape their “Chinese-looking” captors, according to police.  Poe pressed the PNP’s Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) to explain how it had been dealing with these incidents, whether reported to the agency or not.  “Are you not worried about the possible escalation? How can we expect families of victims to report (to authorities) when we are told that syndicates would usually visit the relatives of their victims who are abroad, whether in Cambodia or Vietnam,” she said, addressing PNP officials.  Tourism impact In a Viber message to the Inquirer, Poe expressed concern over the reported kidnappings.  “The fact that foreign tourists are being kidnapped in the country will have adverse effects on our tourism industry and economy if left unaddressed,” she warned.     “This necessitates a joint effort by the Bureau of Immigration (BI), the [PNP] and the National Bureau of Investigation who should speak with one voice to avoid giving confusing and contradicting data,” Poe said.  These agencies should also have a “reliable coordinating center with a functioning hotline” and a designated spokesperson who will collate all information before issuing any statement, she added.  “We also expect the PNP and the NBI to closely coordinate with their foreign counterparts, including the Interpol, to secure intelligence information on criminal elements masquerading as tourism agents,” the senator said.  Poe also called on the BI to step up its inspection of foreigners entering the country to ensure they are legitimate visitors and not trafficked persons.  Diokno for stopping Pogos The senator said she would call for another Senate inquiry to look into the “social costs” of the country’s hosting of Pogos, following the PNP’s report that 15 of the recorded 29 kidnapping incidents for 2022 were “Pogo-related.”  Also on Thursday, at the hearing of the Senate committee on finance chaired by Sen. Sonny Angara, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno expressed support for calls to end the Pogo program, citing its social cost.  The industry used to be a major contributor to government coffers, but Diokno said total Pogo revenue dropped to P3.9 billion in 2021 from P7.2 billion in 2020.  “In fact, China has discontinued Pogo. Even Cambodia. It also has reputational risk. People will ask why are they going to the Philippines; it is discontinued in China. Why are they going to the Philippines? Maybe because we are loose, we are not strict on our rules,” he said.  ‘Protective agents’ Meanwhile, Dela Rosa said the PNP should also look into reports that licensed “protective agents”—Filipinos who have secured a permit from the PNP’s Supervisory Office for Security and Investigation Agencies (Sosia) to serve as bodyguards of VIPs and foreigners—were being used in the kidnapping of foreigners.  In an interview, Dela Rosa said the PNP may invoke the “doctrine of hot pursuit” to carry out warrantless arrests against such agents.   “My immediate advice is for the Sosia to summon the 35 protective agents under it and determine whether one of them is identified to be in the videos (shown during Thursday’s hearing),” he said.  Senators JV Ejercito and Imee Marcos earlier filed separate resolutions urging Dela Rosa’s committee to conduct an inquiry into the recent wave of kidnappings reported mainly on social media.   ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The so-called “parking” of billions of pesos worth of government projects has been resuscitated in the proposed P5.3-trillion national budget for 2023, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano claimed on Wednesday as he called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s economic managers to look out for a “syndicate” behind the alleged scheme. The budget manipulation was first exposed by then Sen. Panfilo Lacson after allies of then-Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo traded accusations of fiddling with the 2019 spending program.   During the briefing of the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC), Cayetano disclosed that some unscrupulous officials had funneled multibillion-peso infrastructure projects to select congressional districts. He said the questionable changes were made in next year’s budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) under the National Expenditure Program that the DBCC submitted to Congress. Under what he called the “expanded fund parking scheme,” the allotments of at least 10 congressional districts were reduced by as much as 93 percent from their original allocation. In general, parking of funds refers to a scheme of placing the allotments meant for a certain legislative district or department elsewhere before these are transferred to a favored district or projects chosen by legislators. “There’s a group going around telling these (congressional) districts that they could restore the funds, but their favored contractors should be awarded the projects,” Cayetano said at the DBCC hearing. According to him, what is more alarming “is the possibility that the fund manipulation is happening at the source, meaning the DPWH budget, even before it is submitted to Congress.” “If the reports are true, it has become a corruption pandemic,” he added. Cayetano said the supposed members of the syndicate had been talking to district representatives and the DPWH’s district and regional officers. Some districts, he said, saw their funding dwindle from P5 million to just P500,000 without any explanation from the DPWH.   “There are so many red flags. But I have to admit that these red flags were just based on oral testimonies given to me,” Cayetano said at a press briefing. “But there are facts on the ground,” he said. “The DPWH cannot do this alone because you cannot do this without talking to a congressman or a senator.” According to Cayetano, the allocations were commonly intended for flood control projects in far-flung places and other areas that were not usually covered by mainstream media. “I’m really disgusted that this is happening,” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"As various groups prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law next week, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. denied engaging in historical revisionism regarding his father’s strongman rule. The president also defended his late father’s imposition of martial law when in power, saying it was necessary because he was simultaneously fighting communist and separatist rebellions.   Marcos acknowledged “the abuses that occurred” but said they happened “like in any war.” “Martial law was declared because of the two wars we were fighting on two fronts,” he said in a recorded interview aired on Tuesday on the newly launched ALLTV channel, referring to the communist insurgency in the countryside and the Muslim separatist war in Mindanao. The communists, he said, were “fomenting revolution” and “the government had to defend itself.” “Most people do not realize how… close [the rebels] came to Manila and how close they came to large urban centers and slowly gained control,” he added. As for the conflict in the South, Marcos said the separatists were being supported by foreign countries such as Libya, which was the reason why her mother, then first lady Imelda Marcos, went to the North African country to seek Tripoli’s help in brokering peace in Muslim Mindanao. “Those were the dangers and the perils that the country were facing… And that’s why it was necessary to—in my father’s view at the time—to declare martial law because there is really a war,” he said. Whitewashing corruption The president’s remarks are expected to bolster the concerns of critics that he has no intention of distancing himself from the tenure of his father and that this could pose risks to democracy in the Philippines. During the campaign, critics said his presidential bid was an attempt to rewrite history by whitewashing corruption and authoritarianism associated with his father’s 20-year rule. The elder Marcos and his family fled the 1986 uprising against his rule after he had overseen what many historians have described as one of the worst examples of a kleptocracy in Asia.   Marcos Sr. died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, but his family later returned to launch a comeback that culminated in his son’s election victory in May. Decades later, more than 11,000 victims of martial law have received reparations from Philippine authorities paid for using billions of dollars of recovered wealth plundered by Marcos Sr. Bonifacio Ilagan, who was jailed and tortured during martial law, said the late leader stayed in power for 14 years after imposing martial law, dismissing any suggestion it was due to an emergency situation. “Marcos Jr. became president on the wings of false narratives and negative historical revisionism,” Ilagan said. Atrocities, debts Amnesty International placed at over 100,000 the number of people who fell victim to martial law atrocities from 1971 to 1981. Of these, 70,000 were arrested, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed by the military and the police. Under martial law, Marcos dissolved Congress, transferring all powers to the president, enforced a curfew, banner group assemblies, and authorized the military to arrest individuals on charges of conspiring to take over the government. In the 1970s, Marcos took out huge foreign loans that his administration could not repay. The country’s foreign debt had ballooned to $28.26 billion by the end of his rule, from $360 million in 1961. ‘Son of late dictator’ The Marcos family is also believed to have amassed $10 billion in ill-gotten wealth while in power. Asked if he felt hurt when people refer to him as the “son of the late dictator,” Marcos said he had no reason to feel that way. “No, because I know they’re wrong. How many times have I been here in this room [in Malacañang] where he was in consultation with different groups? A dictator does not consult. A dictator will just say, ‘Do this whether you like it or not.’ “How many times have I watched caucuses here, have I watched meetings in this hall? He really spoke to different industries from time to time. [He would] really ask, ‘How can we do this? What do you really want?’” said the President, who was 14 years old when martial law was declared in 1971.  “In fact, I would venture to say in most of the following administrations to my dad. There was less consultation with groups, ordinary people, farmer groups, for example, than in my father’s time. Because I know that everything he did, he did with consultation with whoever. No matter what the system of government was. That’s why for me, you can say what you want, that’s your opinion. You’re wrong,” he said. He said he was no longer hurt by the accusations against his father, adding: “No, it would hurt me if they were right, but they’re wrong. So…” As far as he was concerned, the history of the martial law years may no longer be revised because the facts have already been ascertained. But because “victors write history,” the Marcoses’ side of the story was not taught in schools or presented in the media, he said. “Those reasons [for declaring martial law] were expounded at great length during my father’s time. But of course, the situation got polarized. It’s the opponents who are now writing history, and that’s what happened, that’s why the people learned about it (martial law) that way,” he added. Plan for textbooks “We recognize the problems that happened, the abuses that occurred, like in any war. All of these things are some things that are already part of history,” he said. Whenever he is confronted by accusations of historical revisionism, Mr. Marcos said, he would respond by showing the “many lies” told by his accusers. Regarding his proposal to change how martial law is depicted in history textbooks, he said it would only restore “facts” that critics had supposedly distorted. “Only if they’re wrong [should there be changes]. They’re factual anyway, you can check facts. Let’s talk about facts, not political opinion. What are the things that actually did happen? That we can show, we can prove. Look, we have video, we have photographs, we have records. This actually happened, as opposed to those who say, ‘You know we heard this was how it happened, we have an intelligence [report] saying so.’ These became basically rumors that can’t be proven. All that we say we can prove. That is why, how can it be a revision of history?” he said. “You distort history, maybe, when you say that these are actual facts but the interpretation is the spin,” he said. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The country is allotting its entire sugar production for the current crop year for local consumption to help alleviate the tight supply and stabilize prices in the market. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who as concurrent agriculture secretary chairs the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) board, signed Sugar Order (SO) No. 1 classifying all sugar produced in the country for the crop year 2022-2023 as “B” sugar, or for the domestic sugar market.   The order dated Aug. 26 was posted on the SRA website on Tuesday. Other signatories were Agriculture Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban, SRA Acting Administrator David John Thaddeus Alba and SRA acting board members Ma. Mitzi Mangwag (as millers’ representative) and Pablo Luis Azcona (planters’ representative). This means no locally produced sugar for the current crop year, which began on Sept. 1 and ends on Aug. 31, 2023, has been set aside for export to the United States. “For now, [the] priority is [meeting our] domestic need,” Alba said in a message to the Inquirer. The SRA under the previous management did the same for all sugar produced during crop year 2021-2022, also to manage the country’s limited buffer. Sugar produced domestically is classified as follows: “A” for US quota, “B” for the domestic market, “C” for reserve, and “D” for the world market. Importation plan Tight supply and declining production have pushed sugar prices higher this year. As of Tuesday, the Department of Agriculture’s price monitoring showed that refined sugar in Metro Manila markets retailed for P95 a kilo, or nearly double from only P50 a year ago, while brown sugar was being sold for P70 a kilo, also up from P42. For the crop year 2022-2023, the SRA estimated the total raw sugar production at 1.88 million metric tons (MT). On the other hand, sugar demand for the past three crop years has been around 2.03 million MT. “As one of the (SRA) board’s actions to address the tightness of our sugar supply, [it] has already passed an importation program which will serve both industrial users and consumers,” Alba said.   The planned importation, he explained, was “just a stop-gap measure” since all refineries would go into full operation by October or November, at the latest. “Some sugar mills have already started milling and we will soon have a steady supply of sugar,” he added. The runaway prices of the commodity eventually led to the sugar importation fiasco. That controversy arose when the previous SRA board issued SO 4 allowing the importation of 300,000 MT of sugar. Malacañang immediately rejected the order since the president did not authorize it. After the investigations launched in Congress, the Senate blue ribbon committee recommended to the Ombudsman the filing of criminal and administrative charges against former Agriculture Undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian, former SRA administrator Hermenegildo Serafica, and resigned board members Roland Beltran and Aurelio Valderrama Jr. for alleged corrupt practices, violation of the anti-agricultural smuggling law and usurpation of authority. Minority report While the committee cleared Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez, the minority senators said the Palace official was not “totally blameless” as he could be made liable for the lapses he committed that had whipped up the fiasco. In their 17-page report, Senators Aquilino Pimentel III and Risa Hontiveros also disputed the committee’s recommendation to file graft and administrative charges against the four agriculture officials involved. They issued their report a day after committee chair Sen. Francis Tolentino submitted to the plenary for ratification the panel’s findings. The minority senators said the four officials acted in good faith in issuing SO 4. ‘Miscommunication’ “Contrary to the insinuations made, and as aptly explained in the hearings, the 300,000 (MT) figure mentioned in SO 4 did not come from thin air but is based on facts, historical data, and a result of consultation with stakeholders,” the report read. It zeroed in on the “miscommunication” between Rodriguez and Sebastian, who was supposedly following up with the former the status of SO 4.  The report noted how Rodriguez himself admitted in his testimony that he purposely did not reply to Sebastian’s text messages because the President, too, had not given any reply on this. It pointed out that Rodriguez, as Executive Secretary, had a direct link and stood as the gatekeeper to the President. “There would not have been any miscommunication had the executive secretary simply replied that the SRA Board should give the President more time to study the draft (SO 4) and to hold in abeyance the planned referendum pending advice or instruction from the Office of the President,” it said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The House ways and means panel will consider proposals to increase excise rates on so-called “sin products” like alcohol, sweetened beverages, cigarettes, and vape products. However, House ways and means committee chair Rep. Joey Salceda said lawmakers were not inclined to impose higher taxes on junk food, and are leaning toward regulation, not taxation.   “We will definitely consider the proposals for higher taxes on sweetened beverages. It might help reduce overall sugar demand and help us manage the supply deficit and reduce the need to import,” Salceda said. In a statement, he said the panel will “study the impact” as revenue collection has “flatlined to the P32 to P35 billion per year mark.” “We want to see whether it will really have an impact on obesity,” Salceda added. The House official made the remarks after the Department of Health (DOH) proposed an increase in excise on sweetened beverages, junk food, and “nonstaple” that are high in salt and fat. Obesity Maria Rosario Vergeire, officer in charge of the DOH, said this was part of the DOH’s strategy to regulate the “sustained increase” in lifestyle-related risk factors like obesity. For its 2022 budget, 59 percent or P155 billion of the agency’s funding came from revenue collections under Republic Act No. 10351, or the Sin Tax Reform Act of 2012. Salceda said the House ways and means panel would “seriously study” the DOH’s proposals. “Definitely, my office will pursue more regulation, taxation aside. Definitely, we are going for a ban on sugary drinks in public and private grade schools,” he said. He said the panel is also open to higher excise taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and vape products.   “We will definitely consider the proposals. In fact, I am already preparing a bill on higher taxes on vape products, especially now that global jurisprudence already acknowledges the harm in vaping,” Salceda said. ‘Vaping has harms’ He was referring to a $438.5-million tentative agreement on a multistate settlement with JUUL Labs, a vape product manufacturer. “It is now acknowledged in courts abroad that vaping has harms. So, there is an impetus to further discourage consumption there,” the lawmaker said. He added that he has already formed a study group with civil society and government agencies to study cigarette and alcohol taxation levels and “craft ideal rates and taxation design.” “We will consider all proposals, and all counter-arguments, including illicit trade, jobs losses, inflationary impact, as well as what works in other countries. In principle, the committee believes in health taxes, especially to fund universal health care,” Salceda said. But as to a “junk food” tax, the economist turned lawmaker said the panel was leaning “toward regulation rather than taxation” although it would still study the proposal. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Chinese Embassy in Manila said on Monday that it had requested Philippine authorities to intensify efforts to protect its nationals amid a recent spate of kidnappings involving Chinese victims. “We immediately checked and verified the specific cases, held discussions with the [Chinese-Filipino] communities, and lodged representations with the Philippine law enforcement authorities, requesting the Philippine side… to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the country,” it said in a statement sent to the Inquirer.   The embassy noted that in recent years, there had been frequent cases of “kidnapping, blackmailing, illegal detention, and other vicious cases” targeting its nationals due to online gaming and telecommunications fraud. It urged Philippine agencies to “strengthen our law enforcement cooperation and their crackdown on kidnapping, blackmailing, illegal detention, and other criminal acts” that endanger its nationals. But at the same time, it also reminded its citizens to “firmly establish legal awareness, keep away from immoral activities, stay away from online gambling and telecommunications fraud, and avoid falling into gambling-related blackmailing and injury cases.” At the Senate, a hearing was set on Sept. 15 on the “kidnapping wave” that had reportedly victimized dozens, including Chinese and Filipinos, and the spread of disturbing videos showing supposed victims being tortured by their captors, some of whom appeared to be foreigners. “We want the Philippine National Police to shed light on the videos circulating and the reports coming from sources so that we will know if these are true or not,” Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, Senate public order and dangerous drugs committee chair and a former PNP chief, told reporters. Conflicting statistics Senators Grace Poe and JV Ejercito had pushed for the inquiry in separate resolutions as they also called on the PNP to stop the spate of abductions. Both noted that the police had so far presented conflicting statistics about the number of cases, which Poe said only caused “undue and unnecessary anxiety and fear [in] our countrymen.” She observed that while PNP chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. had tried to downplay the string of kidnappings, there were many reports and videos of such incidents on mainstream and social media. “(This) kidnapping wave is creating a state of fear, anxiety and vulnerability among Filipinos,” Poe said in Senate Resolution No. 195. “There is an urgent need to determine the status of these cases, possible motives, agency efforts to identify the perpetrators and the measures instituted by relevant authorities to prevent the continuous rise of abduction in the country,” she added.   Ejercito said he was particularly disturbed by the proliferation of video clips on various messaging apps and social media platforms showing people, believed to be kidnap victims, being tortured. One showed a blindfolded man whose left ear was severed by one of his captors as two other persons held him down. According to Ejercito, another showed several men hitting with a hammer their bloodied victim, all of them “Chinese-looking,” as they engaged in “Chinese-sounding” conversation. “While we still don’t know if these videos were real or just a hoax, or if these really happened in the country recently, we need to check [their] veracity…,” he said. “The government should act swiftly to put an end to this spate of kidnappings and killings, take control of the situation and guarantee our people of their safety and provide an assurance of a peaceful community,” Ejercito said in Senate Resolution No. 194. Test for gov’t He added that it would be better if President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself would issue a statement directing the police to solve the kidnappings as he surmised that criminal syndicates may be “testing the waters.” “Every time there’s a new administration, (criminal groups) test the leadership. They are testing (the Marcos) administration and the new PNP leadership,” Ejercito said. Azurin, meanwhile, continued to deny the supposed kidnappings of Chinese-Filipino nationals in Metro Manila although he said he had deployed more policemen near Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogo) establishments in the capital region amid an increasing number of abducted Pogo workers. “We saw the need to beef up police presence in entertainment areas, specifically in Parañaque, Pasay and Makati,” he told reporters on Monday. PNP data showed that out of 27 kidnapping cases from January to September this year, 15 were Pogo-related, slightly higher from the 12 recorded in the same period in 2021. Azurin said it was a challenge to identify foreign nationals in Pogo companies, as well as legitimate operators, because of lack of records.  “We really need to engage our immigration [bureau] so we would know who are the Chinese nationals coming to our country,” he said, adding that the information would make it easier for the PNP to investigate such cases. Azurin also said that members of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. had told him that “the [recent] reported kidnappings are not true.” “We are really very fortunate because they have volunteered to help us and to report to us any information regarding any crime incident that they know about. As I’ve said, there are no crimes that are reported to us that we have not acted on,” he said. As for the supposed abduction videos, Azurin said these were old incidents that were being released on social media to make it seem they happened recently. “I really don’t know their intent in releasing those videos because if they think they are hurting the PNP in posting them, they are … [also hurting] the economy,” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Senate will augment the budget of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), whose funding was slashed by P893 million in the government’s proposed spending program for 2023 despite the continuing pandemic, Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara said on Sunday. Angara, chair of the Senate finance committee, said the chamber would start the Development Budget Coordination Committee hearings and the deliberations on the proposed P5.3-trillion National Expenditure Program this week.   He said they would try to conclude the committee hearings in October and pass the expenditure bill in late November in time for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s signing of his administration’s first national budget before the year ends. “We hope to continue strengthening the health sector and health system, particularly PGH,” Angara said, noting that lawmakers had been improving the proposed funding of the executive branch for the state-owned hospital. “In recent years Congress has augmented its budget. I won’t be surprised if we do it again,” he told the Inquirer when asked if senators would restore the PGH’s budget cut. Regarded as the country’s premier public hospital catering to indigent Filipinos, the PGH was allotted P5.412 billion for next year, P893 million lower than its current budget of P6.302 billion. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Two House lawmakers are seeking the abolition of two agencies, including the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), and an office of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) supposedly in line with government efforts at rightsizing the bureaucracy. Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez filed House Bills No. 4197 and 4204, the first for the abolition of the Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) and the other to get rid of the Procurement Service of the DBM (PS-DBM), which he maintained were “redundant and irrelevant in these current times.”   Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante has filed House Bill No. 4331 at the House of Representatives to abolish the PCGG, an agency created 36 years ago to go after the ill-gotten wealth of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and his cronies. In May 2018 the House approved on final reading House bill No. 7376, which sought to abolish the PCGG and the Office of the Government Counsel. A Senate bill in 2019, however, rejected the abolition of the agencies. ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Two former Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) board members were misled into signing an importation order for 300,000 metric tons of sugar without the approval of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who is also agriculture secretary, according to Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri. “They were misled to believe that the president wanted it,” said Zubiri, who was in Bacolod on Friday for the groundbreaking of Bacolod City General Hospital.   He was referring to former SRA board members Roland Beltran and Aurelio Gerardo “Bodie” Valderrama Jr. “There is only one mastermind if you ask me,” the Senate president said, adding that he would ask the blue ribbon committee, led by Sen. Francis Tolentino, to amend its report to reflect this belief. The committee released the report on its investigation on Thursday and recommended the filing of charges against Agriculture Undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian, former SRA Administrator Hermenegildo Serafica, Beltran, and Valderrama for the issuance of Sugar Order No. 4. The committee urged the Ombudsman to file charges of corruption, violation of Republic Act No. 10845, or the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Law, and usurpation of authority against the four officials. Lookout bulletin The committee also asked the Bureau of Immigration to include Sebastian, Serafica, Beltran, and Valderrama in the agency’s lookout bulletin. But Valderrama said he was asked by Serafica to sign SO 4 on Aug. 9. “He (Serafica) told me the President needed it,” Valderrama said and since the president asked for an importation plan in a meeting on Aug. 4, Valderrama was no longer surprised when Serafica asked him to sign the document. Valderrama said he was the first to sign the document after he consulted with sugar planters and he could not have known that Sebastian would later sign the document on behalf of the president. Beltran, for his part, said he resigned from the SRA Board on July 1 for health reasons and only signed the document as a board member because he was told to stay in a holdover capacity.   Another official embroiled in the scandal was Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez, who was blamed for SO 4, although he did not sign the document and the four board members admitted he never told them to sign the document or that Marcos approved of the importation. In the Senate blue ribbon hearing on Sept. 6, Rodriguez was cleared of any liability. Among the committee recommendations were the amendment of Republic Act No. 10659, or the Sugarcane Industry Development Act of 2015, to inject transparency and accountability in issuing import permits and the replacement of Executive Order No. 18, signed in 1986.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Grace Poe on Saturday said she wants the Senate to conduct an investigation into the reported incidents of kidnapping in the country. Poe said she will file a resolution urging the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs and other appropriate committees to conduct an inquiry into the reported kidnapping incidents that happened in Metro Manila and in other parts of Luzon.   In a draft copy of the resolution released to the media, Poe said “another kidnapping wave is creating a state of fear, anxiety and  vulnerability among Filipinos.” The resolution cited the revelation of Lugene Ang, the president of the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc. that there have been 56 kidnapping incidents in the country “for the last 10 days” since September 6. However, the Philippine National Police has countered Ang’s claim, saying there were only 27 kidnapping cases reported to them so far this year. It also mentioned the kidnap-slay of pharmaceutical executive Eduardo Tolosa Jr., who was the CEO of Iraseth Pharma Inc. “We cannot allow this situation to threaten our people’s safety and trample on our efforts to help them get through the difficult times,” Poe said in her resolution.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. will be the first Philippine president to speak at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) since then President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III did so in 2010. Marcos will be addressing the 77th UNGA here on Tuesday, September 20. He will be the second speaker of the afternoon session at 3:15 p.m. (New York time), following Honduras.   President Marcos will also be the first leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to deliver a statement at the High-Level General Debate. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Marcos will discuss his administration’s priorities, such as climate change, the rule of law, and food security. Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said Marcos’ speech at the UNGA will focus on the administration’s priority objective, which is to atttain economic recovery. “His intent for the administration is for economic recovery. Therefore, his activities are always pursuant to that. His speech will be in pursuit of that,” she said Thursday, September 15.   Around 152 other heads of state and government will participate in the High-Level General Debate. The theme of this year’s General Debate is: “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges.” The UN said among these challenges are the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, humanitarian challenges of unprecedented nature, a tipping point in climate change, and threats to the global economy. The late President Benigno Aquino III was the last Philippine president to address the UNGA in person. In his speech in 2010, Aquino noted that the problem of one country posed a problem to another, so solutions could not be developed in a vacuum. “For humanity to progress, all nations must progress as one,” he said. Aquino likewise called for support for the countries most vulnerable to climate change in building climate-resilient communities, reconstruction, and disaster risk-reduction. He also asked major economies to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The former President Rodrigo Duterte, meanwhile, delivered a speech at the UNGA virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Duterte received praise even from critics because he raised the Philippines’ stand on the South China Sea issue.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said on Saturday, Sept. 17 that his minority bloc would support any proposed legislation by the majority bloc outlawing the operation of the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) as foreign gangsters have converted the Philippines into their ‘’gambling playground”.   Pimentel said a congressional initiative to outlaw POGO operations is the desirable step rather than wait for a Malacañang’s decision, which might not come and would only put the minority bloc in a passive position. ‘’You are the majority. Get your act together. If you say ‘stop POGO’, we will support you,’’ Pimentel said during a DWIZ radio interview this afternoon.   The alleged criminal elements linked with POGO operations have reportedly been behind a series of criminal activities such as prostitution, violent acts and kidnapping for ransom, usually against their own countrymen. ‘’Deport them,’’ Pimentel, a former Senate President, said. In last Thursday’s Senate Public Order and Dangerous Drugs Committee hearing, Senator Joseph Victor ‘JV’ Ejercito revealed that Chinese travellers have come into the country using the identifies of dead Filipinos. As the Covid-19 pandemic is dying down, Bureau of Immigration (BI) officials testified that they only resumed recently subjecting foreigners to biometrics. In a Commission on Appointments (CA) public hearing last Wednesday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla revealed that there are now 800,000 illegal aliens in the country and that this is a problem that should be resolved head on. Pimentel, a bar topnotcher, suggested that the national government declare as a national policy against online gambling because POGO operations are allowed by law.   ‘’Repeal the law [allowing online gaming] and declare a policy’’ that POGO operations are illegal, he added. Pimentel said he is fully convinced that POGO operations has had a “negative effect” to the country. He said the legal operation of POGO allowed the gangsters from abroad to come into the country. Pimentel lamented that the Philippines has its own crime problem where the Philippine National Police (PNP) ‘’cannot solve’’ and has no police visibility ‘’and now there are (undesirable) foreigners”. He said foreigners are allowed into the country only when the work requires highly technical jobs where no Filipino could do the job. He said POGOs are a ‘’marketing and Internet’’ enterprise that could be done by Filipinos. POGO is considered illegal in China. POGO operations in the Philippines are being handled by mainland Chinese businessmen.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Before leaving the country, Marcos said it is important for the Philippines to participate actively in the UNGA “to make certain that our voice is heard.”   “The UN is where the countries of the world congregate to discuss the most pressing challenges facing our people. Thus, it is important for us to participate in the General Assembly and to make certain that our voice is heard,” he said in his departure speech. The President is expected to deliver the national statement on Sept. 20 to articulate the country’s expectations of the United Nations, the role the country will play and its contributions to strengthening the international system. He said he will share the Philippines’ vision in people-centered development, highlighting his administration’s goal for economic recovery, food security, and agricultural productivity. He also intends to affirm the country’s commitment to the ideals of the UN, citing its contributions to peaceful settlement of disputes and of international law.   More partnerships Aside from addressing the UNGA, the Chief Executive will deliver key messages in several economic briefings during his working visit to New York in order to expand and strengthen the Philippine-US trade and investment relations and attract potential US investors and partners. “I will also participate in business activities to forge more partnerships to advance our national economic and sustainable development in general,” Marcos said. “I will be joined in these meetings by key private sector representatives who have been and will continue to be our partners in this endeavor. More vibrant PPPs (Public Private Partnerships) will allow us to achieve the better normal that we all aspire for,” he added. He is also expected to meet with UN Secretary General António Guterres and other world leaders, including the country’s long-standing allies to discuss opportunities for stronger cooperation in food security, agriculture, renewable energy, and climate change, which, he said, are among the key priorities of his administration. The President said he will also take time to meet with the Filipino community there, some will be coming from Canada.   “And of course, I will be visiting with the Filipino community there. I am told our kababayans as far as from Canada will participate in this gathering,” he said. “It will be my chance to thank (them) for their support, affirm their important role in the continuing work of nation-building and strengthen our cooperation on matters that redound to the benefit of Filipinos here at home and abroad,” he added. More than 150 heads of state and government will be participating in this year’s High-Level General Debate, the first to be held completely in person since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. This is also the first time Marcos will set foot in the US after not being able to visit the country for years due to a court’s contempt order issued against him. Now, that he is the President, he has “diplomatic immunity” to travel to the US. Marcos was sent off by high-ranking officials including Vice President Sara Duterte and his chief legal counsel Juan Ponce Enrile at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Sunday morning.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III has lauded the President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s decision to transfer the supervision of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).   Pimentel described the President’s decision, through Executive Order No. 5, as a “brilliant move.” “It’s a brilliant move. I am in full support of the President’s decision to let DOLE supervise TESDA,” Pimentel said in a statement on Saturday.   “It is crucial for these two agencies to work together to address joblessness and productivity. Unemployment remains to be one of the biggest challenges that the Marcos administration should be able to address,” Pimentel added. Pimentel has repeatedly expressed concern over the increasing number of unemployed Filipinos which is already at 2.99 million in July. He said there is a need to synchronize efforts to address unemployment with DOLE and TESDA as the lead agencies.   “Hence, EO No. 5 augurs well in the efforts to address joblessness in the country,” Pimentel stressed. Under Marcos’ Executive Order No. 5, the DOLE secretary shall also serve as the chairperson of the TESDA board. In line with this, Pimentel said he hopes Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma to review TESDA’s proposed spending outlay for 2023 before the Senate tackles their budget proposal “to ensure that their policies are in sync with the end view of providing more job opportunities to the Filipino people.” According to the EO, the move to let DOLE supervise TESDA is part of the national government’s decision to rationalize the functional structures of agencies with complementary mandates and promote coordination, efficiency, and organizational coherence in the bureaucracy.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda has filed Senate Bill (SB) 247, or the ‘’One Town, One Product Phlippines (OTOP) Program Act of 2022″.   She filed a similar measure during her recent term as Antique congresswoman in the House of Representatives. Legarda explained that the OTOP promotes local products from a sector and a locality. A press statement issued by Legarda’s office stated that the four-term senator is known for her deep appreciation and respect for locally-produced products. ‘’She sees the immense value of these, the creativity of the different localities producing them, and the special role of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs),’’ it added.   Legarda said the MSMEs should be supported financially and in terms of capacity-building because they are the lifeblood of our economy, especially during this health crisis. She pointed out that the program should capacitate the MSMEs on product development, initiatives, and training, among others, to upgrade our MSMEs. ‘’It also seeks to create the OTOP Management Committee within the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the OTOP Program Office in each local government unit to help achieve the objectives of the law,” she explained. The OTOP Program shall assist in product development, packaging and labeling, technology updating, capacity building, standards and market compliance, and market access and product promotion. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) shall serve as the lead agency for the measures implementation.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Sherwin Gatchalian is pushing for increased adoption of remote working arrangements anew in a bid to ease worsening traffic congestion in Metro Manila.   The program, if adopted by a significant number of employers, could form part of solutions to address the perennial problem of traffic bottlenecks in metropolitan areas, Gatchalian said. He cited recent research by insurance technology site GoShorty that showed Filipinos spent about 98 hours or more than four days trapped in Metro Manila’s traffic jams every year. To encourage companies to implement work-from-home (WFH) arrangements or telecommuting, the government should provide tax incentives for those that will adopt the program, according to Gatchalian. “We want to incentivize those who opt-in to this program because of the great benefits it will have on our people,” he said.   Under Senate Bill (SB) 1149, employees shall be entitled to a deduction of P25 from their taxable income for every hour of service rendered under a WFH or telecommuting arrangement. Also, allowances or other benefits not exceeding P2,000 per month provided by employers to their employees to cover expenses necessary for WFH or telecommuting arrangements shall be considered a non-taxable benefit. “The work-from-home revolution, which has been accelerated by the pandemic, has numerous advantages that benefit not just the workers concerned. A major benefit of this program is that it will ease traffic congestion especially as in-person classes resume and many businesses are now in full operation,” Gatchalian said. Aside from reducing traffic congestion, remote working arrangements would also cut fuel demand as well as enhance employee productivity as evidenced by various studies, he pointed out.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"SAGIP Party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta and Albay 1st district Rep. Edcel Lagman had a friendly debate about linguistics on Friday, Sept. 16 at the House of Representatives, with “red-tagging” being the main topic. During his interpellation of the proposed 2023 budget of the National Commission on Indigenous People (NCIP), Marcoleta contended that the budget of an important agency, such as the NCiP, shouldn’t get deferred on the basis of a word that wasn’t in the dictionary. Friday was actually the second go-round of the NCIP budget before House members; last Sept. 7, the Committee on Appropriations, through the motion of Makabayan solon, Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, deferred the tackling of the agency’s budget due to alleged red-tagging by its chairman, Allen Capuyan. “Did you bother to look into the English dictionary if there is a word, ‘red-tagging’? Or ‘red tag’?” Marcoleta asked Capuyan. “There’s no such…wala po kaming na-encounter na salitang red-tagging (we didn’t encounter the word red-tagging),” Capuyan answered.   Marcoleta said, “Mayroon po akong nakita, red panda, red tide, red wine. Maski po yung dictionary natin dito sa library na napakakapal, hindi ko po nakita yung red tag eh (I saw the phrases red panda, red tide, red wine. But even in our library here which has a very thick library, I didn’t see red tag). “Kaya ako po ay nagtataka kung bakit pinipilit na isangkot yung salita na wala naman sa English dictionary (That’s why I can’t fathom why a word that’s not even in the English dictionary must be involved here),” added the majority lawmaker. Referring to leftist groups, the former deputy speaker said, “Para bang hindi importante sa kanila na bigyan natin ng pondo ang mga ahensyang sila ang tagapagtanggol ng seguridad ng ating bansa at ng ating mamamayan (It’s like it’s not important to them to allocate funds to the agencies that defend the security of the country and its people).” Marcoleta further said that red-tagging was a unnecessary label, as he claimed that the public knows who these leftist personalities were.

Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations has concluded the conduct of marathon budget hearings on 34 different departments and agencies in the efforts to scrutinize the P5.268-trillion 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP). What’s next? On the final day of the per agency deliberations Friday, Sept. 16, the Appropriations panel terminated the consideration of the proposed budgets of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).   On Monday, Sept. 19, the House leadership is expected to file the 2023 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) worth P5.268 trillion. It may contain revisios made after the panel-level budget discussions. House Speaker Martin Romualdez and officials of the appropriations panel chaired by Ako Bicol Rep. Elizaldy Co are expected to be the lead authors of the budget measure. Although the House can realign individual allocations within the GAB based on the NEP, it cannot go over the P5.268-trillion amount set by the executive branch. Next comes the marathon of plenary debates wherein Appropriations panel chairpersons will sponsor and defend the budget of a specific agency from fellow members of the 311-strong legislative chamber.   House plenary sessions are usually held from Monday to Wednesday every week, but the plenary debates will require sessions up to Friday. Co, appropriations panel Senior Vice Chairperson Stella Quimbo, and Majority Leader Mannix Dalipe have all promised that the 2023 GAB would be approved on third and final reading by Oct. 1, 2022. As per the House calendar of session, the lower chamber is set to temporarily adjourn its first regular session on Oct. 1 until Nov. 6.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"House Appropriations Committee Chairman Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co called on the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to keep climate and disaster resiliency in mind when it comes to its projects. “Our public works must also be climate and disaster-resilient to adapt and prepare for the rapid changes in our planet,” Co said in his speech Friday, Sept. 16 during the budget hearing of the DPWH before the House panel. The DPWH is the builder of the government when it comes to infrastructure projects. The Philippines sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire”, an area where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are more recurring than in any other part of the world. Due to its location, the country is also visited by at least 20 typhoons per year, an average of five of which is destructive. Co also reckoned that the agency “must be responsive to the country’s ever-growing population and its ever-increasing demand for efficient delivery of public services, including energy, water, and public transportation”. Under President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the government seeks to expand the previous administration’s “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure modernization program with the “Build, Better, More” program. This committee welcomes and supports the President’s aspirations. Indeed, infrastructure is the backbone of a society’s economy,” Co said. Heading the DPWH contingent in the budget briefing was Secretary Manuel Bonoan. During the proceedings, committee members expressed concern about the department’s unused appropriations in the 2020 (P83 billion) and 2021 (P87.6 billion) enacted budgets. Asked about the amount of unused DPWH funds for 2022, Bonoan told the House body that the department’s current accomplishment is about 90 percent. He said he is confident that the number would increase to 95 percent by year’s end. The DPWH’s proposed outlay for 2023 is P718.36 billion. ",0

This com Makabayan solons have filed a measure that, if enacted, would abolish the country’s regional wage board system in favor of a uniform national minimum wage.  Under House Bill (HB) No.4898, the proposed national minimum wage will be implemented through an enacted legislation or through an executive issuance by the President, the amount of which shall be prescribed by the National Wages and Productivity Board (NWPB). Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro, and Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel jointly authored the bill, the purpose of which is to come up with minimum livable wage for Filipinos. “The highly irrational ‘wage rationalization’ or regionalization has led to the creation of over 1,000 wage levels across the country which are nowhere near the living wage. Dapat ibalik ang pambansang minimum na sahod na disente at nakabubuhay (The decent, livable national minimum wage must be brought back),” Brosas said. “Wage discrepancies per region have also been exploited by businesses to provide lower wages for the same kind of work. This has been the case for business process outsourcing (BPO) workers and several other industries,” she added. The militant lawmaker said the amount for the national minimum wage must approximate, if not equal, the prevailing family living wage (FLW). Currently, inflation-adjusted FLW stands at P1,117 per day for a family of five. The bill also amends the criteria for wage-fixing under Republic Act (RA) 6727 or the Wage Rationalization Act to remove what Makabayan has described as “pro-capitalist parameters” and institute the right to a livable wage as well as the provision of social, physiological, and other needs of workers’ families. “Penalties and revocation of the business permit will be imposed on companies which will not comply with the mandated national minimum wage,” said Brosas. She also welcomed the pronouncement of House Labor Committee Chairman and Rizal 4th district Rep. Fidel Nograles on the need to tackle wage bills soon. The Makabayan bloc will file a separate bill seeking a substantial minimum wage increase to equalize wage levels across regions at P1,100.mittee welcomes and supports the President’s aspirations.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Friday said she finds it “unacceptable” that the privately-owned National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) continues to enjoy soaring profits despite its failure to maintain “brownout-free” operation of the grid.   Hontiveros expressed her sentiment following the recent power outages that have affected at least one million households in Luzon. Therefore, the senator said, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) should make sure to “leave no stone unturned” in its investigation of the recent decision of the NGCP to place the Luzon grid on yellow and red alerts. “Ang laki-laki ng binabayaran ng konsyumer sa kuryente pero taon-taon na lang silang namomroblema sa paulit-ulit na brownout (Consumers have been paying high electricity bills, but every year they get they always have to worry about rotating blackouts),” Hontiveros lamented.   “Ang laki-laki ng kinikita ng NGCP pero puro sablay naman ang kanilang serbisyo (NGCP is getting huge profits but their service is disappointing). It is time for our regulatory agencies to really hold NGCP accountable for failing to keep its promise of improving its services to the public,” she said. In previous Senate hearings, she pointed out executives of the NGCP have committed to work on important reforms which would help address various problems that caused forced outages and rotating blackouts in the country. The senator said NGCP should at least provide Congress updates about the firm contracts for ancillary services which should have been one of the several policy and programs that will provide solutions and further lessen the power supply issues.   “Anyare na, lip service lang ba ito (What happened to that, is this just lip service)?” Hontiveros asked. She also pointed out that the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) allowed the NGCP to implement an interim maximum annual revenue of a whopping P51.471-billion in 2020. But Hontiveros said she learned that NGCP shareholders were able to receive P187.8-billion worth of corporate dividends in just 10 years of their 25-year contract of running the power grid system under the anomalous and controversial weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 15 percent. “The higher revenue is supposed to help NGCP upgrade—and modernize—its transmission infrastructures—that will make the national grid more stable and reliable. Bakit parang walang nangyayaring reporma maliban sa lalong pagyaman ng mga shareholder ng NGCP (Why is nothing is happening except the fact NGCP shareholders are getting richer)?” she pointed out. “In fact, NGCP has a total of 127 delayed transmission projects all over the country and only around 36 have been met within schedule. Obviously, aside from the problems coming from the generation sector supply capacities we also have a clear problem in our transmission courtesy of NGCP,” she said. To this, Hontiveros said she hopes Congress will amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act or the EPIRA Law to bring about changes in the country’s power grid system. “There should be an overall review of the power transmission development plan and implementation process as well as the system operation of the power grid. The EPIRA law must be amended to establish a power industry structure that is responsive to the needs of our people and not only providing profits for bad services,” Hontiveros suggested.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"While President Ferdinand “Bongbong”Marcos Jr. urged the military to help in achieving lasting peace in Mindanao, he told them to still remain on their toes as there are still extremist groups out there who just want to cause trouble. “Meron pa rin diyang mga tiwalag (There are still rebels out there), there are still certain groups, I’m sure you’re aware of them,” Marcos said when he visited the 6th Infantry Division (ID) of the Philippine Army (PA) stationed at Camp Siongco in Sinsuat, Maguindanao on Sept. 15.   “There are still extremist groups na wala nang ideology, banditry na lang (who no longer have ideology, but banditry). They don’t talk of the religion, of ideology basta’t nagki-kidnap na lang, gumagawa ng gulo (they are just kidnapping, causing disorder), murder for hire,” Marcos added. So, the President commanded the soldiers to not let their guard down and keep the peace in their areas. “Nandiyan pa rin ang threat sa inyo diyan kaya (That remains a threat to you). You cannot let your guard down also. You have to stay vigilant and stay careful,” he said. He stressed that maintaining peace and order in their areas in Mindanao is crucial as the government cannot afford to blow its chance in the current peace process, saying they will be back to square one if a huge fighting occurs again.   “‘Pag may nangyari, e tigil lahat (If something happens, everything will be halted). We will have to start again and talk to everybody again but if you can keep the peace in your areas then that will be a big, big, big help para sa ating (for our) peace process,” Marcos said. The Chief Executive said all this to the troops after he encouraged them to help the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in its fulfillment of government functions, following the inaugural session of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (2022-2025). “We must give them a chance to learn how to become a government. We should help them,” he said. Marcos was in Mindanao to attend the ceremonial opening of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority in Cotabato City on Thursday.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Many heads of state and a lot of other people are “very eager” to meet President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. during his trip to New York to participate in this year’s United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Friday. Romualdez’ pronouncement came after the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed the President’s attendance in the largest gathering of world leaders, which will start on Sep. 20. Among state leaders who wanted to have bilateral meetings with Marcos Jr. are Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and one of the presidents of the European Union, the envoy said.   There are also two others as well as leaders from Latin America and Africa who are just awaiting confirmation, he added. “So he’ll probably have at least six to eight meetings with heads of state,” Romualdez said in an interview with CNN Philippines, noting “there are a lot of people who are actually very eager to meet him” and “many head of states have implicated that they would like to have bilateral meeting with the President.” “Like I said, there are a lot of moving parts in these meetings with the United Nations. There are over a hundred who are wanting to meet with each other,” he added. On the other hand, Marcos Jr.’s meeting with US President Joe Biden is still being worked out.   Romualdez maintained both sides wanted to meet each other after Biden became the first head of state to invite the President after he won the elections. The US leader also even sent a personal letter, through one of his friends, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, extending his invitation. “So those are indications that there is eagerness from President Biden to meet our new president. And of course, our President Marcos is also eager to meet President Biden,” he said. On the other, the President is also set to meet with the executives of some of the biggest American firms as part of his roundtable meeting with the CEOs. Romualdez said Marcos Jr. will meet with executives of Cargill, a food, agricultural, financial and industrial American conglomerate that also has operations in the Philippines, as well as with Boeing, which seeks to source agricultural waste from the country to provide “clean energy” for their aircrafts. The President is likewise expected to meet with NuScale, another company pushing for clean energy, he said. “There’s also an infrastructure forum that I think is being set up by the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) where we will have several companies interested in the infrastructure program of the Philippines,” he added.   Marcos Jr.’s meetings seek to promote his administration’s vision to boost the agriculture sector and to shift to clean energy, the envoy said. Romualdez said Marcos will also attend other forums, including a Philippine economic briefing as well as an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Business Council meeting, which is a “very important institution in Washington D.C.” “[The ASEAN Business Council is] hosting a forum for heads of state. More particularly, they’re very interested in President Marcos because he just got newly elected,” he said. “We have so many who want to attend that. In fact, I think we’re having difficulty in trying to accommodate as many as people and many companies,” he added. The envoy wished that Marcos could stay longer in the US to accommodate not only businessmen but also Filipino communities spread across the US and even as far as Guam.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Amid closures of private schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a group expressed appreciation for the stand of Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte on the demands for salary increase among teachers in public schools.  Federation of Associations of Private Schools Administrators (FAPSA) Eleazardo Kasilag, in a statement issued Friday, Sept. 16, said that the stand of Duterte, who is the concurrent Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary, is a “pinch of relief” for private schools that have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic.   During the House appropriations committee deliberations on the proposed P710-billion DepEd budget for 2023, Duterte explained that increasing the salary of public school teachers will later force more private schools to shut down. “Personally, I do not know the implication of this statement of Secretary Duterte but for our group which has gotten used to surviving on the crumbs from the table, any statement that recognizes our dire situation is gratifying,” said Kasilag. Kasilag reiterated that the salary benchmark should be the salary of private school teachers as there is a “wide disparity” between those who teach in public schools. FAPSA also appealed for “fairness” to help smaller private schools — particularly those that are outside of the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE) which handles the voucher and subsidy from the government. Kasilag alleged that the voucher and subsidy from the government — which is coursed through the FAPE — was “never enjoyed by small private schools.” More than ever, he pointed out that “needy and helpless” private schools need support from the government to avoid further closure. Meanwhile, Kasilag expressed disappointment with the move of the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations of the Philippines (COCOPEA) to get a “share in the Internet allowance of public school teachers exclusively for its own members and not for the entire private school education sector.”   Kasilag said that FAPSA has already submitted a position paper to the office of Congressman Roman Romulo, Committee chair on Basic Education in the house, appealing for a review of policies on private school regulations “especially on subsidies since schools’ closure has become enormous this pandemic.”   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Philippine Military Academy (PMA) is now devoid of hazing. Department of National Defense (DND) Officer-in-Charge and Senior Undersecretary Jose Faustino Jr. and Philippine Army Commanding General Romeo Brawner Jr. gave this assurance to the House Committee on Appropriations during the consideration of the department’s proposed budget for 2023. During the budget briefing of the DND Thursday, Sept.16, Batangas 2nd district Rep. Gerville Luistro asked the agency officials if PMA cadets were now safe from hazing.   Luistro’s question harkened back to the death of Cadet 4th Class Darwin Dormitorio in 2019. Dormitorio died from maltreatment supposedly stemming from hazing the Philippine Military Academy, Baguio, Benguet, Philippines. After the case, the PMA instituted reforms specifically aimed at ending the culture of hazing. “The unfortunate incident really shook up the defense establishment, particularly the [PMA] and [AFP] and we have instituted a lot of reforms, as a result of this incident. the survival of our plebes right now is close to almost 98 percent and there are hazing zero cases. That’s what reported for the past year or two,” Faustino said.   “So we can assure the public, particularly the parents that want to send their children to the [PMA] that the [PMA] remains as the premier military institution at least in this part of the region and we can assure that their sons and daughters will be taken [care] of and will be given premium education,” he said. Brawner attested to Faustino’s declaration, going as far to say that the reforms led to the “total eradication” of hazing at the institution. “The [DND] has instituted a lot of reforms within the [PMA] that led to the total eradication of hazing, your honor. Right now, we are proud to announce that there is no more hazing at the [PMA], he said. “Some of the initiated actions ordered by the then-[DND] Secretary [Delfin] Lorenzana are the following: the segregation of the barracks or the dormitory of the whole cadet corps separating, the, the freshman from the rest of the upperclassmen in the cadet corps; the continuous indoctrination of pertinent laws and regulations such as the anti-hazing law to all cadets; the empowering of the first-class cadets, that’s to report their upperclassmen; the empowering of the first-year cadets to report their upperclassmen as well as giving emphasis on critical thinking, as followers in different leadership and followership theories. And the sustained leveling among the personnel handling the cadet corps with emphasis on the honor code and the regulations of the cadet corps,” enumerated Brawner. Dormitorio was laid to rest in his hometown of Cagayan de Oro with full military honors.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Sherwin Gatchalian is now seeking the passage of the bill that would eventually empower the country’s taxpayers through basic education, information and dialogues.   In filing Senate Bill No. 1199, or the proposed Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights and Obligations Act, Gatchalian said taxpayers’ should be made aware of their basic right to participate in dialogues, and information or education campaigns to elicit awareness on their rights and obligations while helping them comply with revenue laws, rules and regulations. Gatchalian said such policy, including requiring revenue authorities to provide quality service to taxpayers, will enhance the government’s revenue collection efforts.   “We are aware that taxation laws can sometimes become very difficult to understand by ordinary taxpayers and it is critical that we enable them to appreciate these laws more clearly,” Gatchalian said. For instance, he said taxpayers must be made aware of what to do when presented with a letter of authority (LOA) by revenue officers and representatives if they want to examine the books of accounts. A LOA is required to be presented to a taxpayer before any audit or assessment takes place. Gatchalian explains a LOA basically presents the authority given to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) officer to perform assessment functions to ensure the collection of the correct amount of tax.   “Kailangang basahin nang maigi ng taxpayer ang nakasulat sa dokumento na ipapakita ng revenue officer kung magsasagawa ito ng audit upang malaman ng taxpayer kung mayroong anumang discrepancy o inconsistency (the taxpayer should read carefully what is stated in the document that would be shown by the revenue officer that will conduct the audit so he would know if there is any discrepancy or inconsistency),” he pointed out. If the name of the BIR officer that will conduct the audit is different from the name stated in the document, a taxpayer has the right to refuse, Gatchalian explained. “Mahalagang malaman ng mga taxpayer ang kanilang mga karapatan bilang proteksyon laban sa ilang mapang-abusong alagad ng gobyerno (It’s very important that the taxpayer would know their right as protection against abusive public officials),” he stressed. The lawmaker noted the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) in 2020 has identified the BIR as the “most complained agencies.” The April 2022 report of the Revenue Integrity Protection Service (RIPS) of the finance department showed that 55 percent of the 468 employees investigated from the period July 2016 to February 2022 were from the Bureau of Customs (BOC) while 38 percent were from the BIR. The erring employees were either dismissed from service, found guilty in criminal cases, suspended, or ordered to pay fines. “Inaasahan natin na sa pamamagitan ng panukalang batas na ito ay lalo pa nating maiangat ang tiwala at kumpiyansa ng ating mga taxpayers sa gobyerno nang sa ganun ay mas maging handa sila para tuparin ang kanilang obligasyon sa pagbabayad ng buwis at maging maayos ang pangongolekta ng gobyerno ng buwis (We expect that thru the passage of this bill, we can enhance the trust and confidence of our taxpayers in our government so that they would be ready to fulfill their tax obligations and the government’s tax collection would improve),” Gatchalian stressed.

Manila Bulletin,"In order to prevent corruption and curtail the practice of parking funds among district officials, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano said contractors of public projects should be required to submit photos of their construction projects at certain phases of completion. Cayetano said it is only a practical solution for the government in its bid to curb any corrupt practices at the district level. “For me, like a practical solution lang, kailangan dapat lahat ng contractor ng DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) mag-submit ng litrato n’ung project zero percent, 50 percent,100 percent (All DPWH contractors should be mandated to submit photos of the project at zero percent, 50 percent and 100 percent),” Cayetano said in a media interview on September 15, 2022.   Cayetano made the proposal after exposing what he called the “expanded fund parking scheme” during a manifestation during the Senate briefing of the proposed national budget by the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) earlier this week. He also urged the DBCC to look into the possible existence of a syndicate behind the illegal realignment of billions of pesos in funds in the budget of the DPWH. The lawmaker noted that then-DPWH Secretary and now Senator Mark Villar had made it a policy that a congressional district’s budget should more or less be at the same amount so that ongoing projects and continuing programs are sustained.   In an interview on Thursday, September 15, Cayetano revealed that some corrupt officials have turned their practices to rural development projects that are too far from the public eye to be monitored, such as flood control, dredging, and asphalt road constructions. “N’ung araw kasi hindi naman nilalagyan ng malaking pera y’ung mga liblib ‘di ba? Eh ngayon dahil may rural development tayo, napansin ko any project na hindi mo nakikita, halimbawa flood control nasa ilalim ‘yan o kaya any project na malayo y’ung lugar walang internet, walang media, mas y’un po ang pinagkakakitaan (Before, far-flung places hardly ever get a public works budget, right? But now that we have rural development plans, I notice that there are unseen projects, like flood control under that or any project in places that do not have internet, no media, it seems they earn from there),” he said. “Y’un y’ung mga favorite na hindi nababantayan so we have to have a practical way na bantayan (those are the favorite projects that can’t be monitored, so we have to have a practical way to monitor those projects),” he continued. Cayetano said it is imperative for the government to take practical steps from preventing the “parking of funds” from happening, regardless if they are isolated or just rumors from members of Congress holding a grudge because they had received a lower budget. While exposing such practices may alarm the guilty and force them to hide their activities, prevention should be the priority, the lawmaker stressed. The senator also expressed hope DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan would look into the issue. “Bawat bagong administrasyon talaga may nagte-testing eh. Kaya nga napakaimportante na ngayon na umpisa pa lang ng administrasyon, tulungan natin ang administrasyon na wala tayong mapapalusot na schemes, scam, o attempt (Every administration are always tested. That’s why it’s very important that from the start of the administratio, let’s help the administration get rid of these schemes, scam or any attempt to scam),” he said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Facing contempt charges in the US, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is not expected to address this matter during his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). “It is not part of the agenda as far as we can see,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a joint presser with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) ahead of Marcos’ departure. Her remark came after she was asked if the President would settle his legal liability when he arrives in the US.   Marcos Jr. has been ordered in contempt by a US Court of Appeals for violating an injunction that barred him and his mother, Imelda, from dissipating assets of the estate. In a recent roundtable discussion, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told reporters the President would be welcome to come to the US as he has diplomatic immunity as the head of state. “The fact is, when you’re a head of state, you have immunity in all circumstances and are welcome to the United States in your official role,” Sherman said.

Manila Bulletin,"The public can expect President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to highlight his plans to revive the country’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic during his upcoming working visit to the United States of America (USA) next week. Malacañang said this days before Marcos’ scheduled trip to New York City from September 18 to 24 for the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).   In a pre-departure briefing, Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said that the President’s objective since his election this year was to aid the Philippines’ economic recovery. “His intent for the administration is for economic recovery. Therefore, his activities are always pursuant to that. His speech will be in pursuit of that,” she said Thursday, September 15. “In fact, the delegation is composed, primarily, of his economic team, plus,” she added. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), President Marcos’ delegation comprises secretaries, undersecretaries, and support staff of different government agencies. These agencies include the departments of Trade and Industry (DTI), Finance (DOF), and Migrant Workers (DMW); the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA); and about 20 to 30 senior Philippine corporate executives.   According to DFA Assistant Secretary for the Office of American Affairs (OAA) JV Chan Gonzaga, Marcos’ upcoming trip to the US is more than his international debut. “The President has made it very clear from the initial discussions preparatory to this trip to New York, that it will be more than his debut on the world stage,” he said. “He gave unequivocal instructions that his meetings, whether with fellow world leaders or with US corporations, should focus on finding necessary partnerships that will benefit the Philippine economy and the Filipino people,” he added. Gonzaga said Marcos would not spare any effort to address the economic challenges that the Philippines is facing. Hence, his meeting with American businessmen at an economic briefing in New York. “This meeting is expected to attract institutional investors, senior corporate executives, business analysts, and even academics, think tanks, and entrepreneurs,” he said. “This briefing will be an opportunity to outline the key economic priorities of his administration, with a special focus on how we can hopefully expand and strengthen Philippine-US trade and investment relations during his term,” he added.   At the briefing, Gonzaga said the country’s economic managers would speak on macro-economic and sectoral issues that might interest potential US investors and partners. Aside from the Philippine economic briefing, President Marcos will participate in roundtables designed to project the Philippines as an important emerging economy and investment destination in Asia. “We expect the one-on-one business meetings of the President to deal with priority areas that can engender a quick post-pandemic economic recovery and the long-term resilience of the Philippine economy,” Gonzaga said. Marcos also intends to meet with US companies that could contribute to the administration’s efforts to achieve food security, energy security, and sustainable economic development. According to Gonzaga, the President is expected to meet the US Chamber of Commerce, the US-ASEAN Business Council, and the US-Philippines Society. “At these engagements, he will be able to have wide-ranging and candid discussions with political, business, and community leaders on raising the profile of the Philippines in the United States; contributing to the President’s economic agenda; and strengthening Philippine-US political, economic, and cultural ties,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is expected to discuss his administration’s priorities such as climate change, the rule of law, and food security at the High-Level General Debate of the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 20, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said. DFA Assistant Secretary for the Office of the United Nations and International Organizations Kira Azucena said this days ahead of the President’s scheduled trip to New York for the UNGA on September 18.   In a pre-departure press briefing, Azucena said Marcos would deliver the Philippine national statement at the High-Level General Debate. His speaking slot is approximately 3:15 p.m. on September 20 (New York time). The theme of this year’s General Debate is: “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges.” The UN said among these challenges are the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, humanitarian challenges of unprecedented nature, a tipping point in climate change, and threats to the global economy. “It is, therefore, necessary to find and focus on joint solutions to these crises and build a more sustainable and resilient world for all and for the generations to come,” the UN said. According to Azucena, Marcos will enumerate solutions to address these interlocking challenges, the role of the United Nations, and how the Philippines intends to contribute to these efforts.   The President’s statement will also articulate his administration’s priorities, including climate change, the rule of law, and food security, she said. Around 152 other heads of state and government will participate in the High-Level General Debate. “The President will take this opportunity to meet with some of them during his stay in New York. He will also meet with some key United Nations officials,” Azucena said. According to the DFA official, Marcos’ participation in the opening of UNGA77 is important as it marks his first engagement with the United Nations, which the Philippines recognizes as the world’s most important multilateral organization. The High-Level General Debate is deemed as the most important part of the UNGA, politically, because this is where world leaders articulate policy statements on world affairs and international relations. Aside from speaking at the UNGA, Marcos is also expected to push for the country’s economic recovery and meet business leaders in New York.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Vice President Sara Duterte did not mince words as she called out reports that, she said, “maliciously” suggested she was using a government helicopter every day for personal travel. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Sept. 15, the Vice President explained that her birthday post for President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. was simply an appreciation “for the man who has shown great concern for a working mother and how he provided his all-out support for his Vice President to be able to move around quickly and accomplish work efficiently.”   It was far from the allegations on social media that she had been using government resources to travel back home after she was quoted thanking the Chief Executive for letting her use a government helicopter assigned to the Presidential Security Group (PSG). Duterte said her post was also an “appreciation” to the President’s team “who works long hours, tirelessly hopping from one island province to another to reach our fellow Filipinos.”   However, she lamented how her post was maliciously interpreted in various social media posts.  “I believe that a person who can conjure a lie from an appreciation post — that a helicopter is being used to go home every day, even giving in to the itch of maliciously suggesting that it is for personal use — should seriously reflect on why he had to lie,” she wrote. “I think that if this person can recognize his anger, he will be able to overcome his bitter and spiteful self. Hopefully, he becomes a better version of himself — despite the cycle of hate that has enslaved him,” Duterte added.   Duterte’s use of the helicopter as she mentioned in her birthday greeting to Marcos on Tuesday, Sept. 13, earned the ire of netizens since she said it was to get home in time for her children’s bedtime. In her birthday greeting to Marcos, Duterte highlighted how he has helped her cope as a working mother. “Thank you, PBB, and your 250th PAW for ensuring that wherever I may be found in the country during the day, I am home in time to tuck my children to bed,” she said. The 250th PAW, known as the Bluebirds, is one of the units of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) attached and assigned to the Presidential Security Group (PSG).  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Grace Poe called on authorities to immediately look into alleged trafficking of persons carried out by syndicates who organize foreign tours to lure their victims. Poe said tight coordination among the police and concerned government agencies is needed amid the spate of kidnappings, including those linked to exploitation of women.   “Ang nangyayari raw, may mga turistang pumupunta rito, pagdating nila rito nakikidnap sila tapos binebenta sa isang sindikato (There are some tourists who come here only to be kidnapped and sold to syndicates.. ‘Pag nabawi na nu’ng sindikato yung nagastos nila saka lang pakakawalan ‘yung mga turista (It is only when the syndicate has recouped its expenses would it set these tourists free),” she said on Thursday’s hearing of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs that tackled the recent wave of kidnappings. The senator said the Bureau of Immigration (BI) should step up its inspection of foreigners entering the country to ensure they are legitimate visitors and are not trafficked persons. Poe also urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) to work with organizations such as the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry which recently sought the government’s help following the 56 kidnapping cases in 10 days that was reported to the group. She said the PNP Directorate for Legislative and Detective Management also released its data showing a total of 8,525 index crimes happening from January to March this year, and another 8,469 crimes from June to August, 2022.   “Given this data, I’d like to point out that it still means an average of 15 murder and homicides, 14 rape cases, and 14 robberies occurring everyday. These are reported. Is this a normal situation?” Poe asked. “This puts to question what the PNP has been saying in the past few days that there’s no crime hike, just hype,” she added. Poe expressed alarm over the reported torture, intimidation and rape of kidnap victims, including foreigners. Reports have said that videos of these cruelties are sent to their families to demand huge sums of money. “Are our authorities not worried about the possibility of escalation?” she said. Poe said the PNP should designate a spokesperson to issue official statements and data. “Lately, ang daming nagsasalita (There are many persons talking). The PNP should have a spokesperson. Clear and accurate information will help solve the problem we are facing about kidnappings,” Poe said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Two senators – Imee Marcos and Ronald ‘’Bato’’ dela Rosa – seek a whole of government approach on the inflow of foreigners with questionable backgrounds and the rise of kidnapping cases caused mostly by the Philippine Overseas Gaming Operator (POGO) operations that affect the country’s national security. Senator Joseph Victor ‘’JV’’ Ejercito also revealed in today’s public hearing by the Senate public order and dangerous drugs committee chaired by dela Rosa that there are Chinese citizens who come into the country using identification papers of dead Filipinos. Given the territorial dispute between the Philippines and China, Ejercito said it is easy to spot a person with military bearing compared to the easy-going gait of POGO workers. He was referring to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).   Not all Chinese-looking foreigners are Chinese. They could be Malaysians, Burmese or Cambodians, resource speakers said. It is, thus, necessary for the Philippines to reach out to its Southeast Asian security network as foreigners such as those from Burma, Cambodia and Malaysia come into the country and work as syndicate members, mostly at POGOs, Marcos said. The Filipino-Chinese community expressed fears of the rising cases of kidnapping where the victims, after the payment of ransom has been made by their families, are then sold to other groups. But most of the kidnapping cases in the country are related to the multi-billion-peso operations of POGO operators conducted by Chinese because China considers POGO operations as illegal.   Marcos said she is pleased that the Chinese community understand each other and that they could ‘’recommend the best approach to make.’’ She also pleaded with the PNP to work closely with local government units with the regard to rape cases involving school girls. The Bureau of Immigration (BI) testified that, after an economic slow down in the country since 2020 caused by Covid-19 pandemic in the country, it has resumed implementing its biometric system to incoming travelers. Marcos said that clearly, the Philippines has to adopt a whole of government approach by being creative and innovative ‘’since we do not have yet a central data base, not even for our nationals.’’ Let us put in place a real whole of government with a list of foreign nationals primarily and sharing them with law enforcement agencies, she added. Since the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has a list of work permits issued to POGO workers, Marcos said the Department of Trade and Investments (DTI) should compel its investors to produce these lists ‘’and the BI to provide its list as well.’’   She questioned the entry of foreigners ‘’classified’’ as retirees in the Philippine Retirement Agency with $50,000 although they are very young at the age of 35. “All these informations should be shared with he Philippine National Police (PNP),” and others, she added. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) said POGO had the highest revenue of P6-billion in 2018. Dela Rosa sald foreigners engaged in questionable activities should be deported immediately because they are wrecking havoc on the economy. Although the PNP has given assurance that there is nothing to fear, Marcos asked aloud why there is fear in the country. While the PNP said there has been only 10 kidnapping cases reported to them, two Filipino-Chinese groups maintained that the figure is more than 30 cases reported to their chapters but that this could be more because of unreported cases. There are times dela Rosa would utter expletives and sometimes castigate the PNP ‘’but take It as a challenge,’’ dela Rosa, a former PNP chief said Ko Benchum, executive committee member of the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc, (FFCCCI), said the Chinese community is ‘’worried’’ over the sale of kidnapped victims after they family have already paid the ransom. Ko stressed that not all Chinese-looking persons are Chinese because they could be Vietnamese or Cambodians. He said the Chinese government is very strict in allowing its citizens leave mainland China. ‘’Very few are allowed to go out to the Philippines,’’ he added. Police Lt. General Jose Chiquito Malayo assured dela Rosa and the Chinese community that ‘’everythig is under control’’ ’and the federation members are in good hands. ` He said violent incidents that have been spearing in social media did not the take place in the Philippines.” After four hours, dela Rosa announced that his committee has ended its committee hearing, The hearing was trigged by a resolution of Marcos on the “alarming reports of a rise in kidnapping disappearances and killing of women in the country.’’  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito on Thursday, September 15 urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) to look into reports of foreign nationals who have been using the identities of deceased persons to secure government-issued identification cards in the Philippines.   Ejercito raised the issue during the hearing of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs on the recent spate of kidnappings and disappearances across the country. The senator said he hopes the PNP will ramp up its operations against these criminal activities.   “PNP, please take note of that. We will confirm pero alam ko na nangyayari ‘to. Marami nang mga foreign nationals, in particular, mga mainland Chinese na pumasok dito (this is happening. There are many foreign nationals, in particular, from mainland China that were allowed to enter here) who are using identities of dead persons so that they can avail of rights and be considered as Filipino citizens,” he said. Fortunato Manahan Jr., OIC deputy commissioner at the Bureau of Immigration (BI), confirmed Ejercito’s claims saying they have deported a number of foreign nationals for using fraudulent passports, birth certificates, and marriage certificates. Manahan said: “May mga (there are) cases and incidents po kaming naiintercept sa (that we intercept in the) airports and in the community. Napapadeport po namin ang mga ‘yon (We are able to deport them).”   Ejercito earlier filed Senate Resolution No. 194, asking the Senate panel to investigate the “alarming cases” of kidnapping, abduction and disappearances, especially those against women, Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) workers, and Filipino-Chinese individuals. The senator raised the alleged kidnapping of a Chinese national in broad daylight along the Skyway elevated highway and the documented torture of a male victim whose ear was cut off. “Definitely, peace and order situation is the biggest factor in having a climate conducive for business to grow for us to be able to rebuild the economy after the pandemic,” Ejercito said. “Kailangan po maganda ang (We need to have a better) peace and order situation. Ngayon pa lang tayo nakakabuwelo (We are just gaining momentum) after the two years of lockdown in the pandemic,” he said. “We have to verify the authenticity of these videos so that we can attack the problems already head on and not cause panic sa ating mamamayan at business sector,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Vice President Sara Duterte on Thursday, Sept. 15, highlighted the importance of democracy and freedom the country enjoys today as she celebrated with Bulakenyos the 124th anniversary of Malolos Congress. She joined the commemoration of the Malolos Congress at the historical Barasoain Church this morning.   In her 12-minute speech, Duterte noted that the historical opening of the Malolos Congress became the foundation of the country’s democracy. “Ang demokrasyang ito ang pinakamahalagang pamana ng ating mga ninuno sa atin — na malaya nating tinatamasa hanggang ngayon (This democracy is the most important inheritance from our forefathers—that we freely enjoy until today),” Duterte said.   She greeted the province and people of Malolos in the celebration and emphasized the important chapter of the country’s history that happened in Barasoain. “Mahalaga ang pagdiriwang na ito sa ating kasaysayan bilang mga Pilipino dahil ang pagbubukas ng Kongreso ng Malolos noong Sept. 15, 1898, ang naging hudyat ng pagsilang ng isang malayang republika — ang Republika ng Pilipinas (This celebration is important to our history because the opening of the Congress of Malolos on Sept. 15, 1898 became the signal that birthed a free republic—the Republic of the Philippines),” Duterte added. Malolos Constitution was the constitution of the First Philippine Republic which made the country the first-ever free republic in Asia. The Vice President said that one of the things Filipinos can learn from the opening of the Congress in Malolos is the importance of love for country. She stressed that if Filipinos will be united in the same dream, goal, and asiprations, they will be able to surpass and bring themselves back together amidst all hardships. “Mula nang buksan ang Kongreso ng Malolos — malayo na ang ating narating bilang isang bansa. Maraming dagok rin ang ating sinagupa — bagyo, lindol, pandemya. Pero hindi tayo tumigil at hindi tayo titigil (Since the opening of the Congress in Malolos—we’ve gone a long way as a country. We have battled through a lot of blows—typhoons, earthquakes, pandemic. But we haven’t stopped and we will not stop),” Duterte said. “Ngayon ay patuloy nating itinataguyod ang isa’t-isa at ang ating bansa para bumangon, para umusad, para umunlad (Now we continue to uplift one another and our country to stand up, to move forward, to progress),” she added Anchored on the theme “Kongreso ng Malolos: Patnubay sa Pagtataguyod ng Nagkakaisang Bansa”, the activity started with a flag raising ceremony, followed by the oath to the Philippine flag and wreath-laying at the monument of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, the first Philippine president. Duterte, together with Bulacan Governor Daniel Fernando, Vice Gov. Alexis Castro, Malolos City Mayor Christian Natividad, and Dr. Rene Escalante, chairman of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), led the celebration. The Malolos Congress ratified the first Philippine Constitution that eventually led to the proclamation of Philippine independence from the Spanish colonial rule on June 12, 1899.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has reiterated his call to the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) to “pass all crucial” laws that will secure the welfare of the people of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). “I urge you to pass all the crucial legislations on fiscal policy, particularly taxation, and to facilitate the conduct of the elections in the BARMM in 2025,” Marcos said as he graced the ceremonial opening of the session of the BTA in Cotabato City on Thursday, Sept. 15.   The President further encouraged the body to pass measures that will secure the welfare of the Moro people particularly in agri-fishery, healthcare, transportation, communication, digital infrastructure, and e-governance. He said this as he noted that the government, through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM, has allocated P74.4 billion for the Bangsamoro region fiscal year 2023. This, he said, would ensure that the BTA could deliver its commitments to the people of BARMM. During his speech, the Chief Executive also pledged his administration’s full support to the peace process and to the BARMM. “As your President, I assure you, the BTA and all the Bangsamoro people, of this administration’s full and unwavering commitment to the peace process and to BARMM,” he said.   He stated that the diverse representation of the new BTA composition “speaks volumes of your answer towards that call for unity, of shared responsibility, and the invitation to advocate peace and development in the Bangsamoro region.” “The path to lasting peace is always under construction. But we walk this path together and we walk it, not because it is an easy one,” he said. “We walk this path together because even if it is difficult, we know that at the end of the journey is historical justice, progress, peace, stability, and the unity that our peoples and our nation have long aspired for and so rightly deserve,” he added. In August 2022, Marcos led the oath taking of the new officials of the BTA held in Malacañang. He also made a pronouncement that “there will no longer be any extensions” in the conduct of BARMM elections in 2025.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa warned that the P1-billion proposed allocation to fund the compensation of Marawi siege victims next year is not sufficient and may eventually trigger complaints from claimant-beneficiaries.   Dela Rosa, vice chairperson of the Senate Committee on Finance, aired his concern during the Development Budget Coordinating Committee on the proposed 2023 national budget. Under the Marcos’ administration’s proposed National Expenditure Program (NEP) for next year, only P1-billioin is allocated for the Marawi Siege Compensation Fund.   The fund forms part of the compensation to any lawful owner of a residential, cultural, commercial structures and other properties within Marawi’s main affected areas or other affected areas destroyed or damaged during the Marawi siege. Beneficiaries of the fund also include owners of private properties demolished pursuant to the implementation of the Marawi Recovery Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program. Dela Rosa, who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Marawi City Rehabilitation and Victims’ Compensation, said he is concerned that extremists may use the P1-billion allocation to sow hatred towards the government.   Because before Republic Act 11696 or the Marawi Siege Victims Compensation Act was signed into law last April by then President Duterte, Congress, during its deliberation of the measure, had estimated the needed amount to be around P30-billion. “Nasusundan ko po ang mga development nito and ang takot ko lang nito ay kapag dumagsa yung mga claimants doon, P1 billion is not enough…pwede na naman ito gawing issue sa ating ng mga, alam mo na, ‘yung mga extremists (I’m monitoring the developments of this law, and I am afraid of what could happen when claimants troop there. P1-billion is not enough…the extremist groups may use this issue),” Dela Rosa pointed out. “Magiging breeding ground na naman uli itong Marawi for (This can be another breeding ground for Marawi) radicalization by exploiting this issue na napabayaan sila na ilang taon na silang hindi nakabalik sa kanilang bahay because problema nga nitong compensation na hinihintay nila para ma-reconstruct nila o ma-rebuild uli nila ‘yung kanilang negosyo doon sa Marawi City (That they were negleected for many years and failed to return to their homes because of problems on compensation that they are waiting for to reconstruct and rebuild their businesses in Marawi City),” he said. Dela Rosa urged the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) then to make sure that the Board would be fully operational and that all beneficiaries would be accorded a grant. DBM Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, in response, said the Senate committee may provide additional funds for the compensation budget. Sen. Sonny Angara, chair of the Senate finance committee, assured that additional funds can be given when the need arises.  ",0

Manila Bulletin,"Sagip Party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta wants to know if his right to education was violated after he was dropped by his advisor as he was finishing his doctoral dissertation in 2017.   Marcoleta, during the House Committee on Appropriations hearing for the Commission on Human Rights’ (CHR) budget on Thursday, Sept. 15, shared an anecdote of an experience that has bothered him for years. “I want to inform this committee that because of this position, yung (the) P1,000 budget. I was then doing my doctoral dissertation at the University of the Philippines (UP). Alam po ba ninyo na yung aking advisor iniwanan ako dahil sa aking ginawa (Did you know that my advisor dropped me because of what I did), did you know that?” Marcoleta asked CHR Executive Director Jacqueline De Guia. During the plenary budget deliberations in 2017, Marcoleta moved that the CHR be allocated a budget of only P1,000. The House, at the time, approved the motion through voice vote. “Mabuti na lang kasing tapang ako ni (It’s a good thing that I’m as brave as) Congressman [Albay 1st district Rep. Edcel] Lagman. Natapos ko rin ang aking doctoral dissertation kahit di ako tinulungan (I finished my doctoral dissertation even if I had no help),” Marcoleta continued. “Wala ba akong na-violate na human right doon (Was any of my human rights violated)? Whether for or against a particular issue, trabaho po namin yon eh (it’s our job),” the party-list solon asked. De Guia acknowledged Marcoleta’s point and said that the CHR would look into the matter. “Meron po tayong (We do have the) right to education and of course we would want to make sure that everyone is able to access that right,” she said. Marcoleta is of the opinion that the CHR’s mandate and jurisdiction is to investigate human rights abuses perpetrated by both state actors or the government, and those perpetrated by non-state actors such as terrorist groups and criminal syndicates. He cited this as the reason why he moved to reduce the CHR’s budget to P1,000 back in 2017. However, fellow solon and human rights lawyer Lagman disagreed with him “I don’t recall any law wherein the CHR is given jurisdiction over atrocities committed by non-state actors. These atrocities or violation of the law are within the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the proper courts,” Lagman said in his interpellation during the hearing. “All definitions of human rights violations are limited to agents of the state and private persons or groups with the consent or acquiescence of the state…You do not have to please legislators by extending your jurisdiction and spreading so thinly your small budget,” he continued. De Guia said “human rights thought is also evolving…There has been a widening of the understanding of human rights and what it pertains to… With the evolution of human rights we also look into other actors of society which have an effect on human rights, which the CHR must look into.” The CHR asked for a budget of P1,646,103,000 for 2023. But, under the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP), they were granted only half the amount or P846,377,000. This is a decrease of P118,326,000 or 12.27 percent versus their 2022 enacted budget of P964,703,000.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives has now completely filled up the chairmanships of all 65 standing committees and 15 special committees of the lower chamber in the current 19th Congress. This was announced Thursday, Sept. 15 by House Majority Leader and Zamboanga City 2nd district Rep. Mannix Dalipe. During last Tuesday’s plenary session, the House leadership elected the last three chairpersons for the remaining vacant posts in the committees. These are PATROL Party-list Rep. Jorge Bustos as chairman of the House Committee on Veteran Affairs and Welfare, Agusan del Sur 1st district Rep. Alfelito Bascug as chairman of the Special Committee on Persons with Disabilities, and Davao de Oro 1st district Rep. Maria Carmen Zamora as chairwoman of the Special Committee on Strategic Intelligence. “All of our standing committees and special committees are 100 percent filled up and ready to carry out their mandate as provided under the Constitution, “ Dalipe said. “I feel relieved that we have finally filled up the organizational gaps. Now we are ready to focus on our primary mandate which is to create legislations that can make life better for our people,” added the majority leader. Dalipe said the full constitution of all the committees is very crucial for the expeditious passage of the Marcos administration’s priority legislative agenda and the timely approval of the P5.268 National Expenditure Program (NEP) for 2023. The House, through the Committee on Appropriations, is scheduled to conclude its per agency budget deliberations on Friday, Sept. 16. The congressmen will then prepare for the plenary debates on the national budget, which will start Monday, Sept. 19.   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Department of National Defense (DND) Office-in-Charge and Senior Undersecretary Jose Faustino Jr. has said that the agency will continue to back the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) under the Marcos administration, calling it a “game-changer”.  “We have proven that the national task force, all our efforts of the NTF-ELCAC has been the game changer,” Faustino told the House Committee on Appropriations on Thursday, Sept. 15 during the budget deliberation of the DND. “Since the implementation sir of NTF-ELCAC, 2019 to present, the following are the significant accomplishments of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), as the head agency of the…cluster, and of course, the DND,” he said. “We have cleared communist terror terrorist groups (CTG)-controlled barangays, we have redirected sectoral front organizations, we have neutralized CTG personalities and we have accounted several firearms and we have recovered some, a big number of anti-personnel mines,” he said. “And more importantly,” Faustino continued, “We were able to dismantle this time around 60 guerrilla fronts. So, the [DND] will continue sir to support this [NTF-ELCAC].” The DND head honcho said the NTF-ELCAC has been a game-changer because in just three years of implementation, “We were able to see the downtrend in all the parameters of these communist terrorist groups.” “We are now continuing this program and the DND will support this program,” Faustino stressed. “As I mentioned, this is a game-changer and we see that we are now approaching the irreversible trend for the other side to recover…I can say that we have lessened the threat of the [CTGs],” he added. The NTF-ELCAC, which critics have linked to alleged red-tagging activities, was hatched during the previous Duterte administration.           ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Judiciary members, government prosecutors, law enforcers, and representatives of local government units (LGUs) started in Cebu City last Wednesday, Sept. 14, their justice zone (JZ) dialogue for coordination and cooperation in the administration of justice. JZs are projects of the Justice Sector Coordinating Council (JSCC) which is composed of the Supreme Court (SC), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). They serve as venues “where key programs relating to the delivery of justice are in place to maximize coordination among the different agency actors to address the perennial issue of delay and the greater problem of accountability.” Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo led the JSCC’s justice zone dialogue in Cebu City.   The SC’s public information office (PIO) said the Cebu City dialogue “was the first of a series of face-to-face dialogues among the justice sector stakeholders that will be held to ensure that the existing Justice Zones will be able to maximize their potential and continue to be effective mechanisms for coordination and cooperation.” Chief Justice Gesmundo said the JZ’s dialogue series will help the JSCC hear directly from the frontliners of the justice sector the activities that are happening on the ground, as well as their accomplishments and the issues they are facing. Gesmundo underscored the value of their dialogue as the JSCC formulates and adopts policies and programs that will be more focused and truly responsive. He then asked all those involved in the JZs to take part in the SC’s Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations 2022-2027 (SPJI) aimed primarily at dispensing “real-time justice.” He said: “I urge you to study the Strategic Plan of the Supreme Court to see how your activities can align with the activities planned for the next five years. In doing this, I believe that the Cebu City Justice Zone will be able to lead all the other Justice Zones in achieving 100 percent delivery of responsive and real-time justice within the next two years.” Aside from that in Cebu City, the eight other JZs are in Quezon City, Davao City, Angeles City, Bacolod City, Naga City,Calamba City, Balanga City, and Baguio City. The JZs in Balanga City and Baguio City were inaugurated after Gesmundo took over the top post in the judiciary in April 2021.   Gesmundo was joined in the Cebu City dialogue by Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez and Interior Undersecretary Oscar Valenzuela. Also present were SC Justices Amy C. Lazaro-Javier, Rodil V. Zalameda, Samuel H. Gaerlan, Jhosep Y. Lopez, Jose Midas P. Marquez, and Maria Filomena D. Singh; Court of Appeals Justices Jennifer Ong and Michael Ong; Court Administrator Raul B. Villanueva; Deputy Court Administrator Jenny Lind R. Aldecoa-Delorino; Assistant Court Administrator and PIO Chief Brian Keith F.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Francis Tolentino has expressed his support for the postponement of the December 2022 barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections. The postponement is embodied in Senate Bill 1306 under Committee Report No. 4 of the Senate Committee on Electoral Reforms and People’s Participation chaired by Senator Imee Marcos.   Marcos stated that the postponement would move the barangay and SK elections to the first week of December 2023, effectively extending the terms of the officials by another year. Tolentino, vice chairman of the said committee, stressed that his reason for supporting the postponement is the urgent need to amend the decades-old Local Government Code, or Republic Act No. 7160, which was enacted in 1991. As the former Mayor of Tagaytay City for three consecutive terms, Tolentino stated that the amendment of the LGC would require a substantial amendment of the functions of the officials enumerated therein. These newfound functions would result in the efficient and effective implementation of the Mandanas ruling, he explained.   As confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2019, the Mandanas ruling is projected to increase the local government units’ share in the national taxes by 27.61 percent. “I am in favor of a one-year postponement of the barangay [and Sangguniang] Kabataan elections because it will pave the way for the revision, the long awaited revision of the Local Government Code. The time of one year would probably be sufficient enough for our barangay officials to lead in the grassroots level, the post-pandemic economic recovery envisioned by our President in the national government,’’ he explained.

Manila Bulletin,"This time it’s authorized and legal. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has approved the importation of sugar not exceeding 150,000 metric tons (MT) amid the shortage of supply and surging prices of the commodity.   After consultations and consideration of all inputs from stakeholders, the importation, which became the subject of controversy, was finally authorized by Marcos through Sugar Order No. 2 dated Sept. 13. According to the Sugar Order, the importation, which shall not exceed 150,000 MT, will be broken down to two allocations. It was disclosed that 75,000 MT will be intended for industrial users while the remaining half will be for consumers. The importation was approved due to “prevailing circumstances” such as the shortage of supply and rising prices of sugar in the country.   “In view of prevailing circumstances when sugar production and supply are usually stable characterized by the start of the milling season for Crop Year 2022-2023, the SRA, in the exercise of its regulatory authority on a ‘pro hac vice’ or ‘for this one particular occasion’ basis, and taking into consideration its mandate of classifying imported sugar according to its appropriate classification, deems it necessary to provide import program,” the order read. The importation is intended for crop year 2022 to 2023. The imported sugar must arrive in the Philippines not later than Nov. 15 this year. Traders who are allowed to participate in the importation are all duly registered SRA International Sugar Trader, in good standing for crop years 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 with renewed registration for crop year 2022-2023. The President’s approval came a month after an unauthorized and “illegal” Sugar Order was released, allowing the importation of 300,000 MT of sugar to address the country’s sugar problem. The controversy became the first major issue under Marcos administration. It led to the resignation of several SRA and Agriculture executives and a Senate investigation.   On Aug. 15, a few days after the discovery of the unauthorized Sugar Order, Marcos floated his intention to instead import 150,000 MT of sugar.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) should maximize the use of the Access Devices Regulation Act of 1998 to better investigate text scams (smishing), House Ways and Means Chair Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda said. During a House Committee on Information and Communications Technology on Wednesday, Sept. 14, Salceda cited the two-decade old law as something the agency could take advantage of.   Republic Act (RA) 8484 of 1998 regulates the use of access devices to prevent fraudulent activity through unauthorized access devices, which “can be used to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value or to initiate a transfer of funds.” “Arguably, online bank accounts and electronic wallets like GCash and Paymaya are access devices, in a reasonable construction of the provision of the law. That means, even without the use of the Cybercrime Law or the Data Privacy Law yet, if we cannot prove that indeed some data hacking was involved, those who perpetrate smishing attacks are still liable under Section 9 (i) (j) or (o) of the law,” Salceda said. Sections (i), (j), and (o) of the law read as follows: “(i) disclosing any information imprinted on the access device, such as, but not limited to, the account number or name or address of the device holder, without the latter’s authority or permission.   “(j) obtaining money or anything of value through the use of an access device, with intent to defraud or with intent to gain and fleeing thereafter. “(o) without the authorization of the issuer of the access device, soliciting a person for the purpose of: offering an access device; or selling information regarding or an application to obtain an access device.” Salceda says that “if smishing attackers are able to access online accounts due to their text scams, they should be guilty of RA 8484, regardless of whether there was a data breach or not”. “Much of our current discussions focus on how the data appearing on the text messages with names of receivers was obtained. That might not necessarily be the most important point now. It is the financial harm that these smishing attacks can cause. And RA 8484 focuses on the potential harm done, so we can really get the ball rolling with investigations,” he concluded.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Even Davao City doesn’t have the means to solve its local problem on classroom shortage. Vice President and concurrent Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Sara Duterte made this admission Wednesday, Sept. 14 as she tried to describe the scale of the classroom deficit in the Philippines. During the House Committee on Appropriations’ consideration of the DepEd’s proposed 2023 budget worth P709 billion, Duterte called for the lifting of a Department of Budget and Management-National Budget Memorandum (DBM-NBM) that would loosen the rule on the funding of classrooms in local government units (LGUs) by the national government.   “We would like to seek your support in our stand of the lifting of the provision for basic education and classroom building in DBM-NBM 138 series of 2021,” Duterte said during the tail end of her presention on the DepEd budget. “This is the order for the DepEd to build only classrooms in the fifth and sixth class municipalities because as a former mayor, I believe even Davao City cannot address the classroom shortage in our city. So hindi po kaya yan, lalung lalo na ng mga (That’s not doable, especially for) 1st to 4th class municipalities,” she said. For perspective, Davao City is not just a normal city; it’s the 8th richest city in the Philippines–something that Duterte repeatedly boasted about during the 2022 poll campaign period. Cities enjoy more progress than municipalities.   Like quicksand “I’ve described our classroom shortage as a situation of a quicksand, which due to meager budgets given to construction annually, we cannot even address the requirements due to enrolment increase and the shortage that keeps piling up year in and year out,” said Duterte, a former multiple term Davao chief executive. She also lamented over how the problems of the local education sector have stuck around unsolved for the years. “Yung problema po natin 10 years ago is problema pa rin natin hanggang ngayon (Our problem 10 years ago is still our problem today). So dapat po (what we should do is) we think outside of the box already with regard to basic education.” The DepEd bared during the hearing that 149,806 classrooms in the country need major repairs. Some 167,901 new classrooms also need to be built in order to address the spike in enrolment, the agency said. Duterte ended her presentation by telling the House members, ” I sincerely thank the members of this committee for listening to our plans for next year and beyond. I know that the challenges we are facing are huge, and we need you support in our quest to think out of the box for our Filipino learners.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The powerful bicameral Commission on Appointments (CA) on Wednesday, September 14 confirmed the appointments of Jesus Crispin Catibayan Remulla and Benjamin de Castro Abalos Jr. as secretaries of the Department of Justice and of the Department of Interior and Local Government, respectively. This followed a public hearing conducted by the CA justice committee chaired by Senator Francis Tolentino and Interior and local government committee chaired by Senator Francis Escudero designed to determine their fitness to be members of the Cabinet of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. There were no opposition to the confirmation of the two secretaries during their first and last public hearing. Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri, concurrent CA chairman, presided over the CA plenary session that confirmed the confirmation of Remulla and Abalos. In endorsing Remulla’s confirmation, Tolentino said the Department of Justice (DOJ) would be in good hands under the leadership of Remulla, Both Tolentino and Remulla are Cavite province residents.   Remulla, a lawyer, was a former congressman and a Cavite governor. He said his appointment by President Marcos as DOJ chief 95 days ago ‘’is every lawyer’s dream to be the DOJ secretary. ‘’ ‘’I’m a man of action. I stand by the Rule of Law,’’ he added. Since he began as DOJ secretary, Remulla said her has started drastic reforms to ensure that the integrity of the nDOJ is kept intact’’ and wants ‘’to leave an efficient justice system.’’ Asked by Tolentino on his thoughts regarding proposals to reimpose the death penalty, Remulla said that ‘’the value of life will always be important for us.’’ He, however, said ‘’policy makers (should) decide on it.’’   Abalos, on the other hand, was a former Mandaluyong City mayor, a former congressmen and former head of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA). He was also the national campaign manager of the President in the last May, 2022 elections. Abalos promised to improve the services of the DILG and its agencies such as the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection, and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. He also said he would push for the improvement of the services of the PNP, particularly in the field of investigation. The public hearing by the CA labor committee on the appointment of Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma was suspended for lack of time. It will resume on Tuesday morning. The questions and answers by Senator Risa Hontiveros and Laguesma on labor issues took so long that CA members had to hurry up Hontiveros because the CA plenary session was being delayed. Hontiveros asked for the suspension of the committee hearing because she still has a long list of labor-related questions that Laguesma has to answer in person. Remulla was asked by Senator Joseph Victor “JV” G. Ejercito on his plans to reform the New Bilibid Prison, which he said, still suffers from the continuous proliferation of illegal drugs and illegal activities committed by syndicates inside the National Penitentiary. “What are your plans Secretary Boying (Remulla)? We have here our senators and congressmen so when the budget season comes, probably we can support the plans of the DOJ Secretary on how we will be able to correct and improve our Bureau of Corrections, the Bilibid in particular,” Ejercito said. Remulla suggested that the government retires the National Bilibid Prison(NBP) in Muntinlupa City and instead build regional penitentiaries across the country. And to avoid immense financial burden, Remulla also suggested that a “lease and transfer” scheme between the local government units (LGU) and the national government be established, wherein LGUs will fund the construction of their regional prisons and the national government will lease said facilities for about 30 years. Hontiveros asked Remulla his views on the entry of foreign nationals, particularly workers of offshore gaming businesses, through the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) visa-upon-arrival (VUA) scheme. During the 18th Congress, the minority senator led the legislative probe on the so-called “pastillas” modus in the implementation of the VUA. “Do you agree, Mr. Secretary, that this scheme has created more opportunities for corruption and has allowed unsavory individuals to enter the country?” Hontiveros asked. She welcomed Remulla’s pitch for structural reforms and modernization in the country’s immigration system. Hontiveros then inquired about the DOJ chief’s position on former Senator Leila de Lima’s cases; proposals to abolish the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG); and the investigation of the International Criminal Court on the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. Hontiveros also secured Remulla’s commitment that the DOJ will comply and implement Republic Act No. 11930 or the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) Law.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Manuel “Lito” Lapid has filed a bill mandating all social media operators to require users to submit a valid proof of identification prior to online registration to facilitate secure and accountable interactions in the internet.   Lapid said such policy would be the key in the fight against disinformation and, at the same time, help build a system of responsibility and accountability across all social media platforms. The senator has earlier filed Senate Bill (S.B.) No. 1289, or the proposed Online and Social Media Membership Accountability Act, wherein all establishments that maintain a social media website are to require their users to submit valid proofs of identification which can be accessed by law enforcers in cases involving criminal acts committed through these sites.   “Layunin natin na mapigilan ng bagong panukala na ito ang sinuman na gumawa ng mga anonymous na account online (This bill primarily seeks to stop anyone who wants to create an anonymous online account),” Lapid said of the bill. “Higit na kailanman, ay kailangan na nating solusyonan at panagutin ang mga trolls na nagpapakalat ng mga peke at maling impormasyon nang kasing bilis ng virus na kinakalaban natin ngayon (Now more than ever, do we need to find solutions and to exact accountability from trolls who disseminate fake and or wrong information faster than the virus we are fighting right now),” Lapid added. He said the bill specifically seeks to mandate the authentication process for all social media platforms through registration of the users’ accounts using any valid government-issued identification and/or barangay certificate.   The measure also compels all social media operators to reveal the identity of those behind fictitious accounts in their platforms. The bill also said Philippine-based users must use or present any government-issued identification cards, including barangay certification of identity as proof of identification. Work and school identification cards may also be used provided they reflect the actual name of the person so identified. Lapid said website users may still use different usernames and have multiple accounts but their membership must still be supported by real identities. Under the bill, the Data Privacy Act applies to all personal information collected by these websites. For existing members, the bill requires operators to require each member to submit a valid identification card as a condition for continuing their membership on their platform. Meanwhile, individuals who will be found to verify their information using fake or falsified proofs of identification shall be punished under this bill.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda today Sept. 14 manifested her support for the proposed 2023 P5.268- trillion National Expenditure Program (NEP), or the President’s budget. ‘’I believe in the rationale presented by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in the National Expenditure Program (NEP) turned over to Congress last August 22 and explained further in the President’s Budget Message, with the theme ‘Agenda for Prosperity: Economic Transformation Towards Inclusivity and Sustainability.’ Legarda issued the statement after senators attended a briefing on the NEP by President Marcos’ economic managers at the Senate building today.   She said she has read and studied both the President’s Budget Message and the National Expenditure Program. ‘’I appreciate that the National Budget, for the first time, is anchored on the Medium Term Fiscal Framework – which our Chair so ably, comprehensively defended on the Floor – and the 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda that serve as the roadmap for economic transformation that the present administration seeks to achieve,’’ she pointed out. Senator Juan Edgardo M. Angara is chairman of the Senate finance committee. ‘’I am one with our economic managers in seeking to achieve the goals of 6.5 to eight percent real GDP (gross domestic product) growth annually between 2023 and 2028, nine percent or single digit poverty rate by 2028 – I hope we can bring it sooner and lower; pagtulungan po natin – three percent National Government (NG) deficit to GDP rate by 2028, less than 60 percent NG debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025, and the ultimate attainment of upper middle income status for Filipinos as presented by our economic team led by Secretary (Benjamin) Diokno,’’ Legarda said.   ‘’After a thorough perusal of the budget, at least in the macro sense, I believe and it is clear to me that it is structured towards the attainment of the goals that you have so aptly set,’’ she stressed. ‘’As such, I believe it is important for us to support these efforts towards economic transformation, inclusivity and sustainability. Therefore, I will not ask any question, Mr. Chair, I have no objections to the 2023 National Expenditure Program in so far as the macro-economic assumptions are concerned, but of course, I will be present in every and each agency’s hearing and posit questions to help the Chair,’’ she added. Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman presented to the members of the committee on finance the highlights of the proposed P5.268 trillion 2023 national budget. Pangandaman said the proposed expenditure program is 4.9 percent higher than this year’s budget and is equivalent to 22.2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. By expense item, personnel services expenditure has the largest share at 31 percent or P1.631 trillion; capital outlays at 18.6 percent or P980.3 billion; allocations to local government units at 18.3 percent or P962.2 billion; maintenance and other operating expenses at 16.6 percent or P873.2 billion; support to government-owned and controlled corporations at 3.7 percent or P195.8 billion; debt burden at 11.6 percent or P611 billion; and tax expenditure fund, 0.3 percent or P14.5 billion.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Alan Peter Cayetano on Wednesday, September 14 urged the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) to probe the possible existence of a syndicate behind the illegal realignment of billions of pesos in funds in the 2023 budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).   As former Speaker of the House, Cayetano said various sources have brought to his attention that there could be a group controlling the allocation of projects to the different congressional districts. What was used to be done at the bicameral level, and usually in smaller amounts, has now become more prevalent and now involves billions of pesos.   “What is more alarming is the possibility that the fund manipulation is happening at the source, meaning the DPWH budget, even before it is submitted to Congress,” Cayetano said. “If reports are true, it has become a corruption pandemic,” the senator lamented. Cayetano dubbed the practice as an “expanded fund parking scheme.”   According to Cayetano the “syndicate” works by slashing the budget of certain congressional districts, and then negotiating its reinstatement in exchange for giving the projects to favored contractors. Cayetano said the budgets of some districts were inexplicably cut in the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP), from as low as 21.41 percent to as high as 93.12 percent. “Ang sumbong sa akin ay binabawasan daw ang budget ng mga distrito, tapos kakausapin nila ang congressman doon na pwede nilang ibalik ang pondo pero sila ang mamimili ng project at contractor nila ang gagawa nito (What they do is they cut the budget of these congressional districts, then they will approach the congressman and promise that they can restore the budget but they would be the ones who will choose the project and their own contractors would be in charge of the project,” he said. “Holdup ang tawag dito (you call that robbery),” the lawmaker said.

Manila Bulletin,"Alleging that Congress is being “remiss” in its duty to safeguard the taxpayers’ money after the House Committee on Appropriations terminated the budget hearing for the P2.3-billion 2023 budget proposal of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) out of courtesy, a member of its Makabayan bloc hit the “practice of servility” that prevent the lawmakers from performing their mandate. House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro on Wednesday, Sept. 14, called on her fellow lawmakers to “stop this practice of servility to the president and the vice president.”   “It should perform its mandate of guarding the hard-earned funds of the people,” she said, adding that Congress “is being reduced as a rubber stamp and a doormat of the executive.” “We need to fulfill our sworn duty to scrutinize the budget because this is one of the main ways to detect abuse and under-utilization of the people’s fund, by just letting the OP (Office of the President) and OVP go without nary a question, then Congress is being remiss of this duty and damaging its own name,” Castro furthered.   Her statement came after the House panel ended in under five minutes the deliberations on the OVP’s proposed budget and did not allow for any questions from the Makabayan bloc, the only members of Congress who were supposed to interpellate during the hearing. Aside from Castro, Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas and Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel were supposed to question Vice President Sara Duterte, who attended the hearing. READ: In just 5 minutes, House panel terminates budget hearing for OVP Castro lamented that the OVP’s budget would go to plenary without being scrutinized at the committee level, especially its “unprecedented P500 million confidential funds.”   She even warned that allowing this to remain unquestioned could pose a national security threat “as even the president is not privy on where and how it would be spent.” “Also aside from the fact that such funds can be used for surveillance and finance a coup against the president because it is a highly secretive type of fund,” the lawmaker said. Castro also expressed dismay over the “burgeoning of operational funds supposedly for ‘Good Governance Engagements and Social Service Projects’“ because it “endangers civilian supremacy because such projects gives excessive entanglement of the military in civilian functions, civilian government.” Castro took the opportunity in her statement to question the Capital Outlay itemized in the OVP’s budget proposal because it was only in 2013 and 2023 when this was funded. Capital outlay refers to the expenditures for the acquisition of assets and their maintenance. The OVP’s proposed budget for capital outlay for 2023 is set at P32.5 million from zero under the current budget. “Such questions have to (be)asked. Besides, these funds can be better utilized if they are realigned to the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), or the Department of Social Work and Development (DSWD),” Castro said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Education (DepEd) under Vice President Sara Duterte is eyeing a “new curriculum” for the controversial K to 12 program for basic education.This was revealed by Duterte, the concurrent education secretary, during the House Committee on Appropriations’ deliberation Wednesday, Sept. 13 on DepEd’s proposed budget for 2023. Before this, Duterte confirmed to the House panel that DepEd’s review of the K to 10 program, which covers pupils in Kindergarten to Grade 10, has been finished. “We’re actually done with the review,” Duterte said. A solon had asked the DepEd contingent about the K to 12 program, which was implemented during the time of the late President Benigno S. Aquino III. K to 12 added two years to the basic education system.   “We are currently presenting it (K to 10), we initially presented it to the mancom, execom and then we will present it to other sectors. And from the government and the private sector as well,” said Duterte. “And we are currently starting with the review on Grades 11 to 12 and it will go through the same process [as the K-10 review],” she added. “It will go through presentations so that comments and suggestion from all the sectors can be collated by the [DepEd] and we come up with the new curriculum for the K to 12 program,” she further said. “However, during our discussions it will take two to three years for a new, for us to implement a new curriculum for the K to 12 and I was, and I’m trying to push the curriculum and instruction to do in one year,” the DepEd chief said. Speaking to the solons, Duterte said: “We will update you on that if we will be able to implement a new curriculum in a year or two. We’re talking about academic school year.” Duterte is the eldest daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte.",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said there was no reason for him to revise history, particularly in the era when their family was infamously linked, since he recognized the problems and abuses that happened back then. Marcos said this in his interview with one of his biggest supporters, TV host and actress Toni Gonzaga, aired over ALLTV on his 65th birthday on September 13.   During the interview, Marcos addressed the issue constantly being hurled at him. Critics have been accusing him of using his return to Malacañang to bury the atrocities that happened when his late namesake father, former President Ferdinand Marcos, declared Martial Law. According to the President, there was no reason to revise history since his family recognized the dark side of his father’s regime. “We recognize naman the problems that happened, the abuses that occurred like in any war. All of these things are some things that are already part of history,” he said. “We have no—there’s no reason to revise history,” he added.   Amnesty International’s data showed there were over 3,200 extrajudicial killings during Martial Law. There were also about 70,000 who were imprisoned and 35,000 who were tortured. In an interview with TV host Boy Abunda early this year, Marcos said the international watchdog should share their data. “Let us ask Amnesty International to share that information that they have, and maybe it will help us make sure that the system works and what alleged abuses occurred should not occur again,” he said in January. “I think that’s the only way that we can remedy that situation,” he added. Meanwhile, President Marcos said in Tuesday’s interview that he has no intention of changing textbooks, although he might still do so if “they’re wrong.” “Only if they’re wrong. Factual naman, eh (They’re factual anyway),” he said.   “You can check facts. Let’s talk about facts, not political opinion,” he added. Marcos, however, reiterated that his family could prove all their claims. “Lahat ng aming sinasabi kaya naming patunayan. Kaya paano nagiging revision of history (We can prove everything we’ve said. So how is that a revising history)?” he said. Earlier, Marcos’ sister, Senator Imee Marcos, rejected allegations that their family was seeking to revise history, saying they just wanted to “tell their side of the story.”  ",0

Sonny Angara, that the Marcos administration is committed to pursue a “robust economy, inclusive and resilient society” by protecting the purchasing power of families, and creating more jobs to boost employment. State economic managers also assured that the government is right on track in reducing the country’s vulnerability from the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure sound macroeconomic fundamentals.   “The economic team’s proposed 2023 budget will fortify the country’s bid for a strong recovery and accelerated growth,” Diokno said during the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) briefing presided by Angara. “With capable leaders and a robust economic plan, we are confident that we will achieve the Marcos administration’s bold socio-economic agenda,” Diokno further said. Aside from Diokno, also present during the hearing were Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman and National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan.   Diokno also presented an overview of the country’s medium-term fiscal plan and the legislative priorities of the government, as well as the current state of the country’s economy and updates on fiscal performance snd borrowings. After listening to the presentations of the country’s fiscal managers, Angara welcomed increases in the budgets of education, health, and agriculture. He also noted an increase in the government’s calamity fund despite the small increase in the 2023 national budget. “Whether it is enough, that is something that we will discover. We will be debating (on the 2023 national budget) in the coming days and weeks,” Angara said. Next year’s budget is slightly higher than this year’s budget which is P5.024-trillion.    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. believes that with the creative industry, the government is on track in its journey to lift the economy and save jobs after years of pandemic-induced lockdowns. Marcos said this in his interview with one of his biggest supporters, TV host and actress Toni Gonzaga, aired over ALLTV on his 65th birthday on September 13.   According to Marcos, the “creative industry” is vital to job creation and economic development. “If you go around Asia, and you go to the hotels, you go to the bars, ang tumutugtog laging Pilipino’ ‘di ba (Filipinos are the ones playing, right)?” he noted. “We have a, somehow, a special affinity to the performing arts,” he added. With this, the President said his administration is focused on bringing the “Filipino brand” to the global stage and making it well-known.   Marcos recalled how Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco would encourage him to make the Filipino brand important and well-known. “She’s absolutely right,” he said. “Part of that brand is our culture. And it’s not something that’s going to be hard. The Filipino brand is attractive. The Filipino brand is singular, is unique,” he added. Asked about what for him is the Filipino brand, Marcos said: “If I have to describe it in one word, it’s grace.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. seemed not to have made up his mind yet about the death penalty, saying it remains a sensitive topic that involves both practical and moral issues. Marcos said this in his interview with one of his biggest supporters: TV host and actress Toni Gonzaga aired over ALLTV on his 65th birthday on September 13.   According to the President, he was having a hard time taking a stand on the death penalty. “The death penalty is a tough one because there is a practical issue and a moral issue involved,” he said. “And the question is, does society have the right to kill its own people? And that’s a tough one to get around,” he added. Marcos likewise raised the question if bringing back the death penalty would actually work in discouraging crimes.   “As a practical matter, does the death penalty, actually, does it discourage people from committing heinous crimes? And I think the data, not only from the Philippines but from other countries, shows that we have to be very stringent about applying the law,” he said. Marcos’ predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, never missed calling on Congress to bring back the death penalty after it was scrapped twice since the creation of the 1987 Constitution. Congress, however, did not deliver on Duterte’s call. The 1987 Constitution allows Congress to bring back capital punishment for heinous crimes. It was revived during the Ramos administration but was scrapped again under the Arroyo administration. Under the Duterte Administration, the House Majority bloc voted to exclude plunder, rape, and treason from the list of crimes punishable with death. The exclusion is supposed to help them arrive at a compromise after some lawmakers remained hesitant about voting in favor of House Bill No. 4727.   In 2017, President Duterte wondered why Congress decided to exclude plunder and rape from the list of crimes punishable by death under the said House Bill. Duterte said that while he did not say he would not kill plunderers or corrupt officials, rape is still one of the most heinous crimes that should merit the heaviest penalty. Malacañang had said that the reimposition of capital punishment is an important component in maintaining a crime-free and drug-free Philippines.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"“You give us too much credit.” This was how President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. reacted to claims that his path to the presidency was a long-term plan.   During his interview with television host Toni Gonzaga, Marcos belied such claims, saying it was never his dream to be a president. “Natatawa ako kung minsan (I laugh sometimes when) I see the commentary “pinagplanuhan nila nang taon-taon ito (they planned it for years), it’s a long-term plan,” Marcos said. “I’d like to talk to them and say you know you give us too much credit. If only you knew all the stumbling blocks that came in our way, all the mistakes that we made,” Marcos added. The President was referring to claims that he has made his way to the presidency through well-planned disinformation and propaganda. Growing up watching his father rule the country for 20 years, Marcos said he once told himself he will never enter the political arena and the presidency was never his goal. But he eventually became President after serving as a governor and senator. “Ako naman sinasabi ko hindi na ako papasok diyan (As for me, I said I would never enter that). In fact, umiiwas talaga ako sa pulitika, e (I was avoiding politics),” he said. “Well, circumstances are what they are, I ended up here. Para sa akin hindi yung ano, eh gusto kong maging presidente kahit na anong mangyari basta ‘yan lang ang gagawin ko sa buong buhay ko magpi-presidente ako (for me, it’s not: I want to be a president so whatever it takes I will only be aspiring for that). It was never like that,” he added. Now that he has won the presidency, Marcos believes it was watching his father lead the country that prepared him to be one. “[I]t’s very much playing a familiar role but you never played it before. I was never president before. But I watched my father for a very long time so “ah ganyan ang presidente (ah, that is how to be a president),” Marcos said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Marcos, who heads the Department of Agriculture (DA) in a concurrent capacity, said he will initiate to include rice allowance in the salary of government workers.   In an interview with Toni Gonzaga, he said such allowance will be given in the form of rice to ensure that government workers and their families will have enough rice in their homes. “I’m going to initiate in our, at least for the government workers, the rice allowance, nabibigay part of the sweldo (will be given as part of their salary). Ang pagbayad is in rice para nakakatiyak tayo, everybody, every family will have rice (The payment will be in the form of rice to ensure that everybody, every family will have rice),” said Marcos.   However, the chief executive did not disclose his target date to fully implement his plan. Marcos said the rice that will be given to them will be from the government so it will cost cheaper. “And this will be bought by the government, from the government para makamura tayo (for us to get it at a lower price) and the people don’t have to buy the market price,” he said.   “Now, we don’t want to put the rice producers out of business. On the contrary, what’s going to happen is magkakaroon ng demand kasi bibili nang marami ‘yung gobyerno, eh (there will be a demand because the government will purchase a lot of rice),” he continued. Marcos said he will talk to corporations as he wants to institutionalize the inclusion of rice allowance in workers’ pay. “So we will institutionalize it, so at the very least mayroon tayong ganoon (we have that). This is life and death and the people are living very close to the subsistence level, and we have to pull ourselves out of that,” he said. “They should not be at the subsistence level, they should not be spending 60, 70, 80 percent of their income on food. That’s far, far too much.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. did not talk about the war on drugs in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) because it is “of internal matter” and it will take a whole SONA to discuss it, he said. He may have not included it in his first SONA, but Marcos reiterated his previous statement that the anti-illegal drug campaign initiated by the previous administration will continue under his term but in a different way.   He also explained his reason for opting out the agenda from his speech. “I didn’t because I had already explained it and I think it’s of an internal matter,” he said during an interview with television host Toni Gonzaga on Toni Talks. “The war on drugs will continue but we have to do it in a different way. Until we formulate fully our policies,” he added. The President also said that policies are already being formulated and it would “take another whole SONA just to explain” it.   Marcos bared that there is currently a working group putting together the policies for the implementation of his administration’s anti-illegal drug campaign. “Even as we speak, there are a working group putting together… They knew war on drugs. We are looking more for in the upstream, upstream of the problem, the prevention,” he said. The Chief Executive said they are currently formulating “the best way for the rehabilitation” and other areas of the campaign such as the enforcement side.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The bill seeking the mandatory registration of all Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards in the country is making headway in the Senate again. This, after Senator Grace Poe sponsored Committee Report No. 5, submitted jointly the Senate Public Services panel, committees on science and technology, banks, financial institutions and currencies, trade, commerce and entrepreneurship of Senate Bill No. 1310.   SB No. 1310 is a consolidated version of the various measures pending in the Senate that seeks to deter ill-intentioned scammers and criminals from further hiding under the shadow of anonymity. “This bill is a concrete step towards making our telecommunications and digital system a safer environment for all, as had been the hope of the 18th Congress when it previously passed the measure,” said Poe in her sponsorship speech on Tuesday, September 13.   “We are not alone in wanting this kind of policy. Globally, the trend skews heavily in favor of SIM registration: A total of 157 countries have adopted laws that require mandatory SIM registration, including nations with the highest regard for data privacy rights,” said the chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services. Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, co-sponsor of the measure, said he is confident passage of the bill into law will help not only in crime investigation and help law enforcement agencies but also improve the government’s cyber-defense capabilities as well. “These text scams and spams surpass a mere breach of privacy and safeguard from intrusions! This is already a threat to our mobile and cyberspace integrity and safety that has been going on for two decades already,” Estrada said, also in his co-sponsorship speech on the bill.   Estrada noted that as early as 2001, law enforcement agencies have called for the institutionalization of the registration of prepaid SIM cards as a crime prevention strategy. “I am fully on board with this urgent and important mission,” he said. “It is high time that we give SIM card registration legislation a chance to be enacted into law to save lives and prevent these swindlers from continuously victimizing unsuspecting individuals by sucking in their hard-earned money to deceptive offers from text scammers,” the lawmaker added. Congress has already passed the proposed SIM Card Registration Act during the 18th Congress but then President Duterte vetoed the measure. Martin Andanar, Duterte’s spokesman at that time, said the President was “constrained to disagree with the inclusion of social media in the measure, without providing proper guidelines and definitions.” Poe said she is optimistic of the bill getting the Marcos administration’s approval this time. In fact, she said the word “card” in “SIM card” has been dropped “to make way for newer types of SIM that are not contained in card form, such as eSIM.” “We are future-proofing a regulation that deals with technology to ensure that this law will adapt to the creative ways of fraudsters,” Poe said. She underscored that the bill institutionalizes the necessary measures to guarantee data protection and privacy of citizens. Under the bill, telecommunication companies or Telcos would be tasked to keep the submitted information safe and secure in a centralized database. To ensure the protection of consumers’ data and to keep the Telcos in check, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is mandated to perform an annual audit of the telcos’ compliance with the proper information security standards. “Heavy emphasis is placed on the absolute confidentiality of submitted information, and disclosure is only allowed upon a court order or subpoena, or with the consent of the subscriber, or in compliance with the Data Privacy Act,” Poe said. “Any breach of confidentiality will be punished,” she added. Though the measure is “not the panacea to all the ills and evils proliferating in the telecommunications system,” Poe emphasized that its enactment into law would certainly be a step forward in addressing rampant SIM-aided fraud in the country.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. maintained his stand to not rejoin the International Criminal Court (ICC), saying he does not see any reason why the Philippines should. During his interview with television host and one of his biggest supporters Toni Gonzaga on Tuesday, Sept. 13, Marcos explained why he thinks the country does not need to join the ICC or even allow it to investigate the alleged human rights violations here.   “I don’t see any reason why we should. The ICC is, very simply, supposed to take actions when a country no longer has a functioning judiciary, has no longer some of the organs of the state, the police, etc. And that condition does not exist in the Philippines so I do not see what role ICC is going to play here in the Philippines,” Marcos said. Although he did not categorically reject the proposal to resume investigation on the war on drugs, the President said the country does not need the ICC to investigate the crimes committed here. He expressed distaste on a possible order of the ICC to arrest someone in the country as a result of its investigation. “Think about it, we will allow them to come in and investigate and tell us who to arrest. Mag-iimbestiga sila dito, tutulungan natin silang mag-imbestiga. Pagkatapos ng imbestigasyon sasabihin ikulong ninyo si ganito, ikulong ninyo si ganyan (They will investigate here, we will help them. And after that, they will tell us to arrest this person, arrest that person),” Marcos said.   “There is no need for them to come into the Philippines,” he added. “The alleged crimes were all committed in the Philippines, they were all committed by Filipinos, why will we need a foreigner to tell us how to deal with it? I don’t think we do, I don’t think we need,” the President pointed out. Only a state of war or a collapsing government system would prompt him to change his mind, he also said. The Chief Executive has made a pronouncement that the country has no intention to rejoin the ICC in August as investigation on the drug-related crimes committed in the previous administration’s war on drugs was already ongoing. On Sept. 8, the Philippine government formally asked the ICC to deny the proposal to resume investigation on the alleged war on drugs-related crimes, saying “the ICC has no jurisdiction over the situation in the Philippines.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Amid the 6.1 percent inflation rate reported for the month of June, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. believes the country has “done all right” in terms of monetary policy. The President made the pronouncement in an interview aired on All TV, where he also blamed the “imported inflation” to be the cause of inflation now being suffered in the Philippines. “Doon sa pinanggalingan nya, tumaas ang presyo ng natural gas, tumaas ang presyo ng ammonia (From where they came from, gas prices, ammonia prices already increased). All of the elements that go into it…naisama mo na ‘yung inflation nya eh. Ganon na ang mundo ngayon eh (inflation has been priced in. That’s how the world works now),” he said.    The President also reasoned that there is an imported inflation because the world is “very interconnected.” “You cannot deal anymore without talking to other countries, trading with other countries, getting supply from other countries,” he said. Those were the same reasons why the President, in fact, does not “want to recover [the] economy to what it was in 2019,” but instead “to transform the economy to get ready for the shocks, the difficulties” of the future. “So we just have to pay close attention to what’s happening around us and what we do in response,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Amid the ongoing pandemic, the Philippines, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s administration, does not have an appointed Department of Health (DOH) secretary yet because the agency’s job is not only about dealing with Covid-19. This was according to Marcos himself after he was asked in an interview aired on ALLTV why there is no appointed DOH chief yet.   “We have to remember that the DOH is not about Covid alone. It’s about public health in general, so that’s another side of it. And it’s as important as Covid is,” he said. Marcos Jr. said, “there are many other elements to the DOH,” and that was why the government has to keep functioning “until we finalize the structure.” “We have the dengue rates are climbing. We have the second highest HIV rate of infection in the world,” he cited as some of the reasons. “The consultants that are helping us, putting the new structure of the DOH together, diyan manggagaling yung ating bagong secretary (That’s where our new secretary will come from),” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva on Tuesday, September 13 said the Senate should look into what is the cause of the simultaneous, forced, and unplanned outages of several power plants in the Luzon Grid, which led to the red alert in power supply and the rotating brownouts. ‘’This happened despite the DOE (Department of Energy) assuring us during the September 6 hearing of the Senate committee on energy that the Luzon grid can meet the power demand until October,’’ he said.   Villanueva strongly suggested that the Executive branch initiate short-term adjustments to prevent similar shortages from happening in the next year or so. ‘’As for medium- to long-term solutions, we expect the DOE to lay out its plans to root out and solve this problem. Definitely, this issue will be brought up during the budget deliberations on DOE’s 2023 budget,’’ he said. ‘’On the part of the legislature, we will study how we can further promote renewable energy sources for the country to prevent supply shortages in the future,’’ he added. Reacting to the power outages in Luzon, Senator Juan Edgardo ‘’Sonny’’ M. Angara, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said that the country faced a similar problem in the 1990s.   ‘’We should see how to incentivise and speed up the building of new power plants,’’ he added.

Manila Bulletin,"The 24-member Senate on Tuesday, September 13 adopted a resolution honoring 10 Filipinos recognized by Metrobank Foundation this year for their excellence in their respective fields.   This after Senator Grace Poe has enjoined the nation in honoring 10 Filipinos recognized by Metrobank Foundation this year for their excellence in their respective fields. “For those of us who have been working in government, these outstanding Filipinos inspire us to be the best version of ourselves. They have gone beyond the call of duty, motivated by the burning desire to improve the quality of life in their communities and to ignite the hope that our nation needs as we recover from the pandemic,” Poe said in her sponsorship speech on Senate Resolution 106. Eight other senators stood up in today’s plenary session presided by Semite President Juan Miguel Zubiri to co-sponsor the resolution. They were Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda, Majority Leader Joel Villanueva and Senators Nancy Binary, Sherwin Gatchalian, Ronald dela Rosa, Pia S. Cayetano, Ramon Revilla Jr. and Christopher ‘’Bong’’ Go.   “Meeting these modern-day heroes—trailblazers, courageous, patriotic and excellent public servants is truly an honor,” Poe said. A Metrobank Foundation Outstanding Filipino award is conferred upon teachers, soldiers and police officers who are recognized as models of excellence in their profession and are active agents of positive change. Poe, who served as chairperson of the final board of judges in Metrobank’s search this year, thanked the foundation for providing a venue for public servants to be commended and become inspiration to others. “Though it was challenging to limit the awardees, I believe the board of judges chose fairly bearing in mind this award’s battle cry of ‘beyond excellence’,” Poe said. The 10 awardees consist of four teachers Junmerth Jorta, Christine Joy Dr. Aguila, Mark Nolan Confesor and Leonila Dans; three soldiers Technical Sgt. Joel Tuganan, Col. Maria Victoria Juan and Col. Stephen Cabanlet; and three police officers Police Executive Master Sgt. Rogelio Rodriguez Jr., Police Capt. Rosalino Panlaqui and Police Col. Lambert Suerte. On Tuesday, they visited the Senate together with officials of the foundation.   “We are grateful to have in our midst these outstanding Filipinos who have shown dedication in the performance of their duties and responsibilities beyond reproach, and for being model citizens in their respective communities,” Poe said.

Manila Bulletin,"The two-manned Senate minority bloc on Tuesday released their own “minority report” on the sugar importation fiasco countering several of the findings and recommendations of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on the controversial release of Sugar Order No. 4 which Malacañang eventually disowned. In particular, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said they disagree with the recommendation of the panel to file criminal and administrative charges against former undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian and the three other executives in the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) in connection to their involvement in the controversial release of Sugar Order No. 4.   Last August, President Marcos disowned the release of S.O. No. 4 which could have authorized the entry of 300,000 metric tons (MT) into the country. Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, who was privy to Marcos’ request for a sugar importation plan, had insisted that the move was illegal as the resolution had no approval of the Chief Executive, who is also concurrently the secretary of agriculture. Pimentel pointed out that at the onset of the Senate committee hearings on the sugar importation fiasco, there is “evidence of good faith” on the part of Sebastian, former Sugar Regulatory Board (SRB) member Roland Beltran, former board member Aurelio Gerardo Valderma and former Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) administrator Hermenegildo Serafica. All four officials, signatories to the document, have quit from their posts since the sugar importation fiasco snowballed.   Sen. Francis Tolentino, chair of the blue ribbon panel, earlier reported out the committee report recommending the filing of mulitple charges against the four former officials, particularly for violation of Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. But Pimentel said there is enough evidence that the four officials prepared and signed S.O. No. 4 in “good faith” and were even present during the meetings that were evidently organized by the Executive Secretary. “The Minority would like to point out that there were clearly badges of good faith on the part of USec. Sebastian, Administrator Serafica, and Board Members Beltran and Valderrama that the Committee Report apparently failed to notice and give importance to,” the minority senators said in the 17-paged report. “Aside from the fact that there was no evidence of an intention to conceal the execution of SO No. 4 from the President, the sworn affidavits and the testimonies of the four key persons made during the public hearings are consistent in their assertion that they only did their job and what they believed were required of them at that given time,” they said. Pimentel and Hontiveros also said the recommendation of the majority to initiate adminstrative and criminal charges against them and to issue a look out bulletin “are lacking factual and legal basis.” “These are human beings ah, with careers, reputation and families…the treatment is undeserved, uncalled for, and unjustified,” Pimentel said. The minority senators also said the Blue Ribbon Committee Report “failed, or purposefully refrained, to discuss the part which ES Rodriguez played in this unfortunate debacle.” Rodriguez, they said, was insinuating that there was an intent on behalf of the SRA board members to conceal the execution of SO No. 4 froom the President, but the testimonies during the hearings and sworn affidavits submitted clearly established that all documents, including the planning and drafting of the sugar order, recommendations, were promptly communicated to the Office of the President through the Office of the Executive Secretary. Pimentel pointed out “he (Rodriguez) also admitted he purposely did not answer” Sebastian. “By virtue of his position, Executive Secretary Rodriguez has a direct link to the President. He stands as the gatekeeper to the President,” they said. The minority senators added: “There would not have been any miscommunication had the Executive Secretary simply replied that the SRA Board should give the President more time to study the ‘draft’ SO No. 4 and to hold in abeyance the planned referendum pending advice or instruction from the Office of the President.” “It was clear to us early on that all communications related to the issuance of S.O. No. 4 were timely and clearly communicated to the Executive Secretary. However, the Executive Secretary’s unilateral decision to sit on it contributed to the debacle,” Hontiveros said, during a press briefing. She also called the recommendation to file criminal and administrative charges against the four officials to be “disproportionately punitive.” “Walang basehan at hindi makatarungan kung kakasuhan pa sila. Hindi dapat pinagdidiskitahan ng administrasyon ang mga empleyado ng gobyerno na ginagawa lang naman ang trabaho nila (There is no basis and it is an injustice if they are going to face cases just for this. The administration should not be threatening government employees who are just doing their job),” she said. Asked why the minority report did not recommend any charges to be filed against Rodriguez, Pimentel said they have opted not to and would just like to appeal to other senators to “let this be on their conscience” instead. “Wala, di na kami nag recommend ng charges against Rodriguez. Let it be na lang. Let this be on their conscience na lang. And this is addressed to the majority,” Pimentel said. “We will cross-examine them (majority senators) when they decide to charge the four personalities,” he said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Marcos signed an executive order (EO) imposing a year-long moratorium on payments on the annual amortization and interest payments of agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) for agricultural lands distributed under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) said. The order seeks to relieve the ARBs of their debts, allowing them to use the money to develop their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce and propelling the economy’s growth.   According to Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III, the EO is in preparation for “another fulfillment” of the chief executive’s commitment, which is for Congress to pass legislation that will forgive ARB loans with unpaid amortization and interest. “We always think about the farmers’ welfare. The one-year moratorium and condonation of farmers’ loan payment will lead to freedom of farmers from debts,” he said in a statement.   He expressed his willingness to work with the House of Representatives to amend Section 26 of Republic Act 6657, also known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988. In his first State of the Nation Address (SONA), Marcos said: “The condonation of the existing agrarian reform loan will cover the amount of P58.125 billion benefiting around 654,000 ARBs and involving a total of 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands.” Section 26 of Republic Act 6657 requires ARBs who have been awarded lands to pay the Land Bank of the Philippines in 30 annual amortizations at a rate of six percent per year.   Marcos said the proposed law would forgive ARB loans with unpaid amortization and interest and erase the outstanding debts of farmers who benefit from agrarian reform. “ARBs who are still to receive their awarded lands under the CARP shall receive it without obligation to pay any amortization,” said the President. Marcos also heads the Department of Agriculture in a concurrent capacity.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robinhood “Robin” C. Padilla said medical marijuana could play a key role in funding major government programs that would benefit all Filipinos. Padilla stressed this yesterday as the Senate prepares to tackle the proposed national budget for 2023 starting September 14. In a privilege speech, Padilla also said it is necessary to find other sources of revenue, especially since many government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) depend on the government for their yearly budget. It is time to stop this “milking cow phenomenon,” he added. “As we plan how to spend our limited funds wisely, let us not forget the hard-earned contributions of our taxpayers. In this light, we must boost the economy and this is where medical cannabis can play a major role),” Padilla said.   “Panahon na po para tayo naman ang magpunla ng sariling atin. Tandaan po: kapag may itinanim, may aanihin (It is time for us to maximize our own. What we sow, we reap),” he added. For the 2023 national budget, Padilla noted that while the government has drawn up various programs to create jobs, invest in infrastructure and digitalization, and set up other projects in line with its eight-point socioeconomic agenda, all these programs need P5.268 trillion in funding – with only P3.632 trillion from revenues and P2.207 trillion from borrowings. ‘’If we have to borrow to fund our programs, should we not look for other sources of funds – other than adding taxes? With medical marijuana, ‘Don’t panic, it’s organic’),” he said. Padilla noted the economy is one of the main reasons he is pushing for the passage of his Senate Bill 230 that would allow legal access to medical cannabis – aside from its benefits to health. Because of this, he proposed that his speech be referred to the Senate committee on ways and means to explore the economic viability, feasibility and benefits of medical cannabis to the Philippines. On the other hand, Padilla noted many GOCCs have lost money – in 2021, subsidies to 80 GOCCs reached P212 billion, but these GOCCs generated only P38 billion or 18 perent in dividends. He lamented the GOCCs had net losses of some P33 billion.   Among the highly subsidized GOCCs with little dividends are the National Food Authority (NFA), Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), National Electrification Authority, National Power Corporation (Napocor), Philippine Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), Philippine Tax Academy, Southern PH Development Authority, and Tourism Promotions Board, he said. ‘’We realize these corporations have a mandate toward public service and they are not expected to prioritize making money. But we expect them to at least have fiscal discipline and transparency. We need to stop this milking cow phenomenon where they just depend on the government for their budget,” he pointed out. ‘’It is a painful reality that we always draw funds from our coffers. Many of our government owned and controlled corporations depend on government funds for subsidies, equity and net lending but give little if any in return. In 2023, we will fork out P195.8 billion for these GOCCs without the promise of a return of investment that will benefit our people,” he said. ‘’It is time that we consider other ways to raise needed revenues,” he added. The lawmaker pointed out that in Asia alone – with 4.5 billion people – the Philippines can have an advantage since the cannabidiol content of cannabis grown here is higher compared to neighboring countries. He noted that in 2021, medical cannabis accounted for some $37.4 billion worldwide – and in Asia which is starting to open its doors to the cannabis industry, $158.9 million or P8.7 billion is spent for medical cannabis in Israel in 2020 alone. In Thailand alone where the use of medical marijuana was legalized just four years ago, the market for medical cannabis is estimated at $79 million for 2021 alone. ‘’There are so many possibilities for medical marijuana to contribute to our economy – especially for the Philippines that needs much funding,” said Padilla. Meanwhile, Padilla pointed out the health benefits of medical cannabis, based on 29,802 publications on the matter – including US studies from 2016 to 2019, showing cannabis has “moderate to high quality of evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety” in medical conditions where its use is allowed. He pointed out as well that the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs removed cannabis from the list of dangerous drugs in December 2020, even as cannabis has been used as medicine for more than 3,000 years. Also, he said the medical use of cannabis has been legal in 70 countries, with 4.4 million patients with access to legal cannabis products – yet these do not include Filipinos.    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"It will take six months to one year before the administration of President Bongbong Marcos, Jr. is stabilized, the country’s top cop said in explaining viral videos of criminal incidents, which he said, are part of the agenda of the detractors. Police Gen. Rodolfo Azurin, Jr., chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said he himself told the Marcos of the prevailing situation involving the latter’s firm hold of the presidency. “I have already foreseen this. That’s why I told the President that we need six months to one year to stabilize his administration because we are expecting that since there was as shift to leadership on the way things are handled, so definitely the detractors are not very happy,” said Azurin.   Since Azurin assumed the top PNP post last month, he has been struggling to handle viral videos of kidnappings and other criminal incidents which he described to be part of the agenda to project that the peace and order situation in the country is weak. He said that based on the investigation they conducted, almost all of those which went viral in the social media are criminal incidents that happened months and years before. Last week, a group of businessmen said there were 56 kidnapping incidents that happened in just a span of 10 days but the police disputed it and said there were only 27 cases that occurred since January this year, almost all are related to the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). “As a matter of fact, those crimes (that went viral) were cases that have already been resolved. I really don’t know what’s the intention of posting them again because if they think they are hurting the PNP in posting, they are not hurting only the PNP but they are hurting the economy of this country,” said Azurin.   “So these are all part of the distractions,” he added. Azurin then appealed to those posting old videos to refrain from doing so and instead help the government in improving the economy.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III today Sept. 12 voted ‘’no’’ to a concurrent resolution supporting the 2022-2028 Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) of the national government.   Pimentel said voting in favor of this concurrent resolution ‘’is the complete antithesis of my role as the minority leader”. ‘’To commit myself to the contents of the resolution and the attached MTFF is to abdicate my parliamentary duty to fiscalize and check the validity of proposals and ideas on the floor of the Senate on a case-to-case basis,’’ he pointed out. ‘’One last point. The subject resolution is replete with formal and procedural inaccuracies,’’ he added. Pimentel said voting in favor of the resolution is a commitment from the voter to support the 21-page MTFF which ‘’contains macroeconomic objectives, fiscal plans, and legislative measures pre-determined by the Executive Branch”.   He emphasised that an affirmative vote could amount to a wholesale surrender to the following legislative measures: (1) Annual Budget or the General Appropriations Act; (2) Budget Modernization Bill; (3) National Government Rightsizing Program; (4) Imposition of VAT on digital service providers; (5) Taxation of income generated by online content   creators; (6) Imposition of excise tax on single-use plastics; (7) Government Pension Reform bills; and (8) Other fiscal strengthening measures that are identified to complement the objectives of the MTFF. ‘’And all these lack sufficient details in the present form of the MTFF to support an intelligible and well-informed decision on the matter,’’ he pointed out. ‘’To commit myself to the contents of the resolution and the attached MTFF is to abdicate my parliamentary duty to fiscalize and check the validity of proposals and ideas on the floor of the Senate on a case-to-case basis,’’ he added. “It is my position that this measure should not have followed the procedure for concurrent resolutions and that legislative work should have started at the committee level and not in plenary. If the chosen legislative form is inaccurate, the legislative procedure followed is wrong and, therefore, the result arrived at is defective,’’ he stressed.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Supreme Court (SC) has dismissed the petition filed by an anti-corruption group against the alleged illegality and unconstitutionality of the Land Transportation Office’s (LTO) P836 million contract in 2017 for drivers’ plastic license cards. In a decision written by Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, the SC ruled that the Anti-Trapo Movement (ATM), which filed the petition, has no legal standing to question the deal between the LTO and NEXTIX, Dermalog Identification Systems, and CFP Strategic Transaction Advisors Joint Venture (Dermalog) for the procurement of more than eight million plastic drivers’ license cards with a five-year validity. The SC pointed out that even if the procedural defects would be ignored, the petition should still be dismissed as the LTO did not commit grave abuse of discretion in awarding the contract to Dermalog. At the same time, the SC stressed that “even before the petition was filed before this Court, a notice to proceed has already been issued in favor of Dermalog directing it to proceed with the project within seven days upon issuance of the receipt of notice.”   “Injunctive remedies do not lie against ‘acts already accomplished,’” it said. “While a substantial amount of public funds was involved in the procurement of driver’s license cards, petitioner (ATM) fell short of establishing that respondent (LTO) blatantly disregarded relevant constitutional and statutory prohibitions in awarding the contract to Dermalog,” the SC said. Also, the SC said that “the Court will only exercise the power of judicial review if the action is brought by ‘a party who has legal standing to raise the constitutional or legal question.’” ATM told the SC that it filed the petition to protect the government from an anomalous contract, which is “manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the Filipino people.” It said that LTO gravely abused its direction when it awarded the contract to Dermalog after the lowest bidder, Banner Plasticard, Inc., was disqualified for being non-responsive to the bid requirements. It claimed that the LTO failed to resolve Banner’s plea for reconsideration before awarding the contract to Dermalog.   It pointed out that the cost of a single driver’s license card is P89.71 under Banner’s bid, while the cost under Dermalog’s bid is P99.16, which is higher by 10.53 percent. Since 8.36 million driver’s license cards are required to be produced, the difference between the two costs would amount to P79,668,053.55, it stressed. The overpriced cost, it said, would have to be shouldered by Filipino drivers. On the procedural aspect, the SC explained that legal standing pertains to “a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged.” The SC junked ATM’s allegation that the issues it raised involved “transcendental public importance,” which is one of the exceptions to the rule on legal standing. It said ATM’s claim of transcendental importance must be backed by proper allegations as its plain invocation does not suffice for the Court to set aside procedural technicalities. The submission by Banner of the lowest calculated bid does not automatically warrant an award of the contract in its favor, considering that it was found noncompliant during the mandatory post qualification, the SC said. “ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED,” the SC ruled.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Department of National Defense (DND) Officer in Charge Jose Faustino Jr. has praised the “robust” defense relations between the Philippines and Thailand as he expressed intent to further enhance it amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Faustino conveyed this message to Thailand Ambassador to the Philippines Tull Traisorat during the latter’s courtesy call in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City last Sept. 9.   DND spokesperson Arsenio Andolong said that Faustino and Traisorat’s meeting centered on the bilateral defense relations of Manila and Bangkok, and how the two countries were able to keep their lines of communication open amid the pandemic. “The two officials discussed the status of bilateral defense relations, potential areas of cooperation, ways ahead for logistics and defense industry collaboration, and multilateral cooperation. The OIC, DND commended the robust defense relations between the Philippines and Thailand for sustaining dialogue despite the ongoing pandemic,” Andolong said on Monday, Sept. 12. “Furthermore, both officials welcomed the possible cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), as well as the activities/meetings for the upcoming 2022 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit to be hosted by Thailand, and the 75th anniversary of Philippines-Thailand diplomatic relations in 2024,” he added. Accordingly, Faustino welcomed the convening of high-level meetings and the conduct of various defense and military activities between the two countries.   He also underscored that exchanges of best practices with Thailand “have contributed to addressing common defense and security challenges” particularly terrorism and internal security concerns. Meanwhile, Faustino backed Thailand’s co-chairmanship of the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)-Plus Experts’ Working Group (EWG) on Maritime Security from 2021 to 2024 along with the United States. The ADMM-Plus is the official framework of defense minister’s meetings in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a component of the ADMM, the highest defense consultative and cooperative mechanism in ASEAN, which allows member-countries to coordinate with eight dialogue partners namely Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States to “strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace, stability, and development in the region.” For his part, Traisorat agreed that information sharing remains one of the key elements of military collaboration between both countries. Andolong said that the Thai envoy encouraged the sustainment of strong and active defense relations between Manila and Bangkok, including logistics and defense industry cooperation and partnership under the auspices of ASEAN. “The Ambassador also conveyed Thailand’s willingness to provide assistance to the Philippines’ economic recovery, particularly in the fields of food security and tourism,” Andolong noted.

Manila Bulletin,"Malacañang bared that there are “many overlaps” in government policies affecting the movement of agricultural products in the country due to current policies in place which, it said, hinders food security. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and his Cabinet met on Monday, Sept. 12, to discuss the issues concerning food security.   During the meeting, the officials identified factors that hinder the country’s food security and found out that there are indeed overlapping policies that slow down the movement of food supplies. This prompted the President to order a review on the existing policies on the food supply movement. “There are quite many overlaps so all departments will be working together on the policy review, assessment review, and proposals,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a press briefing. According to Angeles, barriers to efficient transportation, red tape, permit systems, and the crossing of boundaries between local government units (LGUs) were among the areas that need to be reviewed.   “We’re also looking at a review of policy and possible legislation to balance importation with local production and to address the issues of over and under production,” Angeles said. The Press Secretary said the Department of Agriculture (DA), which Marcos heads in a concurrent capacity, Department of Transportation (DOTr), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA will participate in the review and assessment of policies. There were also several proposals made during the Cabinet meeting to address the issue. “Many of which we’ll be happy to announce at a later date once we have all the details. But the recognition of the problem is step 1, as well as the proposals by our various Cabinet officials regarding policy review and legislation,” Angeles said.  ",0

Manila Bulletin,"The Senate wants the Philippines represented by the best team it can produce. “Second, we are here to support in whatever capacity we can be it through legislation or funding and; third, that we have programs for the development of our basketball and sports programs.’’   These were stressed by Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva during the organizational meeting of the Senate sports committee chaired by Senator Christopher ‘’Bong’’ Go. ‘’We are here to support our athletes, coaches, our national sports association and the PSC (Philippine Sport Commission) We are not here to meddle with negotiations,’’ Villanueva pointed out. The committee was briefed by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) and the Games Amusement Board (GAB) on the current situation of the amateur and professional sports in the country. Villanueva said he finished his education because of basketball, having played for the National Capital Region in the Palarong Pambansa.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Grace Poe has filed a bill seeking to make further discounts on the water and electric consumption of senior citizens.   Poe’s measure, Senate Bill 12066, seeks to grant senior citizens a minimum five percent discount on the first 150 kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity and on the first 50 cubic meters of water consumption supplied by public utilities and an exemption from value added tax (VAT). The bill seeks to amend Republic Act 9994, known. as the ‘’Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010.’’ To extend more benefits to senior citizens, the bill of Poe seeks to amend Republic Act 9994, known as the ‘’Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010’’ whose five percent discount application to senior citizens is limited to water consumption not exceeding 100 kwh and not exceeding 30 cubic meters of water. The Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010 recognizes the great contributions of Philippine senior citizens in nation building in that they are considered as ‘’integral part of the Philippine society.’’   ‘’Constitutional principles resonate with the right of elderly citizens to ..adequate food, water, shelter, clothing and health care through the provision of income, family and community support and self-help,’’ the bill of Poe stated. The discount is given where the senior citizen resides and the electric or water meter is registered in his or her name.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Imee Marcos has started the revival of the Nutribun Feeding Program of her late father, President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., with a warning that the government’s nutrition programs at present are “undernourished and will not withstand a looming global food crisis.” A press statement of Marcos stated that the popularity of the Nutribun program in the 70s ‘’still inspires the local feeding programs of incumbent and aspiring politicians, but the national scale and continuity that made the Nutribun a success as a USAID-funded project during the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos’s time has hardly been matched by subsequent administrations.’’   The revival of the program was timed with the celebration of her father’s 105th birth anniversary yesterday. “We must restore the Nutribun Feeding Program’s place as a viable solution to undernutrition among children. It can’t remain an intermittent and sporadic advocacy,” Marcos emphasized. To that end, the lady senator joined forces with the National Nutrition Council, which her father established in 1974, and various local government units (LGUs), municipal offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and barangay health workers. Simultaneous pilot-testing of the Nutribun Feeding Program took place Sunday in Rizal, Cebu, and Ilocos Norte, where 1,000 children, three to five years old, in each province received packs of the iconic bread made with squash, malunggay (moringa), and other locally available, high-nutrient crops.   Beyond the mere distribution of the fortified Nutribun, Marcos’s office and all government workers involved will be monitoring the children’s weight and state of health throughout the next 120 days. Marcos’s personal initiative complements the government’s nutrition programs to be bolstered with $178 million in recent funding from the World Bank, so that the high incidence of child stunting in the Philippines can be reversed. The World Bank noted in its 2021 report that there have been “almost no improvements in the prevalence of undernutrition in the Philippines” in the past 30 years and added that “the country is ranked fifth in the East Asia and Pacific Region with the highest prevalence of stunting and is among the 10 countries in the world with the highest number of stunted children.” “There’s no more time to lose, if the next generations of Filipino children are to be healthy in body and mind, and ultimately productive as grown-up citizens,” Marcos said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito has joined other senators in calling for a Senate investigation into the spate of kidnappings, abduction and disappearances in the country. Ejercito made the call even after Sen. Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa vowed to probe the issue as chair of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs. The senator said it is disturbing that among the reported cases of disappearances involve young women, alleged Chinese workers and those who are Filipino-Chinese.   He noted that some of the victims were later on found dead, and showed signs they were tortured. According to Ejercito, the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (PCCCI) claimed that the kidnapping cases in the last 10 days have surged to 56. But the Philippine National Police (PNP) said there were only 27 recorded kidnapping incidents from January of this year.   Though the incidents of alleged abductions and killings involve foreigners, there is no assurance that Filipinos won’t be targeted by these criminals, Ejercito pointed out. “The government should act swiftly to put an end to these spate of kidnappings and killings; take control of the situation; and guarantee our people of their safety and provide an assurance of a peaceful community,” Ejercito said in his Senate Resolution No. 194. “As the Philippine economy continues to recover from the negative effects of the pandemic by opening its doors to tourists and investors, the government should see to it that the country is indeed a safe place to visit and do business,” he further said. The senator also said it is an insult to the Philippine government that the alleged perpetrators, who now appears to be foreigners also, have no respect to “the laws of our land.” “There is a need to establish peace and order in our society and send a message to everyone, Filipinos and foreigners alike, that no one is above the law,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) will hire more lawyers to expedite the resolution of agrarian cases, Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III said. This is in line with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos Jr.’s commitment to provide social justice and free the farmers from the bondage of the soil, Estrella said.   “Currently, the DAR is experiencing a shortage of lawyers to review all agrarian disputes that are pending under the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) and Agrarian Law Implementation (ALI),” the secretary said in a statement. Estrella said that the DARAB received a total of 640,807 cases from 1988 to June 2022. A total of 638,445 of these were adjudicated, leaving a balance of 2,362 ongoing cases.   Meanwhile, from 1993 to June 2022, the DAR received a total of 945,875 ALI caseloads, resolving 943,584 cases and leaving a balance of 2,291 pending cases. Estrella said it is very hard for the DAR to hire competent and top-notch lawyers who can assist the agrarian reform department to resolve its pending cases. “Our game plan is to do a scrap and build scheme. We will abolish vacant positions so that we can create positions to offer bigger salaries to the lawyers,” he said.   According to him, the DAR will implement the “real mandate” of the program, which is to provide social justice and free farmers from the bondage of the land. “The DAR will encourage more lawyers to join the team to help us review pending cases, conduct fast-tracking activities, and enhance its legal case monitoring system,” said Estrella. The DAR may not be able to achieve a zero backlog at this point but it is the DAR’s commitment to provide a higher percentage of solving pending cases, he said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Jinggoy Estrada on Sunday, September 11 urged the government to double the amount of financial subsidy to state workers to help them augment their income amid the continuing rise of oil and basic necessities.   Estrada, who chairs the Senate Committee on Labor, Employment and Human Resources Development said the current relief allowance given by the state to government workers is insufficient to cover the continuing rise in the cost of living aggravated by the spike in oil prices. The senator said it is high-time that the government’s financial assistance to state workers through the Personnel Economic Relief Allowance (PERA) be increased from P2,000 to P4,000 per month.   “Napapanahon na rin na itaas ito sa P4,000 kada buwan para mapunan ang ilang gastusin ng mga manggagawa sa gobyerno na kadalasang tumutugon sa mga pampublikong tungkulin lalo na sa panahon na may krisis at kalamidad (It’s high time we increase it to P4,000 per month so state workers can cope especially in times of crisis and calamity since they are the ones at the frontlines of public service),” Estrada said. For this purpose, Estrada filed Senate Bill No. 1027, proposing the grant of an additional P2,000 in the monthly PERA of government employees and rename it as Augmented Personnel Economic Relief Allowance (APERA). Under the bill, the beneficiaries include military and uniformed personnel as well as civilian government employees occupying regular, contractual, or casual positions, whether appointive or elective positions.   But those stationed abroad who are already receiving overseas allowances shall not be entitled to APERA, the senator said. The PERA was first granted in 1990 to all government employees to cushion the impact of price increases brought about by the Gulf War. The monthly P500 PERA was increased to P2,000 in 2009 to supplement government workers’ salaries due to the rising cost of living. But with the continued rise of prices of commodities and gasoline, Estrada said the P2,000 allowance “is definitely not enough to help them tide over the financial difficulties.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Former Senator Leila de Lima recalled that the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor already mentioned the names of former President Rodrigo Duterte and former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief and now Senator Ronald dela Rosa as two of the personalities possibly responsible for the state-sponsored killings under the previous administration’s war on illegal drugs.   `’’So long as the government is not going after the top leadership of the PNP death squads who committed the killings, the ICC will not be dissuaded from ordering the Prosecutor to resume his investigation on Duterte’s crimes against humanity,’’ she said in a Viber message to Senate reporters. In her statement, De Lima claimed that the current Marcos administration, through the office of the Solicitor General, seeks to stop the investigation of the widespread extra-judicial killings (EJKs) committed during Duterte’s drug war, “which, I firmly contend, amount to crimes against humanity”. ‘’They want the International Criminal Court’s Pre-Trial Chamber to tell the ICC Prosecutor not to resume its investigation. This government says that the ICC has no jurisdiction because the killings were not a systematic attack on the Filipino civilian population and that the Philippine state is investigating and prosecuting whatever crimes were committed. Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra also claims that the killings were not the result of a state policy or program to kill drug suspects in police operations,’’ she stressed. ‘’These porous claims cannot persuade the ICC. The ICC is the least of all to believe these claims considering the amount of evidence already gathered by the ICC Prosecutor showing that the killings were indeed state-sponsored. No less than the public statements of Duterte himself calling on the PNP to eliminate drug suspects are on record in the ICC Prosecutor’s investigation. Guevarra cannot go on denying that Duterte publicly ordered the killings with his arrogant and reckless statements,’’ the ex-senator added.   De Lima maintained that it is “callous and narrow-minded, if not dishonest, for the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to deny the existence of a state-sponsored systematic attack when we all witnessed the prevalent, almost daily occurrence, especially at the height of Duterte’s drug war mid-2016 up to 2017, of summary executions of suspected drug offenders by PNP and vigilante death squads”. She said that the ICC would also just brush aside Guevarra’s claim that the Philippine state is able and willing to investigate and prosecute the drug war killings. ‘’Then and now, the government is unable to show the ICC any convincing proof of the existence of a genuine domestic investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the drug war carnage, particularly those with the highest responsibility therefor. Up to the present, neither the DOJ nor the Ombudsman is in the process of filing any criminal action against Duterte despite his loss of immunity,’’ she emphasized. ‘’The Marcos Jr. government is also not investigating or prosecuting Duterte’s top PNP generals and officers who carried out his unlawful orders during the drug war,’’ she said. De Lima said that ‘’the Rome Statute is a robust international institution that will not be defeated or dissuaded by the propaganda and rhetorics of Duterte’s defenders and enablers who, sadly, still bear much clout under the present dispensation”. ‘’Resisting an intervention by ICC, an international body equipped with the competence and singular determination to inquire into crimes of such scale as crimes against humanity, and beyond the reach of the influence of the strongman former President, connotes a misplaced sense of national self-worth. True justice for thousands of victims of the drug war killings cannot be denied on account of a false notion of sovereignty,’’ she added.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. will study the recommendation of the government’s Covid-19 pandemic task force to make wearing face masks outdoors optional. Marcos said this after the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) for the management of Emerging Infectious Diseases recommended allowing the optional wearing of face masks outdoors.   In a Facebook post, the President said he had met with officials from the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to discuss the coronavirus situation in the country. “Nagagalak tayong malaman na dahil sa ating pinaigting na pagbabakuna ay patuloy ang pagbaba ng bilang ng mga nagpopositibo (We’re happy to find out that there is a decreasing number of people catching the disease as we intensify our vaccination),” he wrote. “Kaugnay nito, atin ngayong pinag-aaralan ang rekomendasyon ng IATF ukol sa opsyonal na pagsusuot ng face mask (With this, we’re studying the recommendation of the IATF about the optional wearing of face masks),” he added. The President’s meeting came after he completed his State Visit to Singapore, a country that allows the voluntary wearing of face masks in public places aside from public transport and health facilities.   In proposing the mask-off policy, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos, citing data from Southeast Asian nations, said there was no significant difference between the number of Covid-19 cases in areas where the wearing of face masks was mandatory and where they were partially or wholly lifted as long as minimum public health standards are strictly observed. DOH officer-in-charge Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire backed the proposal but urged the public to continue wearing one. To date, the country has recorded 3,901,033 Covid-19 cases. As of September 9, a total of 161,497,618 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered in the country.  ",0

The DSWD admitted the agency can no longer handle the huge volume of applicants. “Inamin naman po ni Secretary [Erwin Tulfo] medyo luma na po yung ginagamit naming sistema. And then ngayon lang po ito nakaranas ng ganitong volume po ng mga aplikante (Secretary Erwin Tulfo has already admitted that the system we are using is quite old. And then only now has the agency experienced this volume of applicants),” Lopez said. “Pero huwag sila mag-alala dahil yun pong mga nakapag-register na ay patuloy po naming ipo-proseso (But don’t worry because we will continue to process those who have already registered),” he added.   DSWD’s consolidated report showed that P735 million in educational aid has been distributed to 293,205 student-beneficiaries in the past four Saturdays. Of the total student-beneficiaries, 88,084 are in elementary (P88.71 million); 65,896 are in junior high school (P131.71 million); 41,766 in senior high school (P125.96 million); and 97,408 in college/vocational school (P388.75 million). Lopez said that the DSWD may provide assistance to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 students-in-crisis with the remaining funds. “Down to last two Saturdays na lang tayo, hanggang Sept. 24, and then wala na tayong magiging extension (We’re down to the last two Saturdays, until Sept. 24, and we will not have an extension),” Lopez said. He said that Tulfo had a meeting with House Speaker Martin Romualdez where they discussed the possible continuation of the educational payout through the help of the district representatives. “Yun pong hindi mako-cover ng DSWD sa amin pong pondo na P1.5 billion [dahil] medyo paubos na po ito, more than half na ang nagagamit natin, so ito po’y iko-cover na ng ating mga district representatives. Sila na po ang magdidisburse ng kanilang pondo (The DSWD cannot cover all beneficiaries with our P1.5 billion fund because our fund is about to be depleted. We have already released more than half of it. So our district representatives may cover it as they will disburse their own funds),” Lopez said.   He added the DSWD will probably complete the guidelines by next week after another meeting between Tulfo and Romualdez. “With this, umaasa po tayo na sa pagpasok naman po ng ating mga mambabatas ay yung ating mga maiiwanan, hindi masasakop nitong ating mga 2 million na aplikante ay maaaring sila naman po ang maabot ng ating mga mambabatas sa pagtulong nila sa atin sa ating pamamahagi ng educational payout (With this, let’s hope that when our legislators help us, those who may have been left behind, who were not included in the two million applicants, our legislators may reach them by helping us in our distribution of educational payout),” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros commended on Saturday, Sept. 10 the decision of the Sandiganbayan to drop criminal charges against “pastillas” scam whistleblower Jeffrey Dale Ignacio, and to instead admit him as state witness against high-ranking Bureau of Immigration (BI) officials involved in criminal activity.   ‘’I thank the anti-graft court for heeding our previous calls to consider Jeffrey’s cooperation with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality – which I lead as chairperson – during our probe on the “pastillas” scam in the Bureau of Immigration (BI),’’ Hontiveros said. ‘’Jeffrey’s detailed and valuable testimony has helped shine a light on the almost-institutionalized corruption in the BI, and helped identify some of the ‘big cats’ involved in this multi-billion peso racket,’’ she pointed out. ‘’As a state witness, I hope his testimony will provide a big boost to the prosecution of these erring officials and employees,’’ she added. Hontiveros said that ‘’These officials involved in the ‘pastillas’ scam enabled not only the illegal entry of countless Chinese nationals, but also the trafficking of Filipino women and children.’’   ‘’Malaki ang kasalanan ng mga sangkot sa scam na ito sa ating bayan (These officials committed a very serious offense against the State),” she added. “Whistleblowers like Jeffrey Dale Ignacio, Allison Chiong, and others should receive ample protection and assistance from the government, so that justice may be fully served and all those accountable for this scam put behind bars,’’ she added.

Manila Bulletin,"Philippine National Police (PNP) Deputy Chief for Administration Jose Chiquito Malayo has disputed the figures, saying only four abduction incidents have been recorded this year. One of them is related to Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs), with kidnappers being foreign nationals. The figure cited by Malayo was belied just a few days later when a PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) report said that cases of kidnapping targeting workers of POGO firms have increased by 25 percent. The report from AKG showed that there were 27 kidnapping cases from January to September, with 15 POGO-related, 11 kidnap-for-ransom (KFR) cases and one casino-related case.   PNP Spokesperson Colonel Jean Fajardo said that they are not discounting the possibility that some cases of kidnapping of POGO workers were not being reported to authorities. “There is an urgent need to determine the status of these cases, possible motives, agency efforts to identify the perpetrators, and the measures instituted by relevant authorities to prevent the continuous rise of abduction cases in the country,’’ Poe’s resolution said. “There is also a need to ascertain claims that foreign nationals are conducting these criminal activities,” the resolution added.

Manila Bulletin,"As the country celebrates National Teachers’ Month from September 5 to October 5, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian vowed to pursue measures that would uphold the welfare of teachers, aside from giving them larger salaries.   The chairman of the Senate Committee on Basic Education thanked teachers for their hard work and sacrifice to ensure learning continuity despite the threat of Covid-19. Since teachers are among the most important factors in children’s learning, Gatchalian emphasized the need to raise teachers’ morale and to keep them motivated. Gatchalian ’s topmost priority measure in the current 19th Congress is the Teacher Salary Increase Act (Senate Bill [SB] No. 149), which seeks to increase the salary grades (SG) of Teacher I from SG 11 with a salary of P25,439, to SG 13 with a salary of P29,798; Teacher II from SG 12 (P27,608) to SG 14 (P32,321); and Teacher III from SG 13 (P29,798) to SG 15 (P35,097). The lawmaker has been pointing out that when it comes to salaries, Filipino teachers have been left behind by their peers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.   In Singapore, for example, the average monthly entry-level salary of teachers is P51,820, the highest in ASEAN. In Malaysia, the average monthly entry-level teacher salary is P44,607. Aside from raising teacher salaries, Gatchalian also reiterated his call for the full implementation of the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers (Republic Act [RA] No. 4670). Before the close of the 18th Congress, Gatchalian reported the basic education panel’s findings on the implementation of the 56-year-old law. Among Gatchalian’s recommendations was to decongest teachers’ workload so they could allocate more time for actual teaching. In the long run, Gatchalian eyes having enough non-teaching personnel in all schools. Gatchalian also highlighted the need to ensure adequate health insurance for teachers.   He cited a proposal from the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS), which showed that for a premium of P400 per teacher, DepEd personnel would each enjoy coverage of up to P120,000. Subsidizing these premiums would cost P369.8 million, a reasonable amount according to Gatchalian. Gatchalian said he also plans to file a bill that would amend the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers and make it more responsive to present-day challenges.   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Sandiganbayan has denied the motions of businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles and former Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Finance Director Teresita L. Panlilio to dismiss the criminal charges against them involving the alleged irregular use of P50 million in public funds. Napoles and Panlilio have been charged with 10 counts each of violations of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and another 10 counts each of violations of Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) on malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents. The prosecution alleged that they acted in conspiracy with former DAR Undersecretary for Support Services Jerry E. Pacturan, Chief Accountant Rowena U. Agbayani, and private individuals Evelyn de Leon and Ronald John Lim Jr. when they reportedly diverted P50 million to the fake non-government organizations owned by Napoles — the Ginintuang Alay sa Magsasaka Foundation Inc. (GAMFI) and Philippine Social Development Foundation Inc. (PSDFI). In her motion, Napoles said that the prosecution’s pieces of evidence do not support the allegation that she actually owned the named NGOs to which public funds were diverted.   Panlilio, on the other hand, argued that her rights to due process and to speedy disposition of cases were violated. The Sandiganbayan denied their motions. “Accused Napoles’ contention is untenable,” the court said as it pointed out that “indeed, the Amended Informations (criminal charge sheets) allege that accused Napoles controlled the named NGOs.” “The charges against her are not based solely on her alleged control of the said NGOs, but also on her alleged specific acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit the crimes charged,” the anti-graft court said. On Panlilio’s motion, the court ruled that there was no “complete disregard” of the established procedure on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman, or that the investigation was motivated by malice or merely to harass the respondents. “It also appears that the Office of the Ombudsman gave the respondents ample opportunity to explain their side by filing their respective counter-affidavits,” the resolution stated. Sandiganbayan’s Sixth Division Chairperson Sarah Jane T. Fernandez wrote the resolution with the concurrence of Associate Justices Kevin Narce B. Vivero and Georgina D. Hidalgo.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Northern Samar 1st district Rep. Paul Daza told the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Thursday, Sept. 8 to be honest with the results of its free public Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) program. This, after the DICT painted a rather rosy picture of the program during its presentation in their budget hearing before members of the House Committee on Appropriations. Daza, in his subsequent interpellation of the DICT contingent headed by its Secretary Ivan John Uy, demanded to know the person who prepared the slides on the free public Internet program. “This is not representative of the actual state of the free public Wi-Fi. To be polite, it’s intellectual dishonesty,” a miffed Daza said. The senior deputy minority leader pointed out that “There were many interpellations regarding the frustration with the free public Wi-Fi.” But Daza acknowledged that Uy was yet to warm his seat as DICT head honcho. “If we can request the new secretary to do a comprehensive, honest-to-goodness, objective report on the appropriations for the free public Wi-Fi, utilization, operational accomplishment report–the details. And with his recommendation and action plan moving forward. Can we request that from the good secretary?” he said. Uy replied, “We’d be more than happy to comply.” Next, Daza asked Uy if the status of the program had been relayed to President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The Cabinet official answered in the negative and said, “Most of our meetings have been forward-looking; we have not done any audit or assessment of our predecessors.” Daza requested Uy to furnish Malacañang a copy of the report that he asked them to dp. In a subsequent statement, Daza noted that the free public Wi-Fi program’s target since 2016 was to provide 105,000 free public Wi-Fi spots, and that Congress had allocated approximately P12 billion to the project since that time. However, according to the statistics Daza presented, only 10 percent of these sites have been established and only 4 percent are operational to date. “We’re hoping that [the free public Wi-Fi] will be a priority for the new secretary and the new officials,” he said.",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Philippines must not be left behind in technological innovations, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said as he reaffirmed his administration’s commitment in advancing the country’s digitalization. Speaking during the inauguration of the Union Bank Innovation Campus in San Pedro City, Laguna, Marcos noted that the pandemic accelerated the use of technology and digitalization, which became a “viable way of doing business.”   “We in government have gone a step further than that, not only is it (a) viable way of doing business, it is the only way that we will be doing business in the years to come, and therefore, we cannot allow the Philippines to get left behind,” Marcos said. The President stressed that it is necessary to not only adjust to the digital age, “but position ourselves to take full advantage of it.” He said that the inauguration of the UnionBank campus is “precisely the kind of innovations, forward-thinking, operations, and actions that the country needs” both in the private and public sector. The Chief Executive also expressed confidence that the vision of becoming a world-class and tech-savvy country will come to fruition, “if we continue to be aware of all the fast-moving developments in technology out there.”   “As tomorrow dawns and leads to brighter days ahead, let us renew our commitment to improve our present state and make lives better and more comfortable for everyone with the help of the technology that we know is now available to us,” Marcos said. “Together, let us combine our abilities towards this resurgence of all our industries that were deeply affected by the current pandemic and other global challenges,” he added. Digitalization of payments The President, in his speech, also said that UnionBank’s initiative “perfectly fits” into the three-year Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which promotes the digitalization of payments toward furthering financial inclusion. The roadmap aims to convert at least 50 percent of the total retail transaction volume into digital form and the onboarding of 70 percent of Filipino adults to the formal financial system next year. “To achieve these targets, we need to hone our competencies in areas such as software development, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, amongst others. This is in line with our goals under the Philippine Skills Framework,” he stressed.   One of the UBIC’s objectives is fostering a greater partnership between the public and private sectors under the Advancing Government ICT Innovation, Leadership, and Excellence or AGILE Program. Aside from bringing digital banking services to the local government units (LGUs), the program will also enhance other digitalization initiatives in the government.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. hailed the 10 outstanding Filipino teachers, soldiers, and policemen recognized by Metrobank Foundation, saying they are the living embodiment of the phrase “beyond excellence.” The 10 Filipino public servants were the recipients of the 2022 Metrobank Foundation Outstanding Filipinos.   Marcos led their awarding ceremony in Malacañang on Friday afternoon, Sept. 9. During his speech, Marcos honored the awardees for their service to the nation, which he described as one of the “most difficult and often thankless jobs that we ask our citizens to do.” “Your constant resolve to fulfill and transcend your duties to the best of your ability will exemplify what it means to be true public servants. You are the living embodiment of the phrase ‘beyond excellence’,” he said. “I know as you know that you need no award for the things you do and it is not the reason why you do that. Not for thanks, not for praise, not for honors. You do what you do because you feel the need to continue with your service and you find fulfillment in that,” he added.   The awardees were: Mr. Junmerth C. Jorta, Teacher I and Officer-in-Charge of Keupiyanan Te Balugo (San Fernando, Bukidnon) Christine Joy DR.

He also thanked the Metrobank Foundation and its partners for recognizing outstanding Filipinos around the country for 30 years now. “This is corporate social responsibility at its best.

Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives and the Senate are looking to expedite the passage of the proposed postponement of the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE) and the SIM Card Registration Bill before Congress goes on recess on Oct. 1. House Majority Leader Rep. Mannix Dalipe joined a meeting with Speaker of the House Rep. Martin Romualdez, Senate President Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, and Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva to help coordinate the direction of the two measures.   “We initially met last night [Thursday, Sept. 8] to discuss our common legislative agenda. The House and Senate leaderships are eyeing the postponement of barangay and SK elections and passage of SIM card registration bill before our adjournment this September. This is to ensure that the entire Congress is moving forward in the same direction,” said Dalipe on Friday, Sept. 9. As per the calendar of session of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber will temporarily adjourn from Oct. 1, 2022 until Nov. 6, 2022. The other legislative chamber, the Senate, will follow the same schedule. Dalipe also promised the passage of the 2023 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) in time for the adjournment. “The House will also pass by Oct. 1 the national budget for next year.” The two measures, the BSKE postponement and the SIM Card Registration Bill, have been approved by the House Committee on Appropriations and the House Committee on Information and Communications Technology, respectively.  Dalipe further vowed improved coordination between the leaderships of the House and the Senate in passing some of the priority measures of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., namely: the Mandatory Reserve Officers’ Training Corps for students, the creation of a Philippine Virology Institute, the creation of a Center for Disease Control, Magna Cartas for seafarers and barangay health workers, and amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer law.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Grace Poe on Friday, Sept. 9 said Filipinos’ quest for a law that would accord foundlings with rights and protection has reached a milestone with the signing of its implementing rules and regulations (IRR). “I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of this landmark legislation. No sweeter words could ever be written. Today, we, foundlings, are no longer invisible,” Poe said during the ceremonial signing of the IRR of Republic Act (RA) 11767, or the Foundling Recognition and Protection Act. “We achieved victory with the enactment of the law. With the IRR, we hope to see all abandoned children enjoying equal treatment and every available service due them,” Poe added.   A foundling herself who was found in an Iloilo church and adopted by movie icons Fernando Poe Jr. and Susan Roces, Poe first filed the bill in 2015 to strengthen the system for registering the birth of children in need of special protection, including foundlings like her. In the same year, she battled questions to her citizenship as she faced a disqualification case on her presidential run. She elevated the case to the Supreme Court (SC), which ruled in her favor. The SC said that the 1987 Constitution guarantees the basic right to equal protection of the laws. The High Tribunal also pointed out that the Philippines is a signatory to several treaties that generally accepted principles of international law and presume foundlings as having been born of nationals of the country in which the foundling is found.   “For decades, just as I had been left alone and defenseless in that church, no laws took the cudgels on our behalf. Our legislations were silent on foundlings and they were not specifically mentioned as being natural-born Filipino citizens,” Poe said. “The implications of this was that foundlings were stateless and could be technically deprived of protection from the State,” she added. Poe said the momentous court decision on her disqualification case was a victory for all foundlings in this country. “With the passage of RA 11767 and its IRR, my heart is full,” Poe said. The senator highlighted Section 5 of the law, which states, “A foundling found in the Philippines and/or in Philippine embassies, consulates and territories abroad is presumed a natural-born Filipino citizen regardless of the status or circumstances of birth.’’ “As a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a foundling is accorded with rights and protection at the moment of birth equivalent to those belonging to such class of citizens whose citizenship does not need perfection or any further act,” the law added.   The natural-born status of a foundling shall not also be affected by the fact that the birth certificate was simulated or that there was absence of a legal adoption process or that there was inaction or delay in reporting, documenting or registering a foundling,” the law further said. Poe called on concerned agencies to implement the law fully and effectively. “We must work together to make the country a shining example of humanitarianism by being a safe haven for foundlings,” she said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva on Friday, September 9 said the drop in the unemployment from 5.2 percent to six percent in July is a “positive sign” but the rise in the actual number of underemployed Filipinos “remains concerning.” The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) stated that underemployed Filipinos were estimated at 6.54 million in July 2022, higher than the 5.89 million estimate in June 2022.   “We still face a precarious jobs situation which requires aggressive intervention,” Villanueva, former chairman of the Senate labor committee, said. “We need jobs that are secure and pay decently, not temporary, informal and insecure, especially amid rising prices due to inflation which clocked in at 6.3 percent last August,” he added. Villanueva assured that the Senate would continue to pursue the passage of Senate Bill 129, or the “Trabaho Para sa Lahat ng Pilipino Act.” The measure calls for the institutionalization of a National Employment Recovery Strategy to strengthen jobs generation programs through linkages with local government units (LGUs).   He said the Senate would thoroughly scrutinize the 2023 national budget to ensure it would fuel economic activities to create jobs and services. “We will see to it that relevant education and trainings are funded to arm future workers in landing in sustainable employment or livelihood,” Villanueva said. “The budget coupled with correct policies should lead the path to jobs recovery that will help fix the pandemic-scarred economy and lift the lives of our people,” he pointed out.

During the ceremonial signing of the IRR, Hontiveros also honored her colleagues in Congress for working together to quickly pass the measure despite the challenges brought by the pandemic. Hontiveros cited in particular Sen. Grace Poe whose personal story and struggles of being a foundling “gave more meaning to the crafting of the measure.”   She also thanked Senators Manuel “Lito” Lapid, Pia Cayetano, Rep. Yedda Romualdez who also support and worked hard for the passage into law of the measure. “The swiftness with which we were able to push for this measure only shows our collective willingness, our urgency, our hope to do right by our children,” she added. The law, which was signed last May 2022, seeks to promote the rights of and to provide greater protection to deserted or abandoned children.   Hontiveros said that under the new law, foundlings are now given the right to access government programs and services, such as registration, facilitation of documents for adoption, education, protection, nourishment, and care, among others. Also under the law, a foundling shall be presumed a natural-born Filipino citizen if found in the Philippines or in the country’s embassies, consulates, and territories. “May we never forget that the foundlings, our children, are the beating heart and very soul of this law,” Hontiveros stressed.

Manila Bulletin,"Deputy Majority Leader Senator Mark A. Villar has filed a resolution seeking a probe on the alleged price increase and supply shortage of various manufactured goods. Villar’s Senate Resolution No. 193 explained that the continuous increase in prices erode the purchasing power of the poor and marginalized sectors in the country. He said this has a significant impact on poverty as the upswing in prices would directly hit the pockets of the consumers already tightening their belts because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and might result to hunger.   The bill also stated that negative impact of price hikes are apparent as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) already suggested to the consumers to purchase their Noche Buena needs earlier to avoid a surge in market prices during the Christmas season. “The DTI already suggested to buy Noche Buena needs this early. If that’s the case, gaano nalang kataas ang mga bilihin come December (how much more would the increase of Christmas goods be) ? We really need to look into this,” Villar pointed out. Villar, chairman of the Senate trade committee, also mentioned that the price stability of manufactured goods is a significant factor for food security to ensure that these products are not only available to consumers but also to ascertain that every Filipino could afford them. “It is vital that as legislators, we promote the improvement of local industries, enhance market competitiveness and balance the welfare of both the producers and the consumers,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robinhood “Robin” C. Padilla has sought an investigation into the row that has prevented Aetas in the Clark Sub-Zone in Central Luzon from getting some P19-million in funds stemming from an agreement signed in 2007. Padilla filed Senate Resolution 149 to investigate the Joint Management Agreement (JMA) of the Clark Development Corp. (CDC), National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and Tribong Ayta on Dec. 6, 2007. “Fourteen (14) years since the signing of the JMA, the Tribong Ayta are yet to receive their full share of the 20 percent of the net income arising from rentals and use of the ancestral domain as reported by the Aytas of Sitio Haduan, Mabalacat, Pampanga, during an audience on August 2, 2022 with the Office of Senator Robinhood Padilla in Pasay City,” Padilla said in his resolution.   The resolution mandates the Senate Committee on Cultural Communities and Muslim Affairs, which Padilla chairs, to conduct the probe. According to Padilla, the issue prompted him to go to Pampanga to meet anew with the Aetas and the CDC on August 4. CDC President Manuel Gaerlan said they could not give the Aetas the 20 percent share as there are three groups claiming to represent them – the BATA, MATA, and STA. Pending the resolution of the issue, the CDC placed the funds – amounting to P19.203 milyon as of Oct. 31, 2019 – in a trust fund with the Land Bank of the Philippines. In his resolution, Padilla wants the investigation to ensure the rights of the Aetas and to look into the implementation of the JMA, as well as the role of the NCIP.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said there is an urgent need for the government to implement a nationwide academic recovery program in order to avert school closures as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The senator said the lack of face-to-face classes has resulted to trillions of pesos in productivity losses due to the economic consequences of schools shutting down.   In a Senate panel hearing on Senate Bill No. 150 or the proposed Academic Recovery and Accessible Learning (ARAL) Program Act, Gatchalian said there is a need to implement a national core strategy to allow learners to catch up with the rest of the world despite their learning loss. The Senate Committee on Basic Education chair said the proposed program will include well-systematized tutorial sessions and well-designed remediation plans. Citing estimates by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the lawmaker said the lack of face-to-face classes for a year will result in P10.8-trillion in productivity losses over the next 40 years. Gatchalian said that while his initial proposal of a P20-billion allocation for the implementation of the ARAL program, the amount is small compared to the projected productivity losses.   “Twenty billion pesos (P20-billion) is only 0.18% of the potential productivity losses for the next 40 years. So to avert that, P20 billion is actually quite cheap to spend on an academic recovery program. On the other side, if you don’t do anything, we lose P10-trillion right away,” said Gatchalian. “If we don’t do a massive academic recovery program, we will see a much worse number for our assessments because during pre-pandemic it was already dismal,” he added. The measure, he said, will target learners who did not enroll for School Year 2020-2021, those who are lagging academically, and those who are at and marginally above the minimum level of mastery required in Language, Mathematics, and Science. The bill will also cover the most essential learning competencies under Language and Mathematics for Grades 1 to 10, and Science for Grades 3 to 10. For Kindergarten learners, literacy and numeracy competencies will be given focus to build on their foundational competencies.",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has told the private sector to take advantage of the innovations developed by experts to produce more jobs for Filipinos as he urged them to continue exploring limitless possibilities in the digital age. Speaking at the inauguration of the UnionBank Innovation Campus in San Pedro, Laguna on Friday, Sept. 9, Marcos said the country could bank on the “silver lining” brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is the hastening of the adoption of technological innovations, to improve the digital way of doing business.   “We found avenues that brought us closer together, and despite the lockdown and the distance between us. We learned to hold meetings, even court trials, online,” the President said. “To sustain growth and promote new advances in this sector, it is my hope that you will explore the limitless possibilities, and take advantage of the many bright ideas that our experts have, so that we can generate more jobs and secure our nation’s economic revitalization,” he added. The Chief Executive said that his administration is keen on applying the “uncontested” innovation and digital solutions in the banking sector to the public sector in terms of digitalizing the government at the local and national level. He stressed that it is necessary to be able to take advantage of the efficiencies of digital transactions and not be “neglectful” about this trend.   “We would be bereft, we would be neglectful of our duties if we do not recognize the trend that is happening around the world. And not only adjust to it, but position ourselves to take full advantage of it,” he said. Marcos has also committed to the banking and information technology industries that his administration will work closely with them in making use of their innovations even in the public sector for the benefit of ordinary citizens. “With you as our partner in this endeavor, I am very confident that our vision of becoming a world-class and tech-savvy country will come to fruition, especially if we focus on the tasks at hand, we have aligned our goals, and we continue to be aware of all the fast-moving developments in technology out there, so we as a people, we as an economy, can take full advantage of those new technologies,” he said. “Rest assured this administration is committed to working closely with you, with other stakeholders in the banking and ICT (information and communications technology) industry, especially as it redounds to the benefit of our people,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman George Garcia thinks that the Omnibus Election Code should be amended to modernize the definition of “vote-buying”. During the House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing with the Comelec, Batangas 2nd district Rep. Gerville Luistro asked this question: “May we know the thoughts of the Comelec with respect to vote-buying or no vote-buying as this likewise disenfranchised our voters?”   Garcia commented that the current definition of the act is outdated and is thus abuse by “unscrupulous” individuals who are up to no good. “Section 261 A of the Omnibus Election Code defined what is vote-buying. Unfortunately, our Omnibus code was circa 1985,” Garcia began during the budget hearing Friday, Sept. 9. “There is a pending bill here in our Congress that imposes an increased penalty for those who are engaged in vote-buying. We actually support this initiative but we are of the belief that aside from increasing the penalty…it is high-time that we redefine what is the meaning of vote-buying,” he explained. One of those bills is House Bill (HB) 1709 by Malasakit@Bayanihan Party-list Rep. Anthony Golez. The measure wants 20 to 40 years of imprisonment, a fine of not less than P5 million, and perpetual disqualification from public office for politicians found guilty of vote-buying.   It is pending with the House Committee on Justice. “Yung vote buying sa kasalukuyang panahon ay maaaring hindi na macocover ng definition ng (Vote-buying in the modern day may not be covered by the definition listed in) 261 A of the Omnibus Election Code…It may be used by certain candidates or unscrupulous individuals,” the Comelec chairman said. “Kasi nga po may loophole ang batas (It’s because there’s a loophole in the law). For example, vote-buying using your cellphone, or such as using GCash or PayMaya or other modes of transferring fund,” Garcia noted. “Next ang pag gastos ng ilan nating mga (is the spending of) local officials. Wala pong exceptions sa (There are no exceptions for) social services. Dun pa lang din po may (That alone has a) loophole. How do you distinguish social services and vote buying? Namimigay po ng mga tulong lalo na (They distribute aid) as pandemic response and that is still a function of the local government,” he continued. He mentioned the distribution of election merchandise including wrist ballers, t-shirts, and caps, and even food items as an act that could be considered an election offense.   Garcia admitted to some “fault” as to why there are so few cases of prosecution against vote-buyers: “To a certain extent, may fault din ng konti ang Comelec (there is some fault in the Comelec). To a certain extent, because of the lack of evidence. Nobody would like to pursue vote-buying as an election offense.” Section 261 A of the Omnibus Election Code defines vote-buying and vote-selling as follows: “Any person who gives, offers or promises money or anything of value, gives or promises any office or employment, franchise or grant, public or private, or makes or offers to make an expenditure, directly or indirectly, or cause an expenditure to be made to any person, association, corporation, entity, or community in order to induce anyone or the public in general to vote for or against any candidate or withhold his vote in the election, or to vote for or against any aspirant for the nomination or choice of a candidate in a convention or similar selection process of a political party. “Any person, association, corporation, group or community who solicits or receives, directly or indirectly, any expenditure or promise of any office or employment, public or private, for any of the foregoing considerations.”  ",0

P7.5 billion that we have right now so we have still a deficiency of P9.5 billion,” Garcia said on Sept. 9. “[For December 2023], P18,441,376,000, less P7.5 billion that we have right now, then we still have a deficiency of P10,858,030,000,” added the Comelec chairman. The Comelec has about P7.5 billion in reserve funds, plus the P1.05 billion left over from the 2022 national and local elections. Garcia also said that they have P421 million in savings. He was then asked how the Comelec came up with the proposed values.   “When we submitted to the Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms our computation, in summary, kapag po tayo ay nag reset ng (if we reset the) election on Dec. 5, 2022, magsisimula po kami ng aming (we will start) continuing registration by October of this year. Kung May of 2023, we will be conducting registration from October to December. Ang projection ng Philippine Statistics Authority that we agree with based on our projection na hindi po nagparehistro ay (that have not registered yet are) three million voters,” he began. “If we are going to reset the election by December 2023, we will have to have our continuing registration from October of this year to June of next year…Therefore, our projection namin yung mga 14-years-old na mag 15 na at ang mga hindi pa nakapag rehistro na kababayan natin, ay mahigit po limang million po (of 14-year-olds who will turn 15 and those have not yet registered, it should be almost five million),” Garcia said. “Kung magkakaganun po na December 2023, tataas po ang bilang na presinto. Sa kasalukuyan po ay meron tayong 207,000 precincts. Kung tayo po ay magrereset ng December, from 207,000 magiging 239,000 precincts po (If we move the elections to December 2023, we will need more precincts. We now have 207,000. This would go from 207,000 to 239,000),” Garcia explained. On top of the increase in polling precincts, Garcia added that the Comelec would need to hire an extra 333,212 poll workers to operate these facilities, all of whom are entitled to honoraria worth P10,000, P9,000, or P6,000 depending on their duty classification. Isabela 1st district Rep. Tonypet Albano then asked if Garcia himself was in favor of deferred the BSKE. “We should postpone to allow more voters to vote and more voters to choose their leaders for the SK and Barangay Elections,” he told the House panel   Meanwhile, it was also during this hearing that the House panel approved a consolidated measure that seeks the postponement of the December 2022 BSKEs, although the measure does not specify a new date.

Manila Bulletin,"Twenty-one out of the 34 individual departments are already done with their budget deliberations before the House Committee on Appropriations in connection with the proposed P5.268-trillion national budget for 2023. This, after the appropriations panel chaired by Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co terminated on Thursday, Sept. 8 the budget briefings of the Department of Housing, Settlement, and Urban Development (DHSUD), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Departments of Migrant Workers (DMW), and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The last briefing to be terminated was that of the DTI’s, which ended at 7:15 p.m. Thursday. “Termination” in this context means that the top officials of the concerned departments no longer need to discuss their proposed budget before the appropriations panel. They will, however, need to come back during the plenary debates phase of the budget process in order to help their solon-sponsors defend their respective spending plans before the entire 300-strong chamber. The per agency budget briefings of the appropriations panel are expected to wrap up on Sept. 16. On Thursday morning, Co set the tone for the hearings by underscoring the importance of the mandates of the four departments. “The budgets of the Departments of Migrant Workers; Housing, Settlement, and Urban Development; Labor and Employment; and Trade and Industry impact the most vulnerable members of Philippine society,” he said. “OFWs (Overseas Filipino workers), homeless Filipinos, workers, and MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises) have been among the most affected by the pandemic. Their recovery will spell the recovery of the entire country,” added the ranking congressman. He said the P14.970-billion budget for 2023 of the newly-created DMW will address all aspects of migrant labor, from deployment, to compensation and working conditions; to remittance, to reintegration. Co said the DHSUD’s P3.951-billion outlay for next year seeks to address the homelessness of Filipinos. It is broken down as follows: Office of the Secretary, P1.042 billion; Human Settlements Adjudication Commission, P408.9 million; National Housing Authority, P2 billion; and P500 million subsidy to Social Housing Finance. “The vital role of the government is to ensure that its housing regulations, programs, and projects–especially for the underprivileged and homeless citizens–are not only affordable but also have access to basic services, employment opportunities or livelihood,” he said. “On-site development in creating new settlements must always be pursued, Currently, there are 4.5 million Filipinos who are considered homeless, many of them remain living in dangerous areas, confronted by subhuman conditions like poor sanitation and unclean water,” stressed the Bicolano. He said DOLE’s P25.899-billion budget for 2023 should develop and harness the country’s human resources, as an integral part of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s socio-economic “Agenda for Prosperity” and economic transformation he presented in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA). As for the DTI, their budget of P19.998 billion for next year will focus on the “backbone of the Philippine economy, the MSMSEs”. “That the DTI prioritizes MSMEs is laudable considering that almost all enterprises fall under the category and only a handful are large corporations. We also laud the DTI for focusing on digitalizing commercial processes, including MSMEs, as a strategy to grow the Philippine economy,” Co said.   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Imee Marcos today (Sept. 8) said she would ‘’push the right button’’ on some issues surrounding Philippine-US military agreements when she goes to Washington D.C. this month. This after Marcos asked the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the defuse establishment for ‘’briefers’’’ (briefing materials) on the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defence Treaty (MDT), the 2016 PH-US Enhanched Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) and the 1998 PH-US Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). During the organisational meeting of her Senate foreign relations committee today, Marcos told the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) that the MDT is not clear. She said pronouncements by US officials on how they would help the Philippines in case of attacks on ‘’public vessels’’ have been made ‘’but these are statements.’’ ‘’What does the Philippines expect from the US?,’’ she asked. Assurances had been made by US State Department Secretary Michael Pompeyo to then DFA Secretary Teodoro Tocsin Jr. that the MDT would be adhered to adhered to if its ally was a victim of aggression, and singled out China as a threat to stability. “China’s island-building and military activities in the South China Sea threaten your sovereignty, security and therefore economic livelihood as well as that of the United States,” Pompeyo told a news conference in Manila in 2019. Recently, State Department Secretary Antony Blinken affirmed the same assurance. The US government, however, still has to seek approval from its Congress should it go to war. ‘ The National Security Council said the MDT should reflect what’s happening in the ground. Manalo said the DFA has begun clarifying talks with the US ‘’on the senior official level.’’   He said the DFA is looking at the US-Japan treaty as a model. Defense officials said the EDCA is not fully implemented. When asked by Marcos on how many percent has the US complied with its commitment on infrastructures at EDCAs, the answer was ‘’25 percent.’’ ‘’This is very slow implementation. It is miserable,’’ Marcos said. The EDCA is intended to bolster the US-Philippine alliance. The agreement allows the United States to rotate troops into the Philippines for extended stays and allows the United States to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases, for both American and Philippine forces. The US is not allowed to establish any permanent military bases. It also gives Philippine personnel access to American ships and planes Marcos asked aloud if there is a need to amend the VFA.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Thursday, September 8 expressed her disappointment at the outcome of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee which recommended the filing of administrative and criminal liability against former agriculture undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian and three ex-officials at the Sugar Regulatory Administration who were involved in the release of Sugar Order No, 4 which President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. had disowned. Hontiveros, a member of the two-manned Senate minority bloc, said that while she concurs with the findings of the committee that there “may have been” a sugar shortage, the panel has put the blame on mere “fall guys.”   The opposition senator has earlier questioned the involvement of Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez and the latter’s questionable testimony on the Senate sugar importation probe. Hontiveros had also earlier urged the panel, chaired by Sen. Francis Tolentino, to subpoena the recording of the Zoom meeting last August 4, attended by no less than President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., former SRA chief Hermenegildo Serafica, former Sugar Board member Aurelio Valderrama Jr., and Rodriguez.   “There was and there is a shortage. Facts don’t lie. The numbers don’t lie. I hope this puts to rest all speculation that the shortage is artificial, na may bode-bodegang asukal. These optics need to be seen against the data — how much sugar do we as a country actually consume, how much are we producing locally,” Hontiveros said. “Pero (But), with due respect to the Chair, tila may ginawang (it seems they were just) fall guys. Of course the President can retract orders and override policy, but I believe Usec. Sebastian when he says he was of the good faith belief that the importation not only was necessary, (and that) it had the support of the Chief Executive,” she said. “If the President wanted to recall SO4, it is perfectly within his province to do so, but to throw everything but the kitchen sink on Usec. Sebastian — na hindi naman kumita, wala namang kinubrang pera (who didn’t earn any money or benefitted from it) discourages government officials from acting with urgency on matters that affect consumers, like tight supply, high prices and inflations,” she lamented.   “In fact, DA insiders say that department officials are now gun-shy about signing any importation documents, ‘Baka ma-Sebastian,’ further exacerbating the food shortage,” the senator further warned. That is why. Hontiveros said the recent raids done on sugar warehouses and derailing the ship carrying imported sugar in Subic made her ask why Rodriguez was not transparent during the Senate probe in the first place. “What are they hiding? What is the real score? Why did the ES need to be subpoenaed and why did he not disclose the August 4 meeting with the President in the first instance?” she said. “In the meantime, ang mga manggagawa ng Coke ay nangangamba kung May trabaho pa bukas, ang mga mamimili ay nanlulumo sa presyo ng asukal (workers at Coca-Cola are worrying if they will still have any job tomorrow, while consumers are reeling at the high prices of sugar),” Hontiveros further noted.

Manila Bulletin,"With the robust trade and economic ties between the two countries, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said Singapore is part of the Philippines’ journey in maintaining its political and economic stability in the Southeast Asian region. Marcos said this during the State Luncheon hosted by Singaporean President Halimah Yacob on September 7, the last day of his two-day State Visit here.   In his speech, the President noted that Singapore is a strong partner at the bilateral and regional levels. “We see our future, of the Philippines as having Singapore beside us, forging ahead to the future,” he said. “Singapore—as part of our journey in maintaining political stability and economic prosperity in the region,” he added. President Halimah has expressed confidence that the ties between Singapore and the Philippines will be even better under Marcos’ leadership.   “Singapore and the Philippines have a shared commitment to ASEAN in the region’s peace and prosperity. The future of the region will depend on how we respond to the opportunities and challenges together,” she said. I am confident that under President Marcos Jr.’s leadership, we will continue to work closely to elevate our relationship to even greater heights,” she added. In response, President Marcos said that the Philippines is one with Singapore in proving to the world that the strength of a country is not in its size but in the quality of people’s lives and the way it forges relations with the members of the community of nations. With the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) becoming the strongest and most viable political aggrupation in the region, Marcos expressed optimism that Philippine-Singapore ties both bilaterally and within ASEAN will continue to grow and become even stronger in the years ahead. “I look forward to closer ties and stronger ties between our two countries. Our candid exchange of views, constructive discussions in the governments that were signed this morning have given us renewed optimism for an even brighter future,” the President said. The Philippines and Singapore are longstanding partners, with official relations starting in 1969, although the cultural, ethnic, and trade connections may have dated back to earlier periods.   Marcos also said that Singapore’s developed economy presents a viable opportunity for thousands of Filipinos. More than 200,000 Filipinos now work and live in Singapore and have been sending a huge amount of annual remittances to their families in the Philippines.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. told Filipinos here that his administration is doing its best so that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) would no longer have to endure separation from their families and kin while working abroad and could instead return to work gainfully their home country. Marcos said this during his meeting with the members of the Filipino community in Singapore on Tuesday evening, September 6.   The President said his government is doing everything to boost the economy, allowing more Filipinos to work in their country instead of going overseas. “Ginagawa [ng Gabinete] ang lahat upang tulungan magpaganda ng buhay ng ating mga kababayan, pagandahin ang ekonomiya para paramihin ang trabaho (The Cabinet is doing everything to help improve the quality of life of Filipinos and improve the economy to generate more jobs),” he said. “Kung talagang kami ay maging matagumpay, para pauwiin na kayo at maaari na kayong magtabaho sa Pilipinas (We want to succeed in this so we can send you home and you can work in the Philippines),” he added. Singapore is home to 200,000 Filipino workers, most of whom are professional, skilled, and semi-skilled expatriates.   President Marcos is in Singapore as part of his two-country inaugural overseas trip. The first leg was in Indonesia from September 4 to 6. During his State Visit to Singapore, the Philippines inked six agreements with their Singaporean counterparts. These are agreements on counterterrorism, data privacy, and migrant workers, among others. In his meeting with the Filipino community, Marcos and Department of Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople announced that Singapore wanted to hire 3,000 more Filipino health workers after witnessing their abilities during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore. Meanwhile, Marcos said his State Visit aims to boost the Philippine economy amid its post-pandemic recovery, which would be easier with the help of how foreigners view Filipinos. “We proactively attract investments in our country in order to accelerate post-pandemic growth and create more jobs in the Philippines,” he said. “Marami tayong kailangang gawin, marami tayong hinaharap na problema ngunit dahil sa ugali ng Pilipino na napapamahal ang ating mga kasamahan, kahit mga dayuhan na hindi taga Pilipinas ay tayo ay gustong tulungan (There’s much to do and we’re facing many problems but because of how we get along with our peers, even foreigners outside the Philippines want to help us),” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robinhood “Robin” C. Padilla is pushing for an inter-agency approach that would prevent the abuse of Philippine internet and other tools for information and communication. Padilla stressed this in Senate Resolution 191 which also seeks an investigation in aid of legislation that would enhance the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 and related laws. “The spread of fake news through means such as social media, messaging mobile applications and SMS has considerably widened the social and political divide among Filipinos resulting in confusion, distrust and proliferation of hate speech,” Padilla said in his resolution.   He cited a Supreme Court ruling that recognizes that ‘’although freedom of expression enjoys an exalted place in the hierarchy of constitutional rights… the exercise of the right is not absolute for it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having equal rights, not injurious to the rights of the community or society.’’ The resolution tasks the Senate committee on public information and mass media led by Padilla to undertake the legislative inquiry. In his resolution, Padilla noted $78 billion has been lost to the world economy every year due to fake news in the “financial, public health and business sector, and also in politics.” He also noted the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution against fake news last April 1, 2022.   “Pursuant to the police power of the State, Congress has the power to enact laws to regulate speech and restrict any form of expression that may convey false information within the bounds of the Constitution in order to curb the spread and abate the ill effects of ‘fake news,'” Padilla pointed. Padilla noted several institutions need to do their part against fake news, including: * The news industry, which needs to promote news literacy and professional journalism; and * Educational institutions, which need to be proactive against online propaganda, misinformation and falsehoods Also, Padilla noted the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and Philippine National Police (PNP) set up a task force against fake news during the Covid-19 pandemic. Only last August, the PNP’s anti-cybercrime group intensified its cyber patrolling against fake news.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senators on Wednesday, September 7 said they support the Inter-Agency Task Force’s (IATF) recommendation to push for an optional face mask policy when outdoors but the government should increase its COVID-19 vaccination program before it enforces a new health protocol.   Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography said he hopes that the IATF’s recommendation liberalizing the government policy allowing optional mask wearing in well-ventilated, non-crowded outdoor areas is based on thorough evaluation by the country’s experts and guided by evidence-based studies. Malacañang is mulling implementing IATF’s recommendation towards the end of 2022, according to Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles   “Since day one of the pandemic, we heavily relied on good science in coming up with policies to address this health crisis,” Go said. “Ngunit bilang Chair ng Senate Committee on Health, hinihikayat ko pa rin ang mga kababayan nating magsuot ng mask, mapa-mandatory o optional man ito. Mabuti na ‘yung nag-iingat tayo habang andyan pa ang banta ng kalabang hindi naman nakikita. Huwag tayong magkumpiyansa. Habang nandiyan pa ang COVID-19, delikado pa rin (but as chair of the Senate committee on health, I would still advise our people to still wear face masks, whether mandatory or optional. It’s better to err on the side of caution while threat is still here. Let’s not be complacent. While the COVID-19 threat is still here, it’s still dangerous),” he pointed out. Nevertheless, Go said all individuals who remain unvaccinated should get themselves inocculated against COVID and those who have yet to get booster shots to avail of the existing programs.   “I also urge all government agencies, LGUs and the private sector to work together and intensify efforts to improve our booster numbers before the end of the year. Bukod sa pag-iingat, bakuna ang tanging solusyon para makabalik tayo sa normal na pamumuhay (Besides being careful, vaccination is still the solution so we can return to normal living),” Go said. Sen. Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa also said he would defer to the authorities’ decision on whether the wearing of face masks outdoor should be made optional. “They are more knowledgeable of these things. Pinagaralan nila yan bago ilabas (They have studied it before they would recommend it),” Dela Rosa pointed out. “But ako, personally, ayoko pa pero may basis sila. Pero ako takot pa rin ako. Magma-mask pa rin ako (I don’t want to go mask-less but they have a basis. But I am still afraid. I will still wear face mask) even if it’s optional,” he added. Sen. Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, however, said he believes the country is ready to go “mask-less.” “Since it is the recommendation of the IATF, then it means that it’s already safe to go outside without wearing face masks. As long as we are fully vaxxed, there might be no need to wear facemasks outdoor,” Estrada said. His brother, Sen. Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito, likewise, agreed with the recommendations of the IATF. “Yes I agree. I believe we only need to wear masks indoors or if there’s a big crowd, so it’s up to every individual’s discretion,” Ejercito said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"George Garcia on Wednesday, Sept. 7, expressed his appreciation to the Commission on Appointments (CA) for confirming his nomination as Chairman of the Commission on Elections (Comelec).  In a statement, he said, he was humbled by the trust, confidence and support bestowed upon him by the country’s elected officials including those in the legislature. Garcia said the Comelec under his leadership aims to equal, if not surpass, the achievements of the 2022 elections. “The Comelec shall undertake institutional reforms in advocating for more responsive election laws, establishing better measures for greater transparency, and opening channels for better engagement with our citizenry,” he said. “As we stand in front of an ever-changing information and technological landscape, the Comelec hopes to meet it with professional and competent personnel who will maintain our level of efficiency without sacrificing credibility,”   He then issued this reminder to the personnel of the poll body: “We perform not just ordinary duties but duties mandated by no less than the Constitution.” “We will not underestimate the work in front of us. The challenges are numerous but I am comforted by the fact that the people of the Comelec are more formidable,” said Garcia. “I further implore the providence of God and the support of the Filipino people as we chart the destiny of the nation through the ballot,” he added.

Manila Bulletin,"Leaders of the House Committee on Ways and Means have underscored the need to complete the government’s proposed Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP), which seeks to overhaul the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. Ways and Means Chairman and Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda, on Wednesday afternoon, Sept. 7, delivered a sponsorship speech before the plenary explaining the benefits of House Bill (HB) 4339 or “Package 4” of the tax reform. This tax reform package was hatched during the previous Duterte administration. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has since cited it as a priority measure during his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) last July 25.   READ: https://mb.com.ph/2022/07/25/mandatory-rotc-bureaucracy-rightsizing-e-government-and-16-other-priority-marcos-bills-listed/ “The bill lowers the number of rates on the financial sector from 83 to 58. That will significantly simplify tax administration and encourage more financial transactions and financial inclusion in the country,” Salceda said in his speech. “If we are able to enact this package as proposed, we will be able to complete the Comprehensive Tax Reform, one of the largest tax reform programs of any country in the world. The program, I am proud to say, is now a case study for model reforms and best practices, in Harvard University, where Senior Vice Chair [Nueva Ecija 1st district Rep. Mikaela] Suansing is a graduate,” Salceda continued. The Bicolano is a principal author of the measure alongside Suansing.   Meanwhile, Suansing, a senior vice chairman of the committee, explained that the measure, in essence, would reduce the tax burden on lower income brackets while higher income brackets would pay more. “There exists an inequitable distribution of the tax burden as investments in equity and long-term instruments–which are more likely to be held by higher-income segments–are subject to lower tax rates compared to short-term investments–which are more likely to be held by low- to middle-income segments. In effect, those who can afford to place long-term instruments pay less taxes compared to working-class individuals who hold short-term investments, which are usually savings deposit accounts,” Suansing said in her own speech. “To rectify this, [HB] 4339 harmonizes the interest income tax rates and gradually reduces these from 20 percent to 15 percent. This will benefit the small savers or those with savings of less than P15,000, which comprise 79 percent of the total number of deposit accounts in the country. In effect, middle-to low-income segments will enjoy a net gain on their savings, while higher-income segments will have to pay more taxes,” she continued. Both also spoke on the removal of Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) from common employment requirements which include National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, birth certificates, diplomas, and the like. “For ordinary Filipinos, we remove the DST on a host of documents usually required for visas, job applications, and other important day-to-day transactions…For OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers), we are also removing the 0.3 percent DST on local remittances. For example, a remittance worth P5,000 will no longer be charged an additional DST of P15,” Salceda said. They also highlighted the lowering of tax rates on passive income.   “[HB] 4339 also aims to adjust the tax rates on passive income, such as interests, royalties, dividends, and capital gains, to a uniform rate of 15 percent. The Stock Transaction Tax will be gradually reduced from 0.6 percent to 0.1 percent to promote investment in the equity capital market,” Suansing continued. The plenary’s consideration for HB 4339 was eventually suspended.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Intending to speed up the country’s post-pandemic recovery, President Marcos has invited Singaporean business leaders to look at the Philippines and consider investing in Asia’s “fastest-rising star.” Marcos said this during the Philippine economic briefing here on Wednesday, September 7.   In his keynote speech, Marcos thanked the event’s guests for showing their interest in the Philippines and said that the country awaits building a better relationship with Singapore. “The Philippines welcomes your investments and looks forward to forging even stronger ties with the Singaporean business community,” he said. “Thank you once again for your interest in the Philippines,” he added. According to Marcos, the Philippines is Asia’s “fastest-rising star” and is projected to outperform its regional peers. He said the next six years under his administration would be grounded on a favorable investment policy environment, sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and a solid and decisive economic team. “We are presently on a steady path to a strong recovery from the pandemic and the robust economic expansion,” the President said. “My administration is committed to establishing an even more competitive business climate conducive to high-value investments. More investments translate to higher economic activity, more jobs, and a better life for all Filipinos,” he added. 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda President Marcos shared with prospective investors his administration’s 8-Point Socioeconomic Agenda that underscores the commitment through broad-based job creation, expansion of digital infrastructure, and the promotion of research and development across the country:   Food security Improved transportation Affordable and clean energy Healthcare Social services Education Bureaucratic efficiency Sound fiscal management “This strategy will enable us to reduce poverty sharply and upgrade the country to upper-middle-income status,” he said. To achieve this, Marcos said the government would exercise fiscal prudence by pursuing the Philippines’ first-ever Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), which will widen the country’s fiscal space to allow for continued investments in public infrastructure and human capital development. “We will expand our high investments and public infrastructure by leveraging our public-private partnerships mechanisms. We will improve interconnectivity through transportation development,” he said. “We will fast-track the development of our railway systems, modernize our airports and seaports, and enhance our road and infrastructure,” he added. Economic drivers In addition, President Marcos said the Philippines would focus on agriculture as it is a critical driver of the economy and a strong driver for growth. “An efficient and modern agriculture sector will ensure food security and reduce poverty incidence,” he said. Marcos added that his administration would reinvigorate the tourism sector through massive investments and travel infrastructure and the promotion of the Filipino brand worldwide. Changing the game According to Marcos, his administration will change the game by implementing structural reforms that allow for wider participation in the country’s industries and, effectively, its economic resurgence. He said that with the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act and economic liberalization measures, “we have expanded the space for foreign investments in joint venture opportunities for industry players employing cutting-edge technologies.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"House Committee on Nuclear Energy Chairman Pangasinan 2nd district Rep. Mark Cojuangco says the Marcos administration must consider entering into bilateral agreements with the United States (US) in order to help the local nuclear energy program get off the ground. Cojuangco had this to say during the nuclear Panel’s first ever panel hearing on Wednesday, Sept. 7. This special committee was formed only last August and is tasked with deliberating on the viability of the country’s nuclear program.  “We need to discuss how nuclear plants will be financed. At the moment with the high fossil fuel prices, the ROI [return on investment] of nuclear plants is very, very short so it’s a very opportune time to be embarking on a nuclear buildout in the Philippines,” Cojuango said on Sept. 7.   He then got into the nitty-gritty of international nuclear law. Specifically, he cited the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Title 10 of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Code of Federal Regulations. “We also need to discuss our bilateral agreements with the United States (US), most specifically, Article 123 of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act of America, which mandates that the US cannot discuss nuclear technology with any other country unless we have a treaty agreement with them regarding Article 123,” the solon noted. Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act is titled “Cooperation with other nations.” It says that “no cooperation with any nation or regional defense organization pursuant to sections 54, 57, 64, 82, 103, 104, or 144 shall be undertaken” until the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC] or the Department of Defense submits the proposed cooperation agreement. The proposal must be approved by the US President, and that the approved proposal must pass through a joint committee of the aforementioned agencies. “We also need with them a bilateral agreement on the US [Title] 10 CFR Part 810 which classifies us as a generally acceptable country as far as nuclear technology exports is concerned,” Cojuango continued. The committee chairman then asked members of his panel to file a House resolution urging the Marcos administration to act immediately on the proposed US cooperation.   “I would request this committee to consider that we pass a resolution of the House urging the administration and the Senate who will finally ratify these agreements to move expeditiously on these because US technology is good technology and we want to have access to that,” he said. One of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos’s key energy plans is kickstarting the Philippines’ nuclear program.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robinhood C. Padilla warned against personalities, organizations or groups that have been opposing the passage of several bills that would give protection to the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). He issued the warning in today’s hybrid hearing of the newly-created Senate migrant workers committee on a bill protecting OFWs that were reported out in the previous 18th Congress. Padilla said in Filipino: “I am going to appeal to those who are blocking these (bills) that maybe there are times when we should accept that we will lose and that time has come.” “Just accept that the happy days of your exploitation are over and let’s give our seamen a chance to have the so-called protection against all kinds of abuses,” he added. He also pointed out that “it is very sad to say that we export nothing but the skills of our OFWs and one of those that we recognized is the seamen.” “In fact, they contributed (to the gross domestic product – GDP) $6-billion in 2021. Think about it, it was a huge amount, a huge help for our economy,” he stressed Senator Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr., likewise, expressed his full support in crafting meaningful legislation that immensely contributes to promoting the rights, safety, protection and welfare of migrant workers.   Revilla said he filed Senate Bill 1104 to protect 217, 233 seafarers “who brave foreign shores and distant lands in search of greener pastures.” He pointed out that the measure was reported out by the Senate committees on labor, employment and human resources development, and foreign relations during the previous Congress. “It is my hope that this Congress will finally witness its enactment into law through our committee on migrant workers,” Revilla said.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday, September 7 said the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee should first review the Zoom recording of the meeting that transpired last August 4 between officials of the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) officials and President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. together with Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez. Hontiveros also expressed her disappointment at the panel’s decision to terminate the hearings on the sugar importation fiasco saying “there are more questions that need to be asked” about the controversy surrounding the botched release of Sugar Order No. 4 which could have authorized the entry of 300,000 metric tons of sugar into the country.   “An effective fact-finding process requires the complete facts. In the case of the sugar fiasco, the truth remains elusive because so many details were left hanging. Bitin (it’s hanging),” Hontiveros said. “I maintain that there are more questions that need to be asked about this fiasco. Former (SRA) Administrator (Hermenegildo) Serafica, as corroborated by former (SRA) Board Member (Aurelio) Valderrama, offered new information that could help explain why (Agriculture) Usec. (Leocadio) Sebastian proceeded with the sugar order,” the Senate minority bloc member added. “Sa tingin ko masusi itong dapat pag-aralan, at kung may ebidensya na dapat magpatotoo ng sinabi nila ito ay dapat tingnan ng kumite. Hahanapin ko ito sa committee report (I think this should be thoroughly studied, and if there is evidence that can corroborrate what they said, this should be studied by the committee. I will look for this in the committee report),” she said.   “I seriously hope that the Chair takes a look at the Zoom recording before drafting the partial committee report,” said Hontiveros, referring to Sen. Francis Tolentino who chairs the Senate blue ribbon panel. She also said it is puzzling why Rodriguez did not disclose the details of the August 4 meeting with Sebastian and the President when he first appeared at the Senate probe and left early at that. “It seems it wasn’t only Serafica who withhold information in the early part of the hearing. This should also come out in the committee report. “I believe the Senate should still conduct a probe on allegations of tongpats, kung meron, pero tingnan din kung sino ang kamay sa likod nitong mga raids ng mga sugar bodega na kalaunan naman ay legitimate pala ang import permits (padding, if there were, but we should also investigate who were behidn the raids of sugar warehouses where it was eventually found out were holding legitimate import permits),” Hontiveros pointed out. Nevertheless, she said the ability of the senators to compel the appearance of the Executive Secretary to appear in the Senate investigation on Tuesday, September 6, was a “victory for the independence of the Senate.” “Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga kapwa ko senador na bumoto para suportahan ang motion ko to (I’m thankful to my co-senators who voted to support my motion to) implead the executive secretary. This shows we cannot be dictated upon by a co-equal branch of government,” she stressed. “I will study the partial committee report very carefully, and will check how it presents these details that have been left hanging. I can only hope that it contains conclusions based on the evidence and based on testimonies of all the stakeholders, not just a few,” the lawmaker reiterated. “Hindi matahimik ang kalooban ko hangga’t hindi napapatunayan kung sino sa kanila ang nagsasabi ng totoo ( I can’t rest until we find out who is really telling the truth),” she emphasized.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday, September 7 described the state visit of President Marcos to Indonesia ad Singapore a success. “The rich haul of trade, economic, and security agreements from Indonesia and Singapore is proof that the good neighbor policy of the President yields benefits that fuels our post-pandemic recovery,’’ Zubiri said.   Because of this successful trips, Zubiri deemed the Philippines is ‘’back on the world stage, and we have no better messenger who can project our strength than the President.’ Marcos has embarked on his first overseas trip as President, traveling to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors Indonesia and Singapore for official state visits with Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Singaporean President Halimah Yacob. Zubiri said the President’s success in diplomatic relations ushered in strengthened ASEAN partnerships that would be crucial in the country’s continued recovery from the pandemic. Other parts of the Senate chief’s statement follow:   “The ASEAN is a rich source of three things we need today: food, fuel and fertilizer. Indonesia is a mineral powerhouse which can supply us with the coal that we need as we transition to a green energy regime. Thailand and Vietnam are the world’s food bowls. Singapore is a creative industry and a financial services hub that benefits from Filipino talent. “Home to 670 million people—bigger than the European Union’s 445 million—and with a GDP (gross domestic product) of P205-trillion, the ASEAN is a market we should fully tap. And the President is to be congratulated for choosing our neighbors as maiden destinations of a diplomatic push that serves the national interest.”    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Manuel “Lito” Lapid is confident the government can address the issue of homelessness among underprivileged Filipino families through the passage of a bill granting free housing through usufruct. In filing Senate Bill No. 1232, or the proposed Free Housing Through Usufruct Act of 2022, Lapid said homeless and underprivileged Filipinos can have access to safe, decent, and affordable housing through a usufruct housing program. The senator said the bill seeks to establish a usufruct housing program to allow beneficiaries free use of the property as a usufructuary, where the State retains the ownership and title of the said property.   In his explanatory note, the senator from Pampanga said that since the early 1990s, various government housing finance programs have offered long-term and low-interest rate loans to indigent Filipinos, but these “unfortunately failed” due to mortgage defaults and poor collection efforts, among others. “Even with the existence of low-cost housing, which should be inexpensive, the same cannot still be afforded by the intended beneficiaries,” Lapid noted. Most times, the lawmaker said beneficiaries of these housing programs would rather sell the housing units instead of using it for their families to earn money.   “Noon pa man, kahit na mayroong nang mga murang pabahay ang gobyerno, kadalasan ay hindi pa rin ito kayang bayaran ng mga benepisyaryo (Even back then, even if the government offers free housing, beneficiaries still cannot afford it),” he pointed out. “Kaya ito pong ating isinusulong na panukalang batas ay layunin nang makapagbigay ng libreng pabahay sa mga mga kapus-palad at mga pamilyang Pilipinong walang tirahan, na walang anumang lupang pagmamay-ari saanman sa bansa, sa pamamagitan ng usufruct (That’s why we are pushing for this measure which seeks to provide free housing to poor Filipinos families who are homeless and have no assets any where in the country through a usufruct),” Lapid stressed. Lapid said the bill would only benefit underprivileged and homeless Filipinos without known ownership of any real property anywhere in the country. However, local government units (LGUs) and other government agencies may extend the benefit to qualified personnel as part of its employee housing program. Also under the measure, charges for utilities such as electricity, water and communication shall be paid by the beneficiaries unless otherwise provided for by the LGU as included in the usufruct contract. The bill also mandates the National Housing Authority (NHA) to provide financial and technical assistance to the LGUs in the implementation of the program. Regardless of ownership of title to the properties subject of the program, the LGU where the housing project is located will be responsible for the management and maintenance of the properties under the program. Lapid, however said, beneficiaries may lose their privilege, should they commit any of the prohibited acts provided under the proposed law which includes—but is not limited to—leasing, renting, selling or in any other matter transferring possession of the awarded property.

Manila Bulletin,"The government should prohibit repeat sexual offenders from teaching in any school in the Philippines, Senator Risa Hontiveros said on Wednesday, September 7. Hontiveros said she is concerned that teachers who were removed or resigned after committing abuse and harassment on students can still transfer and teach in other schools. “Wala tayong nalutas na problema kung hinahayaan nating palipat-lipat lang ang mga abuser (We can’t solve the problem if we allow abusers to just relocate). Sexual predators should never be allowed to be around children,” said Hontiveros, principal author of the Safe Spaces Act.   “Schools should show their students that abusers will be made accountable. This also tells our young people that they will be heard, not dismissed, nor silenced,” she stressed. Hontiveros cited a 2021 article describing how a teacher-predator in St. Theresa’s College Quezon City (STCQC), who had resigned in 2016, was found to have been teaching at Angeles University Foundation (AUF) in the school year 2019-2020. The same report, as of February last year, said the teacher was employed in yet another school. The victim-survivors in both STCQC and AUF confirmed grooming and sexual advances from the same teacher.   “Ilan pa ang mga guro na may mga kaso na pala ng pang-aabuso at karahasan pero imbes na tunay na managot ay nag-iiba lang ng eskwelahan? Ilang mga estudyante na ang nabiktima dahil dito (How many more teachers are facing abuse and violence cases but instead of making them accountable for their actions are just going to other schools? How many students have been victimized because of this)? Predators should get more than a slap on the wrist,” Hontiveros said. At the same time, the senator commended the STCQC for fixing their system in resolving sexual harassment cases. In 2020, she noted that when a student filed an administrative complaint against one teacher-predator, the school created a Student Care Council that processed this case. A month later, the abuser’s employment was terminated. “Ganitong proactivity sana ang inaasahan natin sa lahat ng paaralan (I hope we can have this kind of proactivity among our schools),” Hontiveros said. At the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality hearing on Tuesday, September 6, Hontiveros lamented that there is currently no policy that bars someone, who resigned or who was dismissed due to sexual abuse, from applying in another educational institution. She also said the government should look into Australia’s “Working with Children Check,” an additional layer of screening for adults whose work involves being in the regular company of children. “With the rampant cases of sexual abuse and harassment that we receive and we hear about year after year, it seems necessary to have a similar mechanism in our country,” the senator said. “Our children have been calling on all of us to do better. Hindi sila maayos na pinakinggan kaya’t kinailangan pang ipa-trend sa social media ang hashtag na (Their pleas are not heard that’s why they had to trend on social media the hashtag) #DoBetter. Let’s listen to them this time,” she reiterated.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Leading public and private sector leaders have actively pledged to anchor their respective communication efforts on truth, innovation, and progress amid a reopening economy at the successfully concluded “The Tipping Point,” the 2022 National Public Relations Congress last September 1 and 2 at The Peninsula Manila, Makati City. “Our biggest challenge today is how to turn negative communication into positive communication. Stories that are inspiring, programs and campaigns that are uplifting – these are what we need today. Fellow communicators, we can be the light when things get dark. We are integral to this tipping point,” urged Harold C. Geronimo, APR, President of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP), speaking to nearly 300 on-site delegates and over 1,000 student delegates who joined online. Organized by the PRSP, the PR Congress is the largest congregation of PR practitioners across industries in the public sector, civil society, and students in the Philippines. Recognizing the vital role the public and private sectors both play in communication, Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles delivered the keynote message on behalf of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., while National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan shared his thoughts on how communication drives public-private partnerships in the quest for a higher growth path in the new normal. “The government is serious about fostering a renewed sense of unity in our society. Thus, it launched the One Messaging Policy, which aims to prevent disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through close collaboration among agencies under the executive branch,” Press Secretary Cruz-Angeles said. Meanwhile, homegrown business icons who joined the event’s high-level discussions include Manuel V. Pangilinan, Chairman and President, Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPIC); Kevin Tan, Chief Executive Officer, Alliance Global Group; June Chaye Cabal-Revilla, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer, MPIC; and Christian Gonzalez, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, International Container Terminal Services, Inc. “We all have to work together to fight disinformation. In this profession, we all have to communicate with integrity and a sense of responsibility,” Tan said as part of the Positive Communications in the ‘New Normal’ panel, one of the many engaging sessions during the National PR Congress. Overseas speakers who joined the much-anticipated event were Prita Kamal Gani, President, ASEAN PR Network; Jaffri Amin Osman, Executive Member of the Global Alliance for PR and Communication Management; Fiona Cassidy, President, PR Institute of New Zealand, and Boy Kelana Soebroto, General Chair, PERHUMAS (Indonesia PR Association). “As PR and communications professionals, it is imperative ethics underpin how we operate. Our challenge is to be nimble and adapt to our environment, not get distracted by the newest fad, and be relevant,” Cassidy remarked.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Raffy Tulfo has urged government agencies and different stakeholders from the energy sector to stop the ‘’blame game’’ concerning the persistent and recurring power outages and blackouts in different parts of the country.   During the public hearing of the Senate Committee on Energy chaired by Tulfo on Sept. 6, he said that instead of pointing fingers, all parties involved should work together and exert concerted efforts to solve the issue of brownouts and high cost of electricity. Tulfo made the statement during the hearing as stakeholders from different energy sectors, cooperatives and regulators showed ‘’lack of communication’’ between and among them as they failed to admit their shortcomings on issues involving power outages.   For one, no one admitted their shortcomings when Occidental Mindoro Vice Governor Anecita Apigo-Tayag raised her concern about the persistent brownouts in the province, the longest of which reaches up to 36 hours. Department of Energy Secretary (DOE) Secretary Raphael Lotilla, who was present during the hearing, acknowledged Tulfo’s call to ensure coordination among all involved parties, saying, “This is a difficult time for all of the parties but we will make sure that there is coordination among agencies.” Among those who attended the hybrid hearing were representatives from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), National Electrification Administration (NEA), National Power Corporation (NPC), National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO), Occidental Mindoro Electric Cooperative, INC (OMECO), and Occidental Mindoro Consolidated Power Corp, to name a few. Rather than apply a band-aid fix, Tulfo maintained that the hearing was conducted to “discover a systemic solution” to the problem. “Even before I was elected as a Senator, I have already been receiving numerous complaints regarding the persistent and recurring power outages coupled with high electricity rates that had been adversely affecting the economic activities and livelihood of the people in these areas,” he said. “We are familiar that the energy industry is divided into several sectors, namely, generation, transmission, and distribution. Even though they are distinct and separate industries, each one’s problems affect the others,” he added. Tulfo has expressed concern about the long-standing and persistent power outages in different provinces, which he earlier said continues to threaten the country’s national security.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The National Commission on Indigenous People (NCIP)–an attached agency of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)–became the first agency to have its budget briefing deferred by the House Committee on Appropriations. This, after Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, a member of the House minority bloc, motioned on late Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 6 for the deferral of the discussion on the NCIP’s proposed budget for 2023 worth P1.39 billion. The motion from the Makabayan lawmaker was carried by the presiding chairperson, Negros Oriental 1st district Rep. Jocelyn Limkaichong. However, the budget deliberation on the mother department, the DSWD, along with its other attached agencies, was terminated at the end of the committee briefing Tuesday. A deferral means that the appropriations committee–the panel that has been carrying out the per agency budget deliberations on the proposed P5.268-trillion National Expenditure Program (NEP)–will reschedule a hearing for the concerned agency. “Kaugnay po ito sa red-tagging ng mga issues and vilification kanina, for the record, narinig po natin yung ilan sa mga sagot ng NCIP (This has to do with the red-tagging of issues and vilification earlier, for the record, some of which we heard from the NCIP),” Brosas said after the fact when she was prodded to explain her motion. The militant solon was referring to statements made by NCIP Chairman Allen Capuyan. The appropriations panel will again hold a hearing on the NCIP budget at 9 a.m. Wednesday. While not doomed, the NCIP budget will have to go through the eye of the proverbial needle as the committee had put its foot down, so to speak, with the deferral. The panel will terminate the hearing on the NCIP budget once it is satisfied with the answers of its officials. Independent minority solon, Albay 1st district Rep. Edcel Lagman defended the motion to defer the NCIP budget. “The reason for the deferment of the termination of the budget proposal of NCIP is this: it has a meager budget and it is even asking for more. But, in the process, NCIP is doubling activities that is not within its mandate, using their mere funds. “For example it is engaged in anti-dissident campaign, in the anti-communist campaign which should not be the case. That should be left to the proper agencies,” he explained.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Camarines Sur 3rd district Rep. Gabriel Bordado Jr. is prodding concerned agencies to take action after he unwittingly gave away P10,000 to a poser in a call and text scam. Bordado shared his unsavory experience to House of Representatives reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Sept. 6. The veteran lawmaker said he received a call from a person who introduced himself as Cantanduanes lone district Rep. Eulogio Rodriguez. “Rodriguez”, he said, asked from him a P10,000 donation to help organize a farmers’ convention. Out of his desire to help out a fellow Bicolano and House member, Bordado forked out the P10,000 via GCash.   He then felt something was amiss when he received a text from an alleged House member from Biliran, who this time sought a P70,000 donation. The Camarines Sur solon ignored it. On Tuesday, Bordado spoke to the real Rodriguez and confirmed that the latter never called him up to seek monetary assistance. “So hopefully we can address this concern as soon as possible kasi papasok ang holiday season, nagsimula na tayo ng ‘ber’ months at lumabas na si Jose Mari Chan (the holiday season is here, the ‘ber’ months are here and Jose Mari Chan has come out). “So kinakabahan kami na baka lalong grumabe ang sitwasyon at dapat yung mga concerned entities, agencies ay pumasok na dito (The concerned entities, agencies must step in since we’re worried that the situation might worsen),” Bordado said.

Manila Bulletin,"About $8.5 billion-worth of investment deals have been sealed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. during his first state visit here. This was according to Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles, who said Tuesday night that the amount could translate to at least 7,000 new jobs. During the Jakarta Business Roundtable Meeting on Sept. 5, the President witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding and Letter of Intent covering the following:   $822 million in investments to textiles, garments, renewable energy, satellite gateway, wire global technology, and agrifood. $7 billion in infrastructure for unsolicited private-public partnerships such as a C-5 4-level elevated expressway, and $662 million trade value for supply of coal and fertilizer. “Some are expansions to what are already – the operations that are already ongoing,” Marcos Jr. said in a press conference. He added that some of these investments could be felt immediately, particularly those related to energy, transportation and agriculture industries. During his discussion with the business leaders, Marcos Jr. said the latter, coming from a wide range of sectors, were “very enthusiastic” about doing business in the Philippines.   However, they were not able to come to the Philippines earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he added. “So I said, that already changed, so come to the Philippines,” he said. “They all committed. Many of them are already actually involved in the Philippines. They said they wanted to just expand their involvement,” the President added.    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co believes that the increase in the budget of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) flagship assistance program next year will help lift the country’s poorest of the poor out of poverty, malnutrition, and lack of opportunity and education.  According to Co, who is the House Committee on Appropriations chairman, the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps addresses both the immediate need for social assistance and the strategic goal to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty. The allocation for 4Ps under the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP) is P115.6 billion. This is 7.3 percent higher than the enacted 2022 budget of P107.7 billion. The 4Ps budget next year is expected to reach 4.4 million households, Co said. The entire NEP or proposed spending plan for the country next year is worth P5.268 trillion. The NEP serves as the basis for the eventual budget bill that will emanate from the House of Representatives. The appropriations panel briefing on the proposed P197-billion allocation for DSWD in 2023 was carried out by the appropriations panel Tuesday, Sept. 6. “We commend the President for increasing the support for 4Ps in 2023,” he said. Co noted that DSWD’s role at the height of the pandemic was “immense and immeasurable”. DSWD’s various assistance programs allowed Filipinos to cope with the multiple and sometimes simultaneous crises brought about by lockdowns, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. Enumerating the beneficiaries of DSWD’s programs, Co said that around 700,000 households benefited from its disaster response program; 209,000 households received emergency shelter assistance and cash for work; 3.6 million individuals benefited from its Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations program (AICS); and 3.7 million senior citizens received social pensions. “Your agency performance, at this time, needs not only praise and commendation but full support from the House of Representatives for all your programs and projects for fiscal year 2023,” Co said, referring to DSWD Secretary Erwin Tulfo who led agency officials during the budget briefing.

Manila Bulletin,"Some 30 to 40 percent of the 1.3 million alleged “non-poor” beneficiaries of government’s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) shouldn’t be delisted yet, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Erwin Tulfo told the House Committee on Appropriations Tuesday, Sept. 6. Tulfo, who led DSWD officials during their budget briefing before the House panel, cited information coming from the association of the poverty alleviation program’s beneficiaries themselves. Tulfo recalled how the recent identification of of 1.3 million non-poor out of the 4.4 million beneficiaries of 4Ps triggered complaints left and right. These supposed non-poor beneficiaries are under review as to whether or not they should remain under the program. “Maging yung mga beneficiaries po, nagreklamo po (The beneficiaries themselves are complaining). Because they said, coming from a pandemic, wala naman sigurong yumaman (probably no one became rich),” he said. Removal from the 4Ps list would suggest that the individual is no longer considered poor and thus no longer in need of aid, at least by government standards. “Ang ginawa ko po to make sure na wala pong madede-list tayo, na ika nga mahirap, ang ginawa po natin ay nagpatawag po ako ng pulong sa asosasyon ng 4Ps beneficiaries (To make sure that none of the poor would end up getting delisted, what I did was call a meeting with the association of 4Ps beneficiaries),” he said. “I met them three weeks ago, so I asked them the real status ng mga members po nila (of their members). And they told me sir na (that) out of the 1.3 million, they list[ed] around 30 to 40 percent daw po ay hindi pa dapat alisin sa listahan po namin (who should not be removed yet from our list). “So I ask them if they can come up with a list kung sino po ang pwede nang alisin po namin (that would tell us who we can remove),” the DSWD chief recounted. According to Tulfo, the agency will use not one, not two, but a total of four lists to cross-check the beneficiaries and determine who should graduate as non-poor. These four lists include the 4Ps list, the Listahanan list, and DSWD Municipal Link list. “Yun po ang mga safety net namin…na hindi po basta-basta matanggal yung kawawang tao dahil sa tinamaan siya ng listahanan (That is our safety net…so that no pitiful person would be unduly removed from the list). “Pag siya po ay kasama po talaga doon sa non-poor na, then it’s time to inform them na hindi na po kayo makakasama (But if the person is now included among the non-poor, then it’s time to inform them that they can’t be included in the program anymore),” Tulfo told the solons.

Padilla made the call at the hearing of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality, where he lauded Jerom Canlas for detailing his ordeal at the Philippine High School for the Arts. “Gusto ko lang po saluduhan si Sir Jerom. Ikaw ang bayani dito (I want to salute Sir Jerom – you are the hero). Pinagtatanggol mo rito ang mga bata. Napakaganda ng ginawa mo at magkaroon sana ng lakas loob ang mga magulang din na ang mga anak nila ay biktima na magsalita at mag-file ng kaso (By narrating your experience, you have protected many children. What you did was very good and I hope other students and their parents will have the courage to speak up and file the appropriate charges),” Padilla told Canlas.   “Tandaan natin hindi ito magaan, mga bata ito. Bata ito. Yan ang gusto ko ipaintindi, bata ito, bata ang mga biktima dito, walang kamalay malay, anghel ang mga ito (Let us remember that this is a heavy subject because this involves innocent angels),” he added. During the hearing, Canlas narrated the abuses he underwent while studying at the Philippine High School for the Arts. Canlas earlier called for justice through his Twitter account. Padilla said it is painful to learn that such harassment is being committed against youths because they might carry this burden for the rest of their lives.   “Napakahirap nitong limutan pagka naging biktima ka ng ganitong klaseng abuse (If you become a victim of such abuse, it will be hard to forget). Ito ay mauuwi sa mental health problem, may pangyayaring di ka makatulog dito. Hindi ito maging magaan sa atin lalo sa law enforcement (This may lead to mental health problems. This is quite a burden, especially for law enforcement),” he said. Also, Padilla stressed that under the Safe Spaces Act of 2019, anyone who has knowledge of an incident could file a complaint for harassment, to protect the privacy of a minor. “Sana ay mabigyan ng attention at protection ang bata. Nariyan na batas kung di natin gagamitin (I hope our youths can be given the appropriate attention and protection. This is in the law),” he said. Meanwhile, Padilla reminded schools of the stigma of sexual abuse and sexual harassment, which he has seen in the entertainment industry. He said schools should foster a new culture and new image for the arts, for future generations of Filipino artists. Padilla said he would write Vice President and Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Sara Duterte to ensure safe spaces in schools.   “Gagawa ako personal na sulat kay Madam VP patungkol dito (I will personally write to the Vice President about this),” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on Tuesday, September 6 has “adjourned and terminated” its investigation into the controversial Sugar Order No. 4, the botched order that could have authorized the importation of 300,000 metric tons of sugar into the Philippines.   Senator Francis Tolentino, who chairs the Senate Blue Ribbon panel, announced the termination of the investigation after Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez finally appeared at the hearing after the members of the committee voted to issue a subpoena against him. Senate President Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri broached the idea of already concluding the hearings to “hasten the proceedings.”   “I would suggest doing justice to the farmers and stakeholders. Maybe, we can terminate the hearings, come up with a quick resolution of the case, approve it before the break and if these cases are necessary to be filed, let us file them so that they have their day in court,” Zubiri said during the hearing. “If we feel there is malfeasance, misfeasance, or any violation to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, let us come up already with the findings and proceed with filing the cases,” the Senate leader stressed. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III agreed on Zubiri’s suggestion saying the committee can come up with one final report.

Manila Bulletin,"Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri today September 6 thanked the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee chaired by Senator Francis Tolentino for a “a job well done.” “He handled the hearing with professionalism, Napakabilis na nakuha ang mga detalye sa witnesses (He got the details from witnesses very fast). Nagpapasalamt ako sa kanya na dininig nya ang aking isyu last month (I thank him for conducting the public hearing the issue I brought out about the sugar importation fiasco),” Zubiri said.   Last month, Zubiri delivered a privilege speech denouncing an order of the Sugar Regulatory Board (SRB) to import 300,000 although SRB records showed that there are 127,000 metric tons of sugar in warehouses which means that there is no sugar shortage. Malacanang had claimed that it directed the SRB to draft an import plan but what came out as Sugar Order No. 4 allowing the importation of 300,000 metric tons. Zubiri said the Senate would act on the possible Senate committee report to be issued by the Tolentino committee. “If charges are to be filed, then so be it. We will make sure na di maulit ito (that it won’t happen again),” he added. Zubiri said that in all the meetings on the Sugar Regulatory Administration, “there are recommendations that will make changes with the system.” He said that the Senate hopes to avert the “Sugar Order No. 4” incident at SRB where there would be “no government intervention.” ‘’Ibigay sa ating high demand users (We will support the high-demand users). Example Coca Cola para wala nang isyung tongpats (Example is Coca-Cola because if we don’t do it there will always be the issue of corruption),’’ he added. Zubiri cited Sugar Order No. 4 which chose the importers and took away the filing of performance bond requirement. ’’The bond is there to protect the Philippine government to protect sugar cane farmers and there would be no issue of importation),’’ he pointed out. Zubiri, whose family traces its origins to the sugar cane-plantation areas of Negros Occidental, emphasized that any importation should be just right so as not to affect the farmers. He is a Bukidnon resident.   “Ang gusto ng Pangulo di po dehado ang mga magsasaka, unahin natin local stocks at pag ubos na dyan na tayo magi-import (The President wants sugar cane farmers to be disadvantaged…ensure that importation should only be done when local stocks are depleted),” he said. “Itong hearings na ito ay napakaimportante kaya nagpapasalamat tayo kay chairman Tolentino (These hearings are very important and I thank chairman Tolentino for it).

Lacson slammed her for her statement during a Senate plenary session that the Communist Party of the Philippines/New People’s Army/New Democratic Front (CPP/NPA/NDF) is “not an enemy of the State,” Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda assured her colleagues in the Senate that she is an ally of the Senate “in bringing true and lasting peace to our country through exclusively non-violent means.” “Senator Legarda is a friend and I respect her opinion but I cannot for the life of me agree with her stand,” Lacson, former Senate national defense committee chairman, had said in a press statement.   Making clear her stand on the unresolved decades-old insurgency during the Senate plenary session, Legarda stated that ‘’that I denounce, condemn all forms of violence and terrorism, and call for an end to armed conflict.’’ She is a colonel in he Philippine Air Force (PAF) Reserve Corps. “I am in favor of peace talks that are built upon a genuine desire to come to an agreement, which are within our democratic framework and in accordance with all our laws,” Legarda stressed. The Communist Party of the Philippines, through its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), has been staging war against the established Philippine government for the past decades.   For over half a century, armed conflict has hindered our nation’s development. I know that we all share the same dream to build a more prosperous nation, to give a more comfortable life for all Filipinos. As an advocate for peace for many decades, I believe the best way to achieve this is by building mutual understanding through good faith discussions, through which we can find that we have more that unites us than what sets us apart,’’ Legarda said. “I would also like, at this juncture, to commend the women and the men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines for their service to our nation. For years, as a reserve officer of the Philippine Air Force, I have worked to support the AFP through legislation and appropriations,” she stressed. “Amid the strong positions on this issue, Mr. President, I would like to call upon our countrymen to pursue our common goal of bringing true and lasting peace to our country through exclusively non-violent means. Premised on a genuine commitment to cease hostilities, let us join together and give peace another chance,” she added.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Alan Peter Cayetano on Monday, September 5, raised the continued deferral of the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT), saying the University of the Philippines (UP) cannot keep putting off the entrance exam since it gets the lion’s share of funds among the country’s State Universities and Colleges (SUC).   “Kapag walang UPCAT, dalawa ang biktima dito, yung bata and yung university (If there’s no UPCAT, there are two victims here, the student and the university). Why? Because UP gets 23.41 percent of the budget of all the SUCs. Almost one fourth of their budget goes to UP – meaning greater funds, greater power, greater responsibility,” Cayetano said in a manifestation during the Senate session. “Hindi pwede ang petiks-petiks diyan at hindi na pwedeng hindi mag-UPCAT (They can’t afford to be complacent and not administer the UPCAT). This is so urgent,” he further said. The UP has suspended the UPCAT since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has been selecting students based on their high school grades. Since the pandemic situation in the countey has improved, Cayetano filed Senate Resolution No. 157 on August 25, 2022 strongly urging UP to administer the UPCAT for the next academic year 2023-2024 to make the admission process more holistic. But on Friday last week, UP announced that it has suspended for the third year its college entrance exam for incoming freshmen.   Cayetano warned disregarding the UPCAT will sideline deserving students who may not necessarily have the highest grades but can pass the entrance test. “Kung y’ung grades lang titingnan mo (if you just look at their grades), you will not get the best of the best. Pinapatay mo mga pangarap ng mga bata (You will kill a child’s dream),” he said. Prior to this, Cayetano led the organizational meeting of the Senate Committee on Science and Technology and briefly touched on the unsatisfactory UPCAT passing of Philippine Science High School (PSHS) students of only 60.55 percent. This ranks poorly compared to the school’s 97 to 99 percent passing rate during pre-pandemic years, according to Cayetano. “The Philippines Science High School system has 12 schools and during the administration of UPCAT, they have 97 to 99 percent or almost a hundred percent passing. Nung nawala ang UPCAT, only 60.55 percent ang pumapasa (When they removed the UPCAT, only 60.55 percent passed),” Cayetano said. “Two years na ‘to. Many science high schools around the country are complaining that the best of the best are not getting in kasi mali ang sistema (because the system is not working),” he lamented.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robin Padilla favored yesterday the start of discussions between China and the Philippines on possible joint gas and oil exploration development in the contested West Philippine Sea (WPS).   Stopping the discussions would not do good to the Philippines which is thirsty for the inflow of imported oil whose cost has become expensive and has negative impact on the Philippine economy, Padilla said in his privilege speech in today’s plenary session. How long should the Philippines wait which has rich reserves that are untapped, he asked. Padilla cited a recent statement Liu Jianchao, a high ranking Chinese, that China is ready for discussions on a joint gas and oil development in the WPS. `‘’Tiwala po ako sa ating mahal na Pangulong Bongbong Marcos na hindi nya pababayaan ang soberanya at ang ating Saligang Batas (I trust in Philippine Marcos that he would respect our sovereignty and our Constitution),’’ he added.   Hs said government officials must have an open mind and adopt diplomacy in approaching the problem because nothing would happen if it does not do anything. Senator Ramon ‘’Bong’’ Revilla stressed that the WPS in the country’s ‘’’gold mine’’. When Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri suggested that the Philippines look for oil and gas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), Padilla said he was told that there are some 72,000 hectares in protected area for possible oil and gas development. In case there are discussions for a joint oil and gas exploration agreement, Senator Risa Hontiveros of the Senate minority bloc said China should respect the historic 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in the Hague, the Netherlands, that rejected China’s ‘’historic’’ claim over the South China Sea. The WPS is part of the South China Sea. Hontiveros also said China should stop dredging the sea bed for possible land reclamation in the contested area.   Earlier talks had seen Filipino negotiators insisting on the constitutional 60-40 investment sharing provision with the 60 percent capital shouldered by and eventual profits going to the Philippines. Many Chinese vessels are in WPS, scaring Filipino fishermen away from their fishing grounds. Padilla, during a weeklong hop in the islands in the WPS area, said he had seen big Chinese vessels, some of them ‘’industrial’’ sized.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives Committee on Information and Communications Technology wants to consolidate the E-Government and the E-Governance bills that President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos had designated as priority measures. In an attempt to merge the two priority measures, the panel carried a motion to form a technical working group (TWG) to do just that.  During a committee hearing on Monday, Sept. 5, chairman and Navotas City lone district Rep. Tobias Tiangco approved Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda’s motion to form the TWG. “I think we should consolidate both bills under a single law or measure. And by way of motion, I ask that the honorable chair be authorized to form a TWG to discuss further the various elements of both bills and how these bills can be merged,” Salceda said in his motion. The panel’s agenda for the day included deliberations for six House bills (HBs) pertaining to the E-Governance Act, also known as “Institutionalizing the transition of the government to e-governance in the digital age, appropriating funds therefor”. These are HB Nos. 3, 1809, 2902, 2978, 3563, and 3612. Meanwhile, there were five bills on the topic of the E-Government Act or “Establishing the e-government, defining its powers and functions, appropriating funds therefor”. These are HB Nos. 277, 2683, 2731, 2963, and 34211. One measure, HB No.2568, “Requiring the digitalization of frontline services of all government agencies and appropriating funds therefor”, also falls under the E-Government Act umbrella. Section 39 of the House rules define a TWG as follows: “Technical working groups may be created and tasked to ensure that measures and their corresponding committee reports are carefully crafted and faithfully express the ideas, sentiments and consensus of the committee relative to said measures and reports.”  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"As government caretaker while President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is away on state visits to neighboring Asian countries this week, Vice President Sara Duterte on Monday, Sept. 5, got a security briefing from the heads of the country’s security sector. “We discussed the peace and order situation in our country and how we can maintain the security of our country until President Marcos comes back from his state visits,” she told the media after reading a prepared media statement about the lunch meeting.   She added that they also discussed the collaboration and coordination between the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and how the two offices support the Office of the President (OP) and the “respective agencies and departments” of the security sector. Though she said there were no specifics discussed and was no terror threat, she and the heads of the security sector “reassured each other na (that) the OP, the OVP, and the entire government is behind all of them sa kanilang trabaho (in their job) against terrorism.”   “That’s why I mentioned in my prepared statement and that was communicated also to them that there should be no mercy to terrorists and criminals,” Duterte added. The Vice President hosted a lunch meeting with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and its major services—the Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force (PAF), and the Philippine Navy—at the DepEd central office in Pasig City.  She also met with the chiefs and official representatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and officials from the OVP and the DepEd.   Aside from national security issues and ensuring how to maintain the security of the country while Marcos is away on state visits to Indonesia and Singapore this week, Duterte shared that she also discussed the “specific issues” of the departments. With the BFP, the Vice President said that she discussed how to train the learners, while she also delved into the rape case of the four teachers in Camarines Sur with the PNP. Marcos will be out of the country until Wednesday, Sept. 7, leaving Duterte as government caretaker. This is the first time in 12 years that the Chief Executive has appointed the Vice President as caretaker while he was away on foreign trips.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Grace Poe has filed a bill that seeks to set up online transactions in government offices to get rid of long lines. Senate Bill No. 334 or the proposed E-Government Act of 2022 seeks to mandate government agencies on the efficient delivery of services, allowing the public to perform transactions through their mobile phones or desktop computers.   “Filipinos certainly deserve the convenience of accessing government services and information at their fingertips. Amid the new normal, swift and reliable access to state and local institutions anytime, anywhere is more crucial than ever,” Poe said. E-gov’t master plan Under the proposed bill, the public can apply for claims or loans, pay taxes, renew licenses and engage in related government transactions without having to leave their houses or offices. “Waiting in line for hours for cash aid, loans, benefits and the like should be a thing of the past. We must spare our people, especially the elderly and persons with disability, from this unacceptable strain in the hands of the government,” Poe said. SB 334 tasks the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to establish and promote an e-government master plan (EGMP) to serve as a framework for the rollout of online services by agencies. The DICT secretary will head the e-government initiative while each local government unit (LGU) will have an information officer to supervise the adoption of the master plan and report compliance. The EGMP will deal with archives and records management system, online payment system, citizen front-line delivery services, and public finance management and procurement system. The bill also provides for the review and revision of the master plan every three years. The EGMP was first crafted under Executive Order No. 47, issued by then President Benigno Aquino III in 2011, which directed the then Information and Communications and Technology Office to provide an ICT infrastructure, systems and resources to support “efficient, effective, transparent and accountable governance.” According to Poe, her bill aims to continue government efforts to “harmonize and integrate ICT” in the implementation of the master plan, which was first implemented from 2013 to 2016.   ADVERTISING Another six-year EGMP was released for 2016 to 2022, which the DICT updated this year, she said. For Poe, the digital transformation of processes involved in delivering services was more urgent now with physical interaction still limited due to COVID-19, making reliable access to government services “within the confines of our homes… more crucial than ever.” Over the years, several bills were approved to make business transactions more convenient for the public, including Republic Act No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018. Signed on May 28, 2018, it was part of the Duterte administration’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda to increase competitiveness and the ease of doing business in the country. It sought to reduce the processing times of business transactions in government agencies and government-owned and -controlled corporations to three working days for simple transactions, seven days for complex transactions, and 20 working days for highly technical transactions. RA 11032 also required all LGUs to come up with a unified business application form to streamline procedures for the issuance of business permits, clearance and other types of authorizations. At the same time, LGUs were mandated to set up one-stop shops to facilitate business permits applications.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"A bill penalizing “political prostitutes,” or politicians who frequently switch political parties, has been filed in the House of Representatives where ironically, changing one’s political affiliation has become the norm after every election. Through his House Bill No. 1536 or the proposed Anti-Political Prostitute Act, Surigao del Rep. Robert Ace Barbers seeks to ban political turncoatism which, according to him, has become a “popular practice in Philippine politics, especially during [the] election period,” thus weakening the party system and undermining democracy.   “Due to a lack of ideological grounds…, [party] members tend to shift to another party when [an] opportunity comes or when there is a need for them to survive. They change political (parties) to continue access to valuable resources of the president. They will drop every ounce of principle in exchange for power,” he said. Barbers’ bill defines political turncoatism as “the change of political party affiliation during an elective official’s term of office.” It also applies to those who switch parties within a year before or after an election, including independent or party list candidates, regardless of whether or not they won. Exemptions Not covered by the bill are politicians who switched parties before it took effect; those whose parties were abolished, merged or involved in a coalition; or those who were expelled provided their acts do not constitute political opportunism. Political turncoats can be reported by registered voters to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) whose members will act on the complaint. For elected public officials, the penalty will be forfeiture of office while for independent candidates, or members of a political party or party-list group, it will be a ban from running in the next two succeeding elections. For winning or losing elective officials, they will be disqualified from appointment to any post in a public or government office for three years after the expiration of their current term or the office they vied for. Refund with surcharge If they join a new political party, they will not be allowed to assume any executive or administrative position in addition to being ordered to refund all the money they received from the party, plus 25 percent surcharge. Should the proposed bill be passed into law, all political parties must submit to the Comelec a complete list of their members, updated every six months. Failure to comply with the requirement will mean the suspension of their accreditation for one year and eventual cancellation for a succeeding offense. According to Barbers, his bill will “ensure a genuine party system and promote party loyalty, discipline, and adherence to ideological principles.”   ‘Societal change’ “This will also provide us hope that societal change can be achieved for a progressive nation,” he said. Barbers’ bill, however, may face rough waters under the 19th Congress where the dominant party, Lakas-CMD, has seen its ranks increase with the defection of around 30 lawmakers less than two months after the new administration took over on June 30.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said Monday that new Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Lt. Gen. Bartolome Vicente Bacarro is the “right leader” for the country’s military.   Marcos made the remark during the change of command ceremony at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. “It is certain that we have chosen the right leader in General Bacarro to lead the AFP as it marches forward and undertakes a new journey that will eventually pave the way for a much improved and stronger AFP in the days ahead,” Marcos said in his speech. ADVERTISING “I am sure that we will all now know that we have a reliable partner in the AFP under the helm of General Bacarro as we commence the difficult undertaking of rebirth and restoration of the Republic, transforming the country into a haven that is safe, secure, peaceful, and prosperous for all present and future Filipinos to enjoy,” the President added. According to Marcos, Bacarro’s “strong presence, administrative and operational proficiency, unmatched discipline, and unwavering commitment” will be helpful in his work at the helm of the AFP. “I know that you know well that the journey will not be an easy one. It will be sometimes treacherous, always complex. It will be difficult and at times seemingly unbearable,” Marcos said. “But with the AFP beside us, assisting and putting in place the fundamental prerequisites for nation-building, we shall overcome and emerge victorious in the end,” he added. Bacarro previously led the AFP-Southern Luzon Command. He graduated in the upper quartile of the Philippine Military Academy “Maringal” Class of 1988. Bacarro will be the first AFP chief of staff to be given a fixed three-year term, citing the Republic Act No. 11709 signed by former President Rodrigo Duterte.   R.A. 11709 sets a fixed three-year tour of duty for the AFP chief of staff, vice chief of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the major service commanders, unified command commanders, and inspector general “unless sooner terminated by the President.” Bacarro received the country’s highest military award for combat, the Medal of Valor, after leading an operation to repel a communist guerrilla attack in Isabela in 1991.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. reminded the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Monday not to allow dishonesty and abuse to influence their work.   At the 121st Police Service anniversary celebration in Camp Crame, Marcos said the police force’s role in the preservation of peace and order is “pivotal” in the administration’s plans to change the lives of Filipinos. “I enjoin all of you to give it your best as you always have without sacrificing your integrity as servants of the people… Let us continue to conduct our business with utmost integrity and accountability,” Marcos said in his speech. “And let us not allow even a hint of dishonesty and abuse to enter into that narrative. You are the vanguards of peace you are and that you set the example of the kind of leaders that we need to overcome the hindrances of today,” the President added. Marcos likewise urged the police force to support the PNP leadership.“Chief PNP General [Rodolfo Azurin Jr.’s] able governance will serve as the impetus that would further develop and strengthen the PNP in his resolve to promote goodwill and harmony in the heart of our motherland,” Marcos said. “The obstacles in front of you will be difficult; that does not try to say that they will not. They might be overwhelming at times. They will put your results and patience to the test. Baseless and unfair criticism will be forthcoming, and this will come from the center, the left, and the right,” he added. The PNP has previously been criticized over the implementation of controversial policies such as the campaign against illegal drugs of the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos last month said the Marcos administration would continue the war on drugs. “The war against drugs will be as intensive as before on the basis of my oath as a public official in accordance with the Constitution,” Abalos said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Calling them “vanguards of peace”, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Monday reminded the Philippine National Police (PNP) that the use of force in their operations must be reasonable, justifiable and carried out only when necessary. During the 121st Police Service Anniversary celebration at Camp Crame, Marcos Jr. said the PNP’s application of its mandate must be “firmly grounded on moral principles, integrity, accountability and honesty” to ensure continued public rapport and support.   “For instance, the use of force must always be reasonable, justifiable and only undertaken when necessary. Execution of authority must be fair, it must be impartial,” Marcos Jr. said. “It must be devoid of favoritism and discrimination, regardless of race, gender, social economic status, political affiliation, religious belief and the like. It is only then that you can effectively sustain with great respect and wide support the authority that you possess as uniformed servicemen of the Republic,” he added. Nonetheless, Marcos believes that the PNP has “done well and continue to do so in this regard.” “You have proven you’re worthy of the uniform that you sport and the office that you represent, especially during these terrible times when disorder and lawlessness occurs anytime because of many other serious concerns in our society,” Marcos said. Further, the President reminded the PNP to conduct its business with utmost integrity and accountability. “Let us not let us not allow even a hint of dishonesty and abuse to enter into that narrative. You are the vanguards of peace. You set the example of the kind of leaders that we need to overcome the hindrances of today,” Marcos Jr. said. “As we forge ahead and continue with the journey, I am thankful to know that in this administration we have the PNP beside us serving as a reliable partner in making sure that the path we’ll be walking is conducive to the ultimate transformation we have long been working for and aspiring to,” he added. Marcos Jr. likewise praised newly-appointed PNP chief Police Lt. Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr., saying the right leader for the police force was chosen.   “I am confident that we have chosen the right leader in his person to help the PNP so that it continues to evolve, continues to grow and to develop into a well balanced institution, effective and capable of steadfast rendering faithful service to our sovereign nation and all its citizens,” Marcos Jr. said. “With our new PNP chief at the helm, the upgrade of the PNP will be inevitable. The police force shall emerge stronger, more accessible and more responsive, more inclusive, more relevant than ever,” the President added.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Ronald dela Rosa on Sunday warned that the so-called “ninja cops,” or dirty police officers involved in illegal drugs, are on the prowl for ways to return to active service due to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s perceived lack of interest in pursuing the previous administration’s brutal drug war. “They were just waiting for [former] President Rodrigo Duterte to leave Malacañang,” Dela Rosa said in a radio interview.   “They will try to find ways to be reinstated using whatever connections they [can] find. You know in our system of government, they try to find ways,” he added. Dela Rosa, chair of the Senate public order and dangerous drugs committee, called on the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the National Police Commission, and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to prevent former police officers, who were sacked for their links to the illegal drug trade, from being reinstated. The senator, a former PNP chief, was the first implementer of Duterte’s bloody war on drugs and it was under his watch when more than 6,000 Filipinos were acknowledged to have been killed in an effort that, the government admits, did not stop narcotics trafficking in the country. ‘Emboldened’ “They (drug syndicates) became emboldened toward the end of the Duterte administration,” he claimed. The drug syndicates, he said, apparently thought that the PNP and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency were “not as resolute as before” in combatting the drug menace. Dela Rosa, however, said the public should give the President and his security officials the “benefit of the doubt” and suggested that his “template” solved a social and health problem that lingers in many countries. “We cannot dictate and tell them to copy the template [of the previous administration]. They have their own plans. But they should implement those plans so [the campaign] will be felt on the ground,” he stressed.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Philippine foreign policy is Philippine business. This was the reminder of opposition senators to Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on Friday after the envoy “reminded” the Philippines to adhere to the “One China” policy amid the diplomatic tensions sparked by the visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.   “Our foreign policy is determined solely by us,” Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III, former chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, told the Inquirer. “We have in the past manifested our observance of the One China policy. We have not officially changed this policy … Hence, no need for any ‘reminder,’” added the senator. “I repeat,” he stressed, “reminder or no reminder, we solely determine our foreign policy.” In a television interview last week, Huang reiterated that “there is only one China in the world” and that the self-ruled island of Taiwan “is an inalienable part of China’s territory.” “It is our hope that the Philippine side will strictly abide by the One China principle and handle all Taiwan-related issues with prudence to ensure sound and steady development of China-Philippines relations,” Huang said. Respect PH autonomy Senator Risa Hontiveros had more withering remarks. “It is unfortunate that the good ambassador felt the need to impose his will on our country, disrespecting our agency and autonomy,” Hontiveros said in a statement. The Chinese diplomat, she said, “should not presume to lecture the Philippines as to how we should pursue our foreign policy objectives.” “The Philippines is a sovereign state, following an independent foreign policy,” Hontiveros maintained.   “In fact, (Huang) shouldn’t pontificate on such policies, especially considering that his country stubbornly and steadfastly refuses to recognize a decision rendered by an international arbitral court, and ignores and flouts international law in the West Philippine Sea when it suits (Beijing’s) interests,” she said. As a free country, Hontiveros told Huang that the Philippines may “review, amend or modify our foreign policy” anytime without seeking the permission of other countries. Rising tensions While the two senators do not have real powers over the country’s foreign policy which remains under the sole discretion of the President, the remarks appeared to be a nod to the country’s sizable Chinese Filipino community. Chinese families have been immigrating to the country for centuries, but the largest waves were those of Kuomintang supporters, who fled a great drought and sociopolitical abuses in China from the 1950s to 1980s. In 1975, Manila and Beijing established formal diplomatic relations with the Philippines adopting the so-called One China policy and ending its diplomatic relations with Taiwan (Republic of China). Both Taipei and Manila, however, maintained representative offices that served and continue to serve as de facto embassies. On Wednesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the Philippines was “concerned with the rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait, just north of the Philippines,” and called for “restraint by all parties concerned.” READ: PH calls for caution over Pelosi visit to Taiwan “The Philippines adheres to the One China policy. The Philippines urges restraint by all parties concerned. Diplomacy and dialogue must prevail,” the DFA said in a statement issued on Thursday.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The newly installed chief of the Philippine National Police wants an audit of the deployment of police officers on the field, as it boggles his mind why they are still conducting anti-narcotics operations in areas already declared “drug-free.” Police Lt. Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. wondered, for instance, why law enforcers were still ordered to operate recently against drug suspects in the municipality of Adams, Ilocos Norte, when supposedly it had already been swept clean of drug users and pushers.   Adams, the smallest town in President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s home province, was categorized as drug-free in March 2018, two years after then President Rodrigo Duterte launched his war on illegal drugs, which killed thousands of suspects and prompted the filing of cases accusing him and his subordinates of crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court. In his speech during the command turnover ceremony at Camp Crame, Quezon City, on Wednesday, August 3, Azurin said he would order a review of the requirements to deploy police units on the field, saying compliance rates reported by lower units were apparently “no longer applicable in some areas.” Under Duterte, the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) classified barangays as either low or high priority in determining whether they would be subjected to “clearing operations” by the PNP or the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). For a barangay to be considered cleared of drugs, there should be a total absence of drug dens or laboratories, as well as zero drug users, pushers, dependents, protectors and financiers, among others, according to DDB Board Resolution No. 4, Series of 2021.  The village must also have an active Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council, which implements programs on drug awareness, preventive education and information, and processing desks for voluntary and compulsory drug treatment and rehabilitation. Barangays that meet these requirements are declared “drug-cleared.” They will only be certified “drug-free” once they consistently show zero illegal drug incidents on record. Drug-cleared and drug-free barangays are supposed to undergo vetting by the Regional Oversight Committee on Barangay Drug Clearing, with the PDEA regional director sitting as its chair.   60-percent cleared Based on PDEA data, a total of 25,361 barangays in the country, or 60 percent of the total, have been categorized as drug-cleared as of June. On the other hand, 6,573 barangays, comprising 15.6 percent of the total, were either drug-free or “drug-unaffected,” which means the barangay has never been beset by any illegal drug activity. Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos earlier said the Marcos administration would continue the war on drugs, but he did not answer directly when asked if it would be as violent as Duterte’s, only that it would be done “relentlessly on the basis of the Constitution.” In his speech on Wednesday, Azurin made a similar pledge. “I emphasize that our war on drugs shall be relentlessly continued—regardless of who gets hurt and who gets caught,” he said.Azurin said the PNP would conduct an audit of the drug situation in the country, “focusing on the areas where known drug personalities were killed.”  Official government data showed that a total of 6,252 people were killed in what were counted as legitimate drug operations from July 1, 2016, to May 31, 2022, spanning almost the entirety of Duterte’s term. Anti-insurgency Over the same period, a total of 345,216 people were arrested, of whom 15,271, or 4 percent, were considered “high-value targets.” Azurin said the PNP would partner with other government agencies to ensure that the drug supply chain in the country “would be reduced, if not cut totally.” On Wednesday, the new PNP chief also posed questions as to why police officers were still being required to conduct “major and minor combat [anti-insurgency] operations” in places already declared cleared of rebel forces. “Thus, I am directing the QUAD (referring to the PNP’s operations, intelligence, investigation and community relations units) to come up with a more sustainable concept of operations, especially on our war on drugs, local communist terrorists, terrorism, human trafficking, kidnap for ransom and other crimes perpetrated by organized crime groups,” he said.  Before becoming the 28th PNP chief, Azurin headed the Northern Luzon Police Area, composed of the regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon and the Cordillera Administrative Region. His tour of duty will last for more than a year, ending when he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 56 on August 24, 2023. A graduate of the Philippine Military Academy, Azurin is a member of the “Makatao” Class of 1989.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Agriculture (DA) has expanded the distribution of fuel subsidies to benefit more agricultural producers amid rising pump prices. “The program will therefore cover all farm machinery with attached engine, that is being used for crop production as well as motorized banca. All farm machinery enrolled under the program should have proof of ownership,” the DA said in a memo signed by Agriculture Undersecretary and chief of staff Leocadio Sebastian.   All concerned DA offices, including the Sugar Regulatory Administration, National Tobacco Administration, Philippine Coconut Authority, Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority, and Philippine Center for Post-harvest Development and Mechanization that distribute farm machinery were tasked to submit a master list of eligible recipients and corresponding machinery to regional field offices. They were also directed to coordinate with local governments to conduct information dissemination, fast-track validation and encoding of eligible beneficiaries in the registry systems, generate the final list of beneficiaries, and distribute cash cards to eligible participants. 30% discount Beneficiaries under the subsidy program are entitled to a 30-percent fuel discount, or a maximum of P3,000 per farmer or fisher, upon the purchase of gasoline or diesel from designated or contracted gas stations. The discount cards will be issued by the DA in partnership with the Development Bank of the Philippines. In March, the DA issued guidelines on providing fuel discounts to all registered corn farmers and fishermen to cushion the impact of higher fuel prices that had been aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The initial budget of P500 million for the initiative was later increased to P1.1 billion to benefit corn farmers using machines for production and preparation, post-harvest activities, and fisherfolk using motorized boats for fishing.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday morning visited the wake of his distant uncle, former President Fidel V. Ramos, at the Heritage Park in Taguig. Speaking to reporters after he paid his last respects to the former president, Marcos Jr. said he told former first lady Amelita Ramos that her husband was “a symbol of stability after all the tumultuous events of 1986.”   Ramos is considered a hero of the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled the two-decade rule of the President’s father, deposed strongman Ferdinand E. Marcos. The President arrived past 10:30 a.m. and was accompanied by Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez and Special Assistant to the President, Secretary Antonio Lagdameo Jr. Ahead of his visit, Marcos Jr. sent a funeral wreath on Wednesday night. Ramos died at the Makati Medical Center on July 31 at the age of 94. READ: Former president Fidel Ramos dies at 94 “We clearly have suffered a loss for our country. But the memories of him will be good because of all the good work he did for the Philippines,” Marcos Jr. said, referring to the former president, also popularly known by his initials, FVR. Family event Marcos Jr. also described the wake as a “family event,” since Ramos was a cousin thrice removed. Ramos’ grandmother, Crispina Marcos-Valdez, was a sibling of the President’s great-grandfather, Fabian Marcos. Marcos Jr. said he offered condolences to Ramos’ wife, popularly called Ming, who will turn 95 years old in December, and spoke about how Ramos brought “calm” and “stablility” after the 1986 People Power Revolution. “Thank you very much for coming,” Ming Ramos said. “I realized we have so many friends. He (Ramos) worked hard. We also tried to work hard, and now he deserves the rest that he needs.” Ramos is scheduled to be inurned on August 9, 10 a.m., at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, where all former presidents of the Philippines are entitled to be buried.   Period of national mourning Aside from being a career military official and former commander in chief, Ramos also served as a young officer in the Philippine Expeditionary Force sent to Korea in the 1950s. The President declared a 10-day period of national mourning from July 31 to August 9 following the death of Ramos and ordered, in Proclamation No. 33, that the national flag to be flown at half-staff in all government offices during the period of mourning. “It is fitting to devote a period of national mourning to pay tribute to an esteemed leader who has dedicated his life to public service and has left a lasting mark on our country,” Marcos Jr. said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"As mayors and governors now have the burdensome task of implementing programs and projects that otherwise should be done by agencies of the national government, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. called on local government units (LGUs) to be open to public-private partnership (PPP) as a mode of financing undertakings in their provinces, cities, and towns. “I think this is the way forward, and I encourage all our [LGUs] to be open to the possibilities of PPPs, especially in your areas,” he said in a brief meeting with officials of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) in Malacañang on Tuesday.   Marcos administered the oath of office to new LCP officials led by its president, Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama. The president said infrastructure and digitalization were among the focus of his administration and LGUs could join in implementing various projects through PPPs. “There are plenty of opportunities, especially in infrastructure. We have friends from various countries — especially the ambassadors who paid us courtesy calls — they are offering us a lot of help,” he added. “There’s ODA, there’s private sector [proposals], joint venture … Well, you’re [in the] local government, you know that already. Local government generally cannot do it by itself. We have to find partners, we have to find local partners, we have to find investors. You’re used to that,” he told mayors. A PPP is a long-term arrangement between a government unit and private companies. It usually involves using private capital to finance government projects such as toll roads, hospitals, and airports, and then allowing the private financiers to collect fees from taxpayers or users over the duration of the PPP contract. Aside from helping cash-strapped governments build much-needed public infrastructure at no money outlay on their part, this can help LGUs by tapping private sector expertise in undertaking big projects. Starting this year, LGUs will be handling big-ticket programs and projects previously carried out by the national government. This followed the decision of the Supreme Court in 2018 granting the petitions of Batangas Gov. Hermilando Mandanas and the late former Bataan Gov. Enrique Garcia Jr. that the LGUs’ internal revenue allotment or IRA (which is now called the national tax allotment or NTA) should come from 40 percent of “all” national taxes—not only from the Bureau of Internal Revenue as was done in the past but also from the Bureau of Customs’ collections of import duties and other taxes. The result is that for 2022, LGUs will be getting a record P1.08 trillion of the national budget through their NTA, according to earlier estimates by the Department of Budget and Management. In 2021, this amounted to only P695.49 billion.   Faced with a smaller share of the overall tax revenues, then President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 138 in early June 2021 stipulating that the national government will “devolve” or transfer to LGUs the implementation of formerly national government functions. It cited Section 17 of the Local Government Code of 1991 allowing the transfer to LGUs of local infrastructure (for education, irrigation, and trade), agriculture and natural resource management, environmental services, telecommunications, peace and order, social welfare, transportation, tourism, and housing services functions. In his meeting with the LCP officers, however, the president said he has formed a team headed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to look into issues of devolution and decentralization arising from the implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling. Marcos recalled that he already had “extensive discussions” with Mandanas and the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo on the devolution issue when he was chair of the Senate committee on local government. Contentious functions The original concept, he said, was to use the IRA for the fourth, fifth, and sixth class provinces or LGUs and provide assistance to provinces that operated hospitals but didn’t have the funds. The remainder of the IRA would be given according to the provisions of the Local Government Code that varies depending on the LGUs, he said. However, there were difficulties in applying the ruling to some cities, and the decision-making on fund appropriation was left to the discretion of local executives, according to the president. “But we are still continuing to look at it. What I [want to know] is: What really belongs to local government and what does not belong to local government?” he said. “Also, some [functions] have been given to local governments, sometimes it can’t be done because we don’t have a new item [in the budget], we don’t have new funds, and we don’t have training for whatever [purpose] it is for,” he said. He said one example was the land use plan, wherein several LGUs faced difficulty in implementation because of the lack of money and qualified personnel, adding that this work could be given to the national government.  Even the repair of school buildings was a contentious issue, Marcos said, because it was not clear if the national or the local government should be responsible. The president suggested that the national government could provide additional allocation to the LGUs mandated by law to conduct school building repairs. He said the Department of Education did not have enough budget for school repairs, but that he proposed to Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte to just give materials, funds, or other forms of assistance to the LGUs.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"All 24 senators would be facing off with representatives of the executive department in upcoming meetings of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (Ledac) in order to prevent a repeat of the successive vetoes of five major bills that were products of hard legislative work, according to Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva. Villanueva told reporters on Tuesday that the senators were invited to attend the Ledac and would be asked to present their priority measures for consideration by Malacañang and to synchronize these with the 19-point agenda of the executive department.   “We were told that in the coming week or two, we will be having the Ledac. This is a welcome development considering that a high number of the measures we passed have been vetoed,” he said. Villanueva said Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri proposed the full Senate attendance at Ledac meetings after a “long discussion” with Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez and the “core group” of the Marcos Cabinet. “This is not only because of the series of veto messages, but primarily, it’s natural that we do this after the [State of the Nation Address of the president]. But we don’t want a repeat of what happened before,” he said referring to the five bills that were passed in the 18th Congress but were struck down by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.. All the bills went through deliberations in bicameral conference committees, Villanueva said. Marcos vetoed the bill to create the Bulacan Airport City Special Ecozone with tax privileges; the measure expanding the franchise area of the Aboitiz-owned Davao Light and Power Co.; and the bill to “strengthen” the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, which gave financial perks to officers of state-owned companies. On Friday, the president vetoed two more bills — one granting tax exemption to the honorarium and allowances for government workers performing poll duties and the bill creating the proposed Philippine Transport Safety Board. Hard to swallow Marcos vetoed four of the five bills on grounds that they either reduced revenue or created unnecessary government spending. “That is not very easy to swallow, because you work really hard for a specific measure, and (the legislative process) takes so much time and government resources,” he said. Of 12 major bills passed by the previous Congress, five were rejected by the President and seven he allowed to lapse into law, including one that lowers the age for vape users.   At the Ledac, lawmakers will deliberate on the 19-point legislative agenda of the Marcos administration that is expected to be put forward by the executive department, and determine which of these will be their priority, Villanueva said. The Ledac, which was created by law in 1992 under the late President Fidel Ramos, serves as a “consultative and advisory body to the President,” who chairs the National Economic and Development Authority Board, on certain programs and policies essential to reaching the country’s economic goals. Who will head PLLO? It also serves as a “venue to facilitate high-level policy discussions on vital issues and concerns affecting national development.” Villanueva observed that it was taking Malacañang a long time to appoint the head of the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office (PLLO) with the Ledac expected to happen in a week or two. The PLLO promotes “presidential legislative initiatives and other administration-sponsored priority policy reforms and development programs,” according to its website. It conducts a “strategic information dissemination campaign” and a “sustained day-to-day collaboration” with the Senate and the House of Representatives, and with other “interest groups.” “I was surprised to learn that it was not yet made official, because yesterday at the senators’ caucus, we already talked about it,” Villanueva said, referring to the reported selection of former Batangas Rep. and House Secretary General Mark Llandro Mendoza as PLLO chief.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Former President Rodrigo Duterte already has a plan to block any attempt by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to arrest him, even before the government has responded to a proposed resumption of the investigation of the charges of crimes against humanity against him by the tribunal prosecutor, his former spokesperson said on Tuesday. Harry Roque, who disclosed on Tuesday that he was now counsel to Duterte in the ICC case, said that the ex-president would “never” cooperate with “foreign courts” in trying him for any crime.   “He also said — and actually this idea came from him — that if, for any reason, the ICC will continue to exercise its jurisdiction, he will go before Philippine courts for a restraining order to restrain the Philippine police from serving the warrant of arrest against him,” Roque said in an interview with ANC. Duterte will argue that Philippine courts are “able and willing” to prosecute cases against him and there was no basis for “foreign institutions” to interfere with the country’s judicial system, he said. Option for victims’ kin International law professor Romel Bagares said families of the victims of the bloody drug war had a legal remedy against such a move by Duterte, who has returned to Davao City where he served two decades as mayor before he was elected president in 2016. “Supposing Mr. Duterte secures a TRO [temporary restraining order] from a Davao regional trial court, other parties — like the victims or any other interested parties — can then appeal before the Supreme Court,” he said. Bagares acknowledged that the decision of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. not to rejoin the ICC would make it difficult for the court to proceed to trial. Even if the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC) issues warrants against Duterte, “who would enforce the arrest warrants without the Philippine government’s cooperation?” he asked. “The summonses are of no effect if the suspects also do not recognize the ICC procedures,” he said. But Bagares noted that the ICC had proven that it was still able to arrest suspects with the help of “international instruments.” Marcos position Marcos said on Monday the Philippines would not rejoin the ICC because local investigators were already doing a probe of the drug war, so there was no need for the ICC to do that.   Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in March 2018 after its prosecutor then, Fatou Bensouda, opened a preliminary examination of the charges against him and several other officials of his administration, including then national police chief Ronald dela Rosa, who is now a senator. Roque said people who have “gripes” against Duterte “should file complaints before a Philippine court and if there is probable cause he is willing to face them, but before a Philippine court.” In June, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan proposed to resume the investigation of the thousands of brutal drug war killings after it was suspended late last year upon the request of the former administration. The ICC PTC requested the government and the complainants who filed the charges against the former president to comment on Khan’s proposal by Sept. 8. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the Department of Justice (DOJ) was willing to provide the ICC with a report of its investigation of abuses in the conduct of the drug war started by his predecessor, Menardo Guevarra, who is now the solicitor general. “We will furnish them the available information as a matter of comity,” Remulla told reporters on Tuesday. He was in favor Guevarra said the government’s legal team had arrived at “a general consensus on how to handle the ICC case,” but the Office of the President, DOJ, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel were still studying “the mechanics for implementing their agreed course of action.” On Aug. 23, 2011, then-Senator Marcos and 16 of his colleagues voted in favor of Senate Resolution No. 546 to ratify the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, in support of then President Benigno Aquino III’s decision for the Philippines to join the ICC. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Ruben Carranza, who had served as a member of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, noted that Marcos was reversing course. “The same one who won’t rejoin the ICC voted to join the ICC in 2011 because (its) ‘ratification signifies Philippine commitment to human rights and is our contribution to an effective international criminal justice system,’” Carranza said, quoting a part of the Senate resolution.  Seven of the 17 senators who approved the resolution are still serving in the chamber: Loren Legarda, Francis Escudero, Lito Lapid, Ramon Revilla Jr., Jinggoy Estrada, Pia Cayetano and Alan Peter Cayetano. Dela Rosa: ‘I’m happy’ Dela Rosa, who led the brutal war on drugs, was grateful for the decision not to rejoin the ICC. “I must admit it, being the ‘No. 2 accused,’ I am happy,” Dela Rosa told reporters. Then Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, who is now the President’s chief legal counsel, was the only senator who voted against the resolution. The 98-year-old said joining the ICC might hamper soldiers in carrying out their duties and might also “expose Philippine presidents to all kinds of suits where they will have to spend their own money, personal fortunes to defend themselves and the worries that accompany them while they await the verdict, which is outside our normal forum.” Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva said he disagreed with Mr. Marcos and said “it would be better” that the senators speak with the President “to share our sentiments.” Roque said Duterte was confident that Mr. Marcos “will do everything” to prove to the ICC that it should not exercise jurisdiction over the former president. Roque was one of the founding members and former chair of the Center for International Law, an organization of lawyers that pushed the Philippines to ratify the Rome Statute.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Risa Hontiveros is pushing for the expansion of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation’s (PhilHealth) dialysis coverage to 156 sessions. Recently, PhilHealth increased the dialysis coverage of each patient from 90 to 144 sessions until the end of the year. Each patient needs 156 sessions per year of treatment.  While Hontiveros commended the coverage expansion, she wants to make the free sessions permanent. “Malaking pasasalamat sa PhilHealth sa pagtugon sa panawagan nating ipagpatuloy ang coverage ng 144 dialysis session ngayong taon. Malaking tulong ito sa ating mga kababayan,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. (A big thanks to PhilHealth for heeding our appeal to cover 144 dialysis sessions this year. This is a big help to our fellow Filipinos.) “Patuloy nating ipapanawagan na gawin itong permanente at palawigin pa hanggang 156 session kada taon,” she added. (We will continue to plead to make it permanent and further expand it to 156 sessions per year.) Hontiveros also prodded to avoid making the matter an “annual back-and-forth exercise” between the state insurer and dialysis patients. The senator noted that dialysis is still “one of the most emotionally and financially taxing causes of mortality among Filipinos.” One of Hontiveros’ priority bills in the 19th Congress is the Free Dialysis for Senior Citizens Act of 2022.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Former President Rodrigo Duterte has brought up the possibility of seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing his arrest should the investigation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) continue, his former spokesperson Harry Roque disclosed Tuesday. Roque said this after Duterte met with some of his former Cabinet members on Monday night specifically to discuss the ICC, which is investigating the alleged crimes against humanity committed by the former president in relation to his campaign against illegal drugs.   “He also said, and actually this idea came from him… that if, for any reason, the ICC will continue to exercise its jurisdiction, he will go before Philippine courts for a restraining order to restrain the Philippine police from serving the warrant of arrest against him,” Roque said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel. “He will argue that the Philippine courts are able and willing to prosecute these cases and therefore, there is no basis for foreign institutions to interfere and this is a consequence of being a sovereign country,” the former spokesperson added. In the same interview, Roque said Duterte is willing to face charges against him—but only in local courts and not foreign courts such as the ICC. “Under no circumstance will he allow any foreign prosecutor and foreign judge and foreign court to exercise jurisdiction over him and this is consistent with the principle of complementarity,” Roque said. Duterte ordered the country’s withdrawal from the Rome Statute in March 2018, a month after ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced that a preliminary examination was underway into the thousands of deaths in the Philippine government’s war-on-drugs campaign. The withdrawal took effect a year later.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Speaking a foreign language is not the sole measure of intellect, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said Tuesday as the country celebrates the National Language Month or “Buwan ng Wika” this month. “Inaasahan ang bawat isa na makilahok sa intelektuwalisasyon ng Filipino, nang sa gayon ay mabago na sa ating kamalayan na ang pagsasalita ng banyagang wika ay hindi ang natatanging pamantayan ng karunungan,” Marcos said in a statement.   (Each one is encouraged to join in intellectualizing the Filipino so that we can change our mindset and see that speaking in foreign language is not the sole measure of intelligence.) “Tiyak na sasagana, sisigla, at liliwanag ang ating kinabukasan kung itataguyod natin nang buong dangal at pagmamahal ang ating wikang pambansa,” the President added. (Our future will be brighter if we will push with pride our national language.) Marcos reminded the public that the Filipino language is not limited to Tagalog, but rather a collection of different dialects in the entire country. “Ngayon, higit kailanman, panatilihin nating matatag ang ating lingwistikong pundasyon sa Filipino, dahil ang sarili nating wika ang ating magiging batayang lakas sa paglinang sa ating kultura habang nakikiayon sa agos ng makabagong panahon,” Marcos said. (Now more than ever, we need to keep our linguistic foundation strong because it is our own language that will be a measure of developing our culture while we go with the changing times.) “Isaisip at isapuso natin na tayo lamang ang makapagpapatibay ng wikang taal sa ating pagkakakilanlan,” he added. (Put in our minds and hearts that it is only us who can strengthen our language that is essential in our identity.) The National Language Month, or “Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa” is celebrated in August pursuant to Proclamation No. 1041 signed by former President Fidel V. Ramos on July 15, 1997.   The celebration coincides with the birth month of the late President Manuel L. Quezon, known as the father of the Philippine national language, who was born on August 19, 1878.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday said the Philippines would not rejoin the International Criminal Court (ICC), noting that the government was already investigating alleged crimes in the previous administration’s bloody campaign against illegal drugs. “No, the Philippines has no intention of rejoining the ICC,” the president said in a brief interview with reporters on the sidelines of his visit to the Pasig City Sports Complex vaccination site.   “We’re saying that there is already an investigation going on here and it’s continuing, so why would there be one like that [in the ICC]?” he pointed out. He said the government was already crafting the proper response to the tribunal’s invitation to submit “observations” as The Hague-based court seeks to resume its investigation of alleged abuses during the Duterte administration’s crackdown on illegal drugs. In an order dated July 14, the ICC said the country has until Sept. 8, 2022, to provide any observations on the ICC prosecutor’s request to reopen its probe. Marcos confirmed the meeting he had on July 27 with Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile and private lawyer Harry Roque to begin discussing the administration’s strategy in dealing with the ICC. The president said Roque was consulted because “he is involved and recognized by the ICC.” An expert in public international law and human rights, Roque is among the lawyers — the only Filipino — accredited to practice before the ICC. “So anyway, [the meeting was held] so we will know what we will do, if we will respond, if we will not respond. And if we will respond, what will our response be. Or it’s also possible that we will ignore them because we are not under them anymore,” he said. The president said the ICC was “a very different kind of a court” so the government’s legal team would “study” the correct response to the ICC probe resumption. “I told them to study well the procedure so that we’ll be able to do the correct thing. Because we do not want, of course, that they might misinterpret our actions. That’s why we should be clear about what we have to do, who will write who, what will be in the letter (among others),” he said. Last January, then-presidential aspirant Marcos said he would not allow ICC prosecutors to come and investigate accusations of crimes against humanity.   “We have a functioning judiciary, and that’s why I don’t see the need for a foreigner to come and do the job for us. Our judicial system is perfectly capable of doing that,” he said then. Regrettable decision The Philippines, a state party to the Rome Statute since Nov. 1, 2011, formally notified the body of its withdrawal from the statute on March 17, 2018. The withdrawal took effect only a year after, or on March 17, 2019. However, the ICC retained jurisdiction with respect to alleged crimes that occurred in the Philippines while it was a State Party, or from Nov. 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019. In March 2018, then-President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the withdrawal of the country’s ratification of the Rome Statute, the treaty which created the ICC, just weeks after former ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced a preliminary examination was underway into the deaths of thousands due to his administration’s illegal drugs crackdown. Opposition leaders earlier asked Marcos to rejoin the ICC to boost safeguards against human rights abuses. On Monday, Sen. Risa Hontiveros said Marcos’ decision for the Philippines to stay out of the ICC was “regrettable,” insisting that those being investigated by the international body should not be afraid if they “have nothing to hide.” “It is the prerogative of the President, though it is regrettable as the Rome Statute is the collective commitment of the community of nations against state-sponsored impunity,” Hontiveros said in a statement. “I hope he will not undermine or block [the] investigation of acts or violations that took place before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC,” she said. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said he did not agree with Marcos’ move, but he acknowledged that the chief executive was the “decision-maker on if and/or when to join an international organization or treaty.” Probe resumption Lawyers representing the drug war victims said they remained undaunted by the president’s decision not to rejoin the ICC, expressing confidence that the probe would still continue.  Edre Olalia, president of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, said Marcos’ decision “would not fatally affect the resumption of the investigation even as it would not be a walk in the park.” “The ICC has the means, experience, resources and creativity to deal with situations such as noncooperation by states,” Olalia said. Experts in international law and even the ICC itself believed that withdrawal from the statute would not affect ongoing proceedings, including the current investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity committed during Duterte’s six-year war on drugs. This follows Article 127 of the Rome Statute, which states that criminal investigations and proceedings that started before withdrawals took effect will continue. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, recently asked the court to reopen a probe into the drug war, which was deferred last year upon the request of the Philippine government, after finding that the country did not conduct any genuine investigation into the crimes being investigated by the high tribunal. Lawyer Kristina Conti, co-counsel for the victims, called Marcos’ decision “a terrible mistake, and could prove to be a costly miscalculation not to rejoin the ICC.” “Should [the president] choose not to cooperate with the international court’s investigation supported and called for by many Filipinos, he will contend with a political storm with international impact,” she added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"While saying it is “unfortunate” that the first case of monkeypox was recorded in the country, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. claimed Monday that monkeypox is not as scary as COVID-19. Marcos made the remark as he visited a COVID-19 vaccination site in Pasig City. “It’s unfortunate that we have recorded our monkeypox case. Let me stress on that, it is one monkeypox case in the Philippines… ‘yung pasyente nung monkeypox ay pagaling na [the monkeypox patient is now on the road to recovery] ,” Marcos said in a press briefing at the vaccination site. “Even then, I want to be very clear to everyone: This is not COVID. Hindi kagaya ng COVID ito. Hindi nakakatakot kagaya ng COVID ‘yung monkeypox. Parang smallpox, marami namang gamot. Pwede nating gamutin [Monkeypox is not as scary as COVID. It’s like smallpox, there are lots of medicines. We can use them],” the President added. Nonetheless, Marcos said the public must maintain good hygiene and sanitation like fighting any other disease. The President added that the government is monitoring the situation. “Sa ngayon, yung monkeypox ay talagang nakabantay tayo. Nasanay na tayo rito sa COVID-19. Nakabantay tayo ng husto,” Marcos said. (Right now, we are strictly monitoring monkeypox. We got used to COVID-19. We are diligently monitoring it.) The Department of Health (DOH) earlier announced the first case of monkeypox in the country—a 31-year-old Filipino national who arrived from abroad last July 19 and had prior travel to countries with documented monkeypox cases. The DOH said the patient is “recovering well at home.”  The World Health Organization earlier said the rapidly spreading monkeypox outbreak is a “public health emergency of international concern” – designed to signal that a coordinated international response is needed and could unlock funding and global efforts to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments.  The DOH has said monkeypox is a “rarely fatal” disease with mild symptoms.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"To avoid another incident of a “bill-vetoing spree” of Malacañang,” Senator Chiz Escudero on Monday urged the President to immediately appoint a “high-caliber Cabinet member” as head of the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office (PLLO). Escudero made the call following Marcos’ veto of five measures approved by the previous Congress, including the tax exemption of the honoraria for teachers doing poll duties.   PLLO’s next chief must work with Congress to ensure “veto-proof” legislation is passed, according to the senator. He or she must also have “the policy grasp and the political gravitas in helping craft laws that fuse the best ideas from the legislative and executive branches,” Escudero said. “The presidential point person in Congress must wade into policy work and must know what provisions in a bill being discussed might run into opposition later in the executive circles,” he went on. If the PLLO will merely report the ongoings in both chambers of Congress, Escudero said, “then that person is no better than a CCTV.” “Kung Marites lang siya, manood na lang siya ng YouTube [If he’s nosy enough, just watch YouTube] because plenary and committee hearings are livestreamed there,” he  also said. The senator said that appointing a PLLO head will ensure a harmonious working relationship between the executive and legislative branches, as well as ensure that “months, man hours, and millions” spent crafting a bill will not be thrown away because a PLLO was “ineffective and inefficient.” And while pushing for Malacañang’s advocacy in Congress,  Escudero said the PLLO must also persuade the Palace to see the merits of congressional counterproposals. “Therefore, the chief PLLO must have the political savvy to build a sturdy two-way bridge that will facilitate the traffic of best ideas from both sides,” he said. “Kung mali ang posisyon ng isang Cabinet secretary or sablay ang provision ng isang bill, ang trabaho niya ay hindi kunsintihin ito pero i-wasto.”   (If a Cabinet secretary gets a wrong position or a certain bill is defective, the work of a PLLO is to correct it and not to put consent.) “Doing so will protect the President. Lawmaking is a series of compromises and reconciliations. The process has many points in which the PLLO can make suggestions,” the senator said. Escudero said the appointment of a PLLO head must pave the way for the convening of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council to discuss the administration’s priority bills and come up with a common legislative agenda.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the so-called supermajority in the Senate on Sunday urged Malacañang to immediately convene the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (Ledac), noting that while the veto power is a right of the president, its frequent exercise could strain relations between the executive and legislative branches of government. The suggestion followed Marcos’ decision to veto five measures approved by the previous Congress, including the tax exemption of the honoraria for teachers doing poll duties.   “We acknowledge that the veto power is a prerogative of the president, but it puts an unnecessary strain on the relationship between legislators and the executive,” Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri told the Inquirer. “This should be avoided,” he pointed out. “We respect the prerogative of the president, but we also stand firm with conviction that we did our job,” Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva said. Zubiri said he had already communicated with Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez and Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo Jr. regarding the need to hold a Ledac meeting as soon as possible. Proactive liaison The Senate leaders added that designating a proactive head of the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office (PLLO) would help the chief executive put into action the 19-point legislative agenda that he mentioned during his State of the Nation Address last week. Villanueva underscored the critical role of the PLLO and Ledac in ensuring that the legislative work of Congress would be aligned with the Marcos administration’s priority measures. For Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara, Senate finance committee chair, activating the Ledac would result in a “more harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive.” “We need a proactive PLLO [secretary] who has the trust of both Malacañang and the two houses of Congress,” Angara said. “I think the sooner the Ledac meets, the better,” added administration Sen. JV Ejercito.   The Senate President said he had also raised the importance of having a “good PLLO secretary who can easily communicate with both branches of government for a harmonious discussion and passage of bills.” “Thankfully both (Rodriguez and Lagdameo) agreed to arrange [a] Ledac [meeting] soon and they have a shortlist for a PLLO secretary,” he said. According to Zubiri, former Batangas representative and House secretary general Mark Llandro Mendoza emerged as the “favorite” nominee to lead the PLLO. “Mendoza is a good choice as he has been a former legislator and is well known among the incumbent senators and members of Congress,” he said. “With these two developments, I’m confident that the veto of future bills will be avoided,” he added. 5 vetoes so far In his first 30 days in office, Mr. Marcos had already vetoed five measures approved by the previous 18th Congress. The first was a bill that would have created the Bulacan Airport City Special Ecozone, which the President said would “significantly narrow our tax base” as it would provide special tax privileges to the proposed special economic zone. He also rejected the measure expanding the franchise area of Aboitiz-owned Davao Light and Power Co., and another that sought to strengthen the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel. Besides turning down the tax break for poll workers, the Chief Executive also blocked the creation of the Philippine Transportation Safety Board, a move that Sen. Grace Poe also described as “unfortunate.” Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said that while he understood the reasons that Mr. Marcos cited in thumbing down some of the measures, it was “unfortunate” that he chose to veto the bill that would have granted tax exemptions to election workers, many of them public school teachers.  Matched agenda Pimentel explained that the tax break was actually intended as an incentive for members of the electoral boards for rendering services despite the dangers they face as election workers. Established through Republic Act No. 7640, the 20-member Ledac was created in 1992 as a consultative and advisory body to the President—who also heads it—to discuss programs and harmonize the government’s national development plan with the legislative agenda of Congress. The PLLO was created under Memorandum Order No. 128 dated Nov. 11, 1987, during the term of President Corazon C. Aquino. Under the administration of former President Fidel V. Ramos, the PLLO was strengthened, making it the agency under the Office of the President that will liaise with Congress regarding all matters impinging on executive-legislative relations. It was also tasked to officially orchestrate the formulation and the shepherding of the President’s legislative agenda and all other concerns of the executive department having to do with the legislature.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has vetoed a bill granting tax exemptions to the honoraria, allowances, and other benefits given to election workers, most of them public school teachers, Malacañang announced on Saturday. While the intent of the reconciled Senate Bill No. 2520 and House Bill No. 9652 was laudable, the president said in his veto message to Congress on Friday that it would be “inequitable to other persons performing similar activities or services.”   He said the proposed law would counter the objective of the government’s Comprehensive Tax Reform Program “to correct the inequity in the country’s tax system and negate the progressivity of the reforms introduced” by Republic Act No. 10963, or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law. “Moreover, the studies of pertinent government agencies on the revenue loss is too substantial an impact to be foregone,” Marcos said. 5 vetoes in 1st month For this year’s elections on May 9, the honoraria and allowances of those who served were to be subjected to a 20-percent withholding tax. Marcos has so far vetoed five bills in his first month in office, four of them he justified by citing either potential revenue losses or unnecessary government expenses. On his first day in office, Marcos vetoed the bill creating the Bulacan Airport City Special Ecozone, pointing out that granting tax perks to a proposed special economic zone would “significantly narrow our tax base” which was not “aligned with the government’s objective to develop a tax system with a broad base and low rates.” The president later vetoed the bill on strengthening the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel because of “overbearing” provisions, particularly the excessive grant of remuneration, incentives, benefits, and allowances and honoraria “that violates the principles of equity and standardization.” No to PTSB as well The proposed measure would have given the government corporate counsel the same salary as that of his boss, the secretary of justice, Marcos said. He vetoed the bill on the tax exemptions for election workers along with the bill creating the Philippine Transportation Safety Board (PTSB). Marcos said that the PTSB’s purpose of conducting an impartial and thorough investigation of transportation accidents was already being undertaken by various agencies under the Department of Transportation, the Philippine National Police, and the National Bureau of Investigation.   His veto message also on Friday said that one of the primary policies and priorities of his administration was to “enhance the government’s institutional capacity through optimal and efficient use of resources and strategic rationalization of the functions of government.” According to Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, coauthor of the Senate bill, about 647,812 Department of Education (DepEd) personnel rendered service for this year’s national elections, 319,317 of them as members of electoral boards (EBs). Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, one of the principal authors of the House tax relief bill, said the exemption would only cost the government an annualized revenue loss of P138.6 million, which was “very reasonable given the job well done.” But the president said that providing additional support to any sector was best addressed through “targeted budgetary spending rather than the tax system.” The other principal author of the House bill, Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro lambasted the president’s veto. ‘Slap in face of teacher’ “The veto of this measure is a slap in the face of every teacher across the country who served the past elections dutifully despite long hours and higher risks of getting COVID-19,” Castro said in a statement. “With the additional risks and longer hours of poll service that they had to endure, removing the 20-percent tax on their honoraria and allowances is only just,” she added. According to the lawmaker, imposing taxes on the honoraria and allowances of poll workers “destroys the spirit and intent” of the Election Service Reform Act, or Republic Act No. 10756, to compensate for the hardships of persons rendering election service. In the recent polls, around 1,000 police officers also served as special board of election inspectors (SBEIs) in Cotabato City and some parts of Maguindanao after teachers who were supposed to perform the job backed out due to threats to their lives. Under Comelec Resolution No. 10727 on Nov. 10, 2021, teachers who render election-related services are entitled to the following honoraria: P7,000 for EB chairs; and P6,000 for EB members. A DepEd supervisor will get P5,000 and the support staff and medical personnel will receive P3,000.  They also get a travel allowance of P2,000, a communication allowance of P1,500, an “anti-COVID-19 allowance” of P500, and a minimum service credit of five days. Poll workers are also entitled to death benefits amounting to P500,000, plus P200,000 for medical assistance if they suffer election-related injuries or illnesses. Police officers serving in SBEIs have the same benefits but do not get service credits. All poll workers who extended their work hours due to vote-counting machine and other technical problems receive an additional P2,000. Koko sees contradiction Opposition Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said the President’s veto message seemed to contradict his administration’s “thrust and commitment” to national recovery. He said Congress wanted to give incentives to electoral board members by paying them “good rates” and exempting the income from taxes. Pimentel was dismayed that Marcos overlooked the “difficult and dangerous” tasks that teachers and others in government perform during elections. On the veto of the PTSB bill, Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate committee on public services, disputed the grounds cited by Marcos. She said it was “unfortunate” and lamented that the government’s fiscal position seemed to outweigh the loss of lives in transport accidents, which the measure sought to mitigate. Poe said 483 maritime accidents occurred from 2016 to 2020 and 12,487 average deaths on the road occurred yearly during the same period.  The senator contradicted the President’s view that the PTSB would duplicate the functions and mandates of existing agencies, saying that an independent body to investigate transport accidents was a global standard. “Having a (PTSB) will contribute to strengthening our transportation structure to improve mobility, put people back to work and spur the economy,” Poe said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Plea bargaining in illegal drug cases is a matter addressed entirely by the sound discretion of the court, the Supreme Court said, as it issued clarificatory guidelines to resolve questions on a Department of Justice (DOJ) circular on the same issue. “As a rule, plea bargaining requires the mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court. Regardless of the mutual agreement of the parties, the acceptance of the offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the court,” a statement from the Supreme Court Public Information Office (PIO) said.   “Though the prosecution and the defense may agree to enter into a plea bargain, it does not follow that the courts will automatically approve the proposal. Judges must still exercise sound discretion in granting or denying plea bargaining, taking into account the relevant circumstances, including the character of the accused,” it added. Plea bargaining allows the accused and the prosecution in a criminal case to work on a mutually satisfactory disposition of the case, where the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for a lighter sentence. The Supreme Court, in an en banc session, issued the guidelines to address the conflict between the DOJ Circular No. 27, which prohibits plea bargaining for illegal sale of dangerous drugs to the lesser offense of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia under Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and the high court’s resolution adopting the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drug Cases. “Holding that plea bargaining in the prosecution of drug cases goes into the very matters of fundamental constitutional rights, the Court resolved to clarify the guidelines it earlier issued,” the Supreme Court PIO said. “While the Supreme Court takes judicial notice of the DOJ’s efforts to amend DOJ Circular No. 27 to conform with the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the Court nevertheless issues the following guidelines for the guidance of both the Bench and the Bar,” it added. Parts of the guidelines include:   Offers for plea bargaining must be initiated in writing by way of a formal written motion filed by the accused in court;   The lesser offense which the accused proposes to plead guilty to must necessarily be included in the offense charged;   Upon receipt of the proposal for plea bargaining that is compliant with the provisions of the Court’s Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases, the judge shall order that a drug dependency assessment be administered. If the accused admits drug use, or denies it but is found positive after a drug dependency test, then he/she shall undergo treatment and rehabilitation for a period of not less than six months. Said period shall be credited to his/her penalty and the period of his/her after-care and follow-up program if the penalty is still unserved. If the accused is found negative for drug use/dependency, then he/she will be released on time served, otherwise, he/she will serve his/her sentence in jail minus the counseling period at the rehabilitation center. The court shall not allow plea bargaining if the objection to the plea bargaining is valid and supported by evidence to the effect that: (a) the offender is a recidivist, habitual offender, known in the community as a drug addict and a troublemaker, has undergone rehabilitation but had a relapse, or has been charged many times; or (b) when the evidence of guilt is strong.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is set to submit the proposed national budget for 2023 on August 22, the Palace announced Friday. Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles disclosed this following a special Cabinet meeting led by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. specifically to tackle next year’s national budget.   Initially, Cruz-Angeles disclosed that the DBM will submit the proposed budget next week. Following the press briefing, however, Cruz-Angeles clarified that the DBM will submit the proposed national budget to Congress on August 22. ‘Following the special Cabinet Meeting held earlier today, the DBM shall undertake the printing of the Budget Documents, which includes the printing of the National Expenditure Program (NEP), Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing, Staffing Summary, and the President’s Budget Message,” Cruz-Angeles said in a statement. “DBM is scheduled to submit the Budget Documents to the President on 19 August 2022, not next week as mentioned earlier in the press briefing, and the same is expected to be submitted to Congress on August 22, 2022,” she added. During the meeting, Cruz-Angeles said the DBM presented the proposed national budget for next year before the Cabinet. There were inputs from the different Cabinet secretaries for fine-tuning of the budget, she added. Cruz-Angeles earlier said the 2023 national budget seeks the “promotion of broad-based and inclusive economic recovery and growth.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"It is “greatly disappointing” that President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. made no mention of the current state of the country’s justice system in his State of the Nation Address (Sona). This was according to Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, who said Friday the President’s first Sona was “safe.”   “I don’t recall even the President talking about the justice system. Para sa akin (For me), the matter of human rights is a part of the justice system,” Pimentel said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel. “So that is greatly disappointing that [there was] no mention about the current state of our justice system, the speed at which our courts are disposing of the disputes before them,” he added. Pimentel also pointed out how there was no mention of the war on drugs. For the Senate leader, this indicated that the President would not prioritize this and would focus on the agriculture sector. “‘Yung sa drug war, kung hindi na-mention ‘yun, talaga namang hindi na-mention. That means na hindi na yun nya priority,” Pimentel said. (When it comes to the drug war, it was not mentioned. That means it is not his priority.) “Law enforcement will still be there dealing in drugs will still be a crime, it should still be prosecuted and the drug prevalence should be brought down, but ang priority ni (the priority of) President Marcos, and this is loud and clear, is agriculture,” he added. ‘Safe’ Sona When it comes to the overall Sona, Pimentel believes Marcos chose to take a “safe” route. “It was a safe Sona. When he got to the end of the Sona and he was enumerating his legislative priorities and I was taking down notes, while taking down notes, I said to myself, ‘I have heard all of these before’,” Pimentel said. “Sabi ko (I said), I think the President chose to be safe this time. No truly bold ideas which I find surprising given his mandate,” he added.   In terms of Marcos’ priority legislation, he called on Congress to pass it during his Sona. Pimentel said he would support the push to amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act or the Epira law.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla described as “improbable” and “ridiculous” the multibillion-peso estate taxes being charged against the family of President Marcos. The Marcos estate tax liability has allegedly ballooned to P203 billion from the P23 billion originally assessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in 1991, nearly two years after the death of former President Ferdinand Marcos in Hawaii.   “If I look at the figures, they seem improbable. The figures were computed based on a biased computation,” Remulla told Rotary Club of Manila members on Thursday. He argued that the late dictator’s family was charged estate taxes for assets that were not in their possession at the time of his death in September 1989. Deceased President Corazon Aquino created the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) upon assuming office in 1986 to sequester ill-gotten assets of the Marcoses and their cronies. Mandate shift for PCGG “I think that’s what happened in this case: Assets that were never passed on to the heirs were being taxed a charge of estate tax. So from the very beginning, I think the premises were ridiculous,” Remulla said. “I can be proven wrong … but that is what I surmise. That is what I understand from what I’ve read before, that these assets never passed on to them but they’re being charged taxes on these assets which are not theirs anymore or which were never theirs because the government got them already,” he continued. Remulla also disclosed plans to shift the mandate of the PCGG, an agency attached to the Department of Justice (DOJ), to become a “central forfeiture asset office” not only for Marcos ill-gotten assets but all assets seized by the government. “We don’t really want to abolish the PCGG. I have suggested that we create an asset forfeiture office for assets seized by the government for nonpayment of taxes, drug trafficking or for other crimes” include graft and corruption, he said. Remulla said he suggested the change to Mr. Marcos. “When we were looking at the future of the PCGG, how it’s been 36 years after the fact, I don’t think we need to spend the next hundred years running after the Marcoses,” said the former Cavite district representative.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos has extended the terms of the current officers in charge (OICs) of government agencies and departments until Dec. 31 or until a replacement has been appointed. By presidential authority, Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez issued a directive through Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 3 allowing OICs to stay for about five more months “to ensure the continuous and effective delivery of government services.”   Signed on July 27, the memo amended and supplemented MC No. 1, which initially extended the tenure of OICs only up to July 31. The new directive will also prolong the tenure of all contractual and casual employees from their positions until the end of the year. “All OICs of departments, agencies, bureau and office, noncareer executive service (CES) officials occupying CES positions and contractual or casual employees covered herein shall continue to perform their duties and discharge their functions until 31 December 2022 or until a replacement has been appointed or designated, whichever comes first,” the order said. All officials and employees covered by the latest memorandum will be required to submit bimonthly performance reports to their respective heads. What they can’t do But the retained OICs, from the department level down to the sub-agencies or bureaus, may not enter into new contracts or projects or disburse extraordinary funds—except for those involved in the food, transportation, and energy sectors. Also covered by this ban on new contracts are government-owned and -controlled corporations, government instrumentalities with corporate powers, government corporate entities, and government financial institutions. The prohibition remains in effect until the appointment of new directors and the election of chief executive officers. The order also applies to free port and special economic zone administrators. Vergeire, Solidum Among the top-level OICs whose term will be extended are Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire of the Department of Health, Undersecretary Renato Solidum Jr. of the Department of Science and Technology, and Dr. Melissa Aradanas of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development. Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman earlier said the practice of hiring consultants and contractuals in government would soon end under the “rightsizing” bill to be proposed to the 19th Congress by the Marcos administration’s economic team. Pangandaman earlier estimated that removing even just 5 percent of redundant offices and positions would save the government about P14.8 billion.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Marcos has called Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile and other top administration lawyers to a meeting on the cases filed against his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte in the International Criminal Court (ICC) alleging crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, who was also at Wednesday’s meeting, told reporters on Thursday that the “only agenda was the government’s position on the ICC investigation” of the charges against the former president.   He declined to give details of their discussions, saying he’d rather leave it to Marcos to make any disclosure. The public got wind of the meeting after former Duterte spokesperson Harry Roque posted a picture of those who attended it on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. In addition to Enrile, Guevarra and Roque, the picture showed Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez, and Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo seated at a wooden table with the President at the head. ‘Fundamental interest’ Asked whether the Marcos administration was legally obliged to engage with the ICC even though the investigation concerned Duterte, Guevarra said: “The state, as distinguished from the government or its officials, whether past or present, has fundamental interest in the ICC case.” Duterte and several other members of his administration had been charged in the ICC with multiple murder as part of the allegation that they committed crimes against humanity for the thousands killed in his brutal drug war. The ICC suspended the probe last year at the request of the Philippine government. On July 14, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber requested the Philippine government and the complainants to comment on the reopening of the investigation proposed on June 24 by ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan. The ICC asked the government and the families of the drug war victims to submit their comments by Sept. 8. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a Rotary Club of Manila meeting on Thursday, Remulla insisted that the ICC had no jurisdiction over the Philippines after the country withdrew its membership from the court.   “They say that they want to investigate crimes here in the country, but we have a functioning judicial system. It’s not perfect but it’s functioning,” he said. Earlier, he said that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was busy collating data and the results of its investigation of the drug war. “If they ask for a report, we will give them a report … out of our friendship with them, out of decency,” he said. “But for us to say that we are under them I think is another matter. This has to be threshed out properly in international law.” Remulla refused to comment when asked whether rejoining the ICC was discussed during the meeting. Roque, a former human rights lawyer who ran for senator under the Marcos slate in the May 2022 elections, said he attended the “productive meeting.” “I confirm that I have been retained as private counsel of PBBM (President Bongbong Marcos) for the princely sum of 20 pesos. As such, all my conversations with the President on legal matters are covered by atty-client confidentiality,” he said in a Facebook post on Thursday. Asked what matters were discussed during the meeting, Roque told the Inquirer in a Viber message that everything was “confidential” and that he had “no authority to speak.” In a press conference on Thursday, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Ma. Tereza Daza said the DFA, as conduit of information from the ICC, was coordinating with the DOJ and Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) on the government’s next move. Daza said the government was committed to fighting impunity despite its withdrawal from the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. The Philippines withdrew from the treaty in 2018 after Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda opened a preliminary examination of the charges against Duterte. The withdrawal took effect on March 17, 2019.  “The Philippines underscores that it has the primary jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the crime against humanity allegedly being committed in the anti-illegal drugs campaign,” Daza said. “As the court of last resort, the ICC complements but does not replace the national courts. It only operates in cases where national jurisdictions are unable or unwilling to prosecute,” she added. Asked whether there were plans for the country to rejoin the ICC, Daza said this would be subjected to consultations with the DOJ and OSG, the lead agencies concerned. Rodriguez and Press Secretary Trixie Cruz Angeles did not respond to repeated requests for details and comments regarding the meeting. Roque was part of a group that strongly pushed for the ratification of the Rome Statute by the Philippines. The Senate ratified the treaty in 2011. Then Senate President Enrile was the only senator who voted against ratification.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"“The interest of consumers comes first,” Senator Grace Poe said Thursday after President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. vetoed the measure seeking to expand the franchise area of Davao Light and Power Company, Inc (DLPC).  Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, said that while she respects the President’s exercise of his veto powers, the grant of the expansion of DLPC’s franchise area “would have rolled out cheaper and better electricity services that can spur much needed growth in the region.”   “It is the people of Davao themselves who clamored for a new power provider as they have been held hostage by onerous power supply agreements entered into with less than due diligence,” Poe said in a statement.  “The interest of consumers comes first,” she added.  In his letter to Congress, Marcos said he was constrained to veto the bill “due to the apparent overlap and possible infringement into the subsisting franchise, permits, and contracts previously granted to North Davao Electric Cooperative Inc. (NORDECO).” Marcos likewise said that the resulting repeal of the North Davao Electric Cooperative Inc.’s franchise over the expanded franchise area will violate the Constitution.  However, Poe said Congress made sure in the measure that the franchise expansion would not be violative of existing laws including the Electric Power Industry Reform Act and any constitutional or case law.  “As the Constitution allows, the franchise expansion falls squarely under the ‘amendment, alteration or repeal by Congress when the common good requires’,” Poe said.  “There is also no violation of the non-impairment clause of the Constitution as this does not apply to franchises. It is settled that police power subordinates the non-impairment clause in the ‘interest of public health, safety, morals and general welfare’,” the senator added.  Poe likewise stressed that the proposed expansion of DLPC’s franchise area is “not a collateral attack” but is “actually a response to the appeal of NORDECO’s customers for better power service.” The senator said the Senate will await action from the House of Representatives as to whether the congressmen will refile the measure before the upper chamber can consider it again.    According to an Inquirer report, six local governments in Davao have signed their own resolutions calling for a new electricity provider that will replace NORDECO due to frequent brownouts, among other issues.  There were also protests, however, against the granting of the congressional franchise to DLPC  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva is seeking the immediate passage of a measure that will promote equal work opportunities for senior citizens and encourage private companies to hire the elderly. In filing Senate Bill No. 360, Villanueva noted that 3.17 million senior citizens are still “gainful workers” based on the latest available data from the Philippine Statistics Authority as of 2015.   “There is a need to provide opportunities for our senior citizens who are still able and willing to obtain gainful employment and wish to continue to become economically active and productive during their golden years,”  he said. Under his bill, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) will be mandated to provide a matching and employment facilitation services for senior citizens.   It will also raise the allowable deduction from gross income of private entities that will employ senior citizens as employees from 15 percent to 25 percent of the total amount paid as salaries and wages, as well as trainings provided to senior citizens, in accordance with Section 34 of the National Internal Revenue Code. The bill likewise removes the proviso that the annual income of the senior citizen should not exceed the latest poverty threshold. This is “to encourage employers to hire senior citizens from all walks of life, as long as they are able, willing and qualified to do the job,” Villanueva explained. Employers would also be allowed, under the bill, the flexibility to grant greater benefits or improve the working conditions and terms of employment of senior citizens beyond the minimum requirements provided under applicable laws. “Given the foregoing, this bill will redound to the benefit of millions of senior citizens who wish to remain economically active and productive,” Villanueva said. “Thus, in line with the state’s policy to take care of the interest and welfare of our senior citizens, the immediate passage of this bill is earnestly sought,” he further said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. left Metro Manila on Thursday morning to visit earthquake-hit Abra province, the Palace announced. Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said Marcos’ chopper took off for Abra past 8 a.m.   “This morning, at past 8AM, the President took off for Abra to check the situation, inspect the damage and be briefed on the rescue and relief efforts there,” Cruz-Angeles said in a statement. On Wednesday, the Palace said that Marcos will immediately visit Abra, which was the epicenter of the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit parts of the Luzon region, once an “all clear” signal is given. In the subsequent press briefing, Marcos said an immediate visit of a national official may only cause a disturbance on the local rescue and relief operations. “I am staying away from going to the affected areas for a very simple reason: It has been my experience as a governor, it has been my experience in Yolanda that when the national officers come to the affected areas, ginugulo lang namin ang trabaho ng mga local,” he said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said Wednesday he will be pushing for the passage of a bill that seeks to create the Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR). Marcos made the remark following the powerful earthquake that struck parts of Luzon, particularly the northern regions, which has so far left four persons dead.   “Yes,” Marcos said when asked during a press briefing if he would push for creating DRR. “I don’t like to say it pero mukhang mapapadalas ito eh. Not the earthquake pero ‘yung weather, lalo na ‘yung extreme weather,” he added. (I don’t want to say it, but it seems that this will happen more often. Not the earthquake but the extreme weather disturbances.)

We need more capability than we have now,” Marcos said. “Magaling na tayo sa bagyo. Marunong na tayo sa lindol.Pero ang mga dangers na — the dangers that the effects of climate change present are different, that’s why we need a specialist agency,” he added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Monday gave the Filipino people a more detailed preview of what his administration intends to accomplish in the next six years, highlighting the immediate need to resuscitate the pandemic-battered economy and to uplift the lives of marginalized farmers, debt-strapped agrarian reform beneficiaries, migrant workers and the poor. In his first State of the Nation Address (Sona) before the joint session of Congress, the President also listed 19 legislative measures that he requested lawmakers to pass in order to achieve his administration’s various socioeconomic goals.   In his speech that lasted an hour and 12 minutes which was applauded 84 times and delivered in a mix of English and Filipino, Marcos also touched on the delicate issue of the West Philippine Sea, promising that he “will not preside over any process that will abandon even a square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power.” The most applauded part of his Sona, aside from the conclusion, was his proposal to set up “specialty hospitals” in various parts of the country similar to the Philippine Heart Center, Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Children’s Medical Center and the National Kidney and Transplant Institute — projects built during his late father’s tenure — that are found in Metro Manila. The president said he knew the hardships endured by the people in the past two years and the efforts they were doing to meet the challenges of the present. “I do not intend to diminish the risks and challenges that we face in this turbulent time in global history, and yet, I see sunlight filtering through these dark clouds. We have assembled the best Filipino minds to help navigate us through this time of global crisis,” he said. “We will endure. Let our Filipino spirit ever remain undimmed. I know this in my mind, in my heart, in my very soul that the state of the nation is sound,” he added. Agrarian loan write-off The president called on Congress to pass a law condoning more than P58 billion in loans owed by some 654,000 beneficiaries of the government’s agrarian reform program. “In this [proposed] law, the loans of agrarian reform beneficiaries with unpaid amortization and interest shall be condoned. The aim of the law is to erase the loans that could not be paid by our farmers who are beneficiaries of agrarian reform,” the president said. Agrarian reform beneficiaries who are still to receive their awarded land under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program shall receive it without any obligation to pay any amortization, according to Marcos. He said the condonation of the existing agrarian reform loans would cover 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands.   While waiting for the law to be passed, the president said he intended to issue an executive order to impose a one-year moratorium on the payment of land amortization and interest payments, noting that such moratorium was provided under Republic Act No. 11469, or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. “A moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy,” he said. He said he would also enforce Executive Order No. 75, series of 2019, issued by his predecessor, requiring all government agencies, bureaus, departments, and instrumentalities to turn over agricultural lands to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries. He said there were, at present, about 52,000 ha of unused agricultural lands of the government that would be distributed to landless war veterans, surviving spouses and orphans of war veterans, and retirees of the military and the police in accordance with RA 6657. Under EO 75, agricultural lands would also be given to graduates of college degrees in agriculture who are landless. The president also promised continuing assistance to the beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), victims of calamities and the sick. 6-year fiscal plan The president presented what he called Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) of his administration which seeks “to attain short-term macro-fiscal stability while remaining supportive of the country’s economic recovery and to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability.” Marcos said he wanted Congress to adopt and concur with the MTFS by passing a concurrent resolution. Measurable medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives include 6.5-7.5 percent real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022, and 6.5-8 percent annually between 2023 to 2028; 9 percent or single-digit poverty rate by 2028; 3-percent national government deficit-to-GDP ratio by 2028; less than 60 percent national government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025, and at least $4,256 income per capita to attain upper middle-income status by 2024. Once adopted, the MTFS will become an anchor for the annual spending and financing plan of the national government and Congress when preparing the annual budget and undertaking related appropriation activities.  Renewable energy push “Our tax system will be adjusted in order to catch up with the rapid developments of the digital economy, including the imposition of value-added tax on digital service providers,” he said, adding that initial revenue impact of this would be around P11.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tax compliance procedures will be simplified to promote ease of paying taxes, he added. In the power sector, the President said the government must build new power plants and push for the use of renewable energy to lower the price of electricity in the country. “We must build new power plants. We must take advantage of all the best technology that [is] now available, especially in the areas of renewable energy,” he said, receiving applause from the audience that included members of the country’s business elite. According to him, the government must examine the entire system of transmission and distribution to lower the price of electricity to the consumer. As a solution to cut electricity rates in the Philippines, the president said the country has already begun to use wind power and was now expanding the use of solar energy, which he noted “is practical almost everywhere in the Philippines all year round.” He also assured the business community that the government would provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly in the area close to the Malampaya gas field in offshore Palawan. He also pushed for the review of the possible revival and building of nuclear power plants in the country. “We will comply of course with the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima,” he said, referring to the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan. In terms of infrastructure projects, the president said he would continue the Build, Build, Build program of the Duterte administration “but, wherever possible, be expanded.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"“I will not preside over any process that will abandon even a square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power.” Those were the words President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.  used to rouse Filipino legislators and other government leaders to their feet at the Batasang Pambansa on Monday during his first State of the Nation Address.   “With respect to our place in the community of nations, the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all. And an enemy to none,” the chief executive told a joint session of the 19th Congress. “The Philippines has always been open and welcoming to all our foreign friends and visitors. That is our world view, and that is our culture,” he told his audience, which included the diplomatic corps. “But let me be clear: We are very jealous of all that is Filipino,” he reiterated again to a standing ovation. As the recognized architect of the country’s foreign policy, the president said the Philippines “will be a good neighbor — always looking for ways to collaborate and cooperate with the end goal of mutually beneficial outcomes.” “If we agree, we will cooperate and we will work together. If we differ, let us talk some more until we develop consensus. After all, that is the Filipino way,” he said. “But we will not waver. We will stand firm in our independent foreign policy, with the national interest as our primordial guide,” he added. Marcos said strong bonds and collaboration were needed among nations, especially in times of crisis, and the partnerships and alliances will provide the stability that all nations need in the new global economy. He said the country was “grateful for the messages of support and offers of help that we have received from many of our friends in the international community … Such strong relationships can only be beneficial to all involved.” Headed for Beijing Marcos did not mention any country in his address, but his first foreign policy pronouncement after being elected president was that he would affirm the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration on the country’s maritime dispute with China.   “We have a very important ruling in our favor and we will use it to continue to assert our territorial rights. It is not a claim. It is already our territorial right,” he said in May. But he has since met with two Chinese officials — Vice President Wang Qishan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi—and has accepted the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit China. The president outlined his foreign policy shortly after Vice Adm. Alberto Carlos, the highest ranking military official who oversees security in the Kalayaan Island Group in the West Philippine Sea, met with Chinese ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian. Carlos was invited to Huang’s residence on July 21 as an alumnus of the People’s Liberation Army (Navy) Command College in Nanjing, China, where he took up the Senior Naval Command Course at Naval Command College from 2007 to 2008. Also a graduate of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1989, Carlos is the most senior Philippine military official to have studied in China. “Having been accorded the privilege to study and interact with my contemporaries in the US and China gives me a good perspective of Western and Eastern influence. Perhaps, a good tool in reinforcing current efforts of promoting peaceful coexistence and development in the West Philippine Sea,” Carlos said. Huang said he exchanged views on the China-Philippines friendship with Carlos and looked upon “a better future for our bilateral relations.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. delivered his first State of the Nation Address (Sona), giving a glimpse of his first few days in office and his plans for the next six years. Unlike his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos generally did not deviate from his written speech – mostly following each word and line to a T.   Marcos’ first Sona lasted for one hour and 13 minutes. In the end, Marcos said: “The state of the nation is sound.” Economic goals Marcos began his address by defining the economic targets the administration has set for the next six years—echoing the figures his economic team previously presented. According to Marcos, the administration’s goal is to have a 6.5 to 8 percent real gross domestic product growth annually between 2023 to 2028 and reduce the country’s poverty rate to 9 percent by 2028. Further, Marcos said tax administration reforms would be in place to increase revenue collection. Among the initiatives the administration will push, Marcos said, is the levying of a value-added tax on digital service providers. “The initial revenue impact will be around P11.7 billion in 2023 alone,” Marcos said. Agriculture Marcos, who serves as the concurrent agriculture chief, also focused on the critical issue of food security and the welfare of farmers and fishermen. He said the loans and financial assistance for farmers and fishermen would be an “institution” in his administration. Aside from institutionalizing loan programs, Marcos also vowed that the government would seek to provide cheaper farm inputs, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and feeds while modernizing the agriculture and livestock industry through science and technology.  Further, Marcos also disclosed his plans to impose a one-year moratorium on the payment of land amortization and interest payments. “A moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy,” Marcos said. Marcos also asked Congress to craft a law condoning the loans of agrarian reform beneficiaries.  Tourism, infrastructure, and digitalization Marcos said he would implement basic developments such as road improvements for easier access to tourism spots for the tourism sector. “We will also upgrade our airports and create more international airports to help decongest the bottleneck at the Manila International Airport,” Marcos said.  In terms of digitalization, Marcos said 30-million physical national IDs and 20-million digital IDs are expected to be issued by the end of the year.  Marcos also bared his order to the Department of Information and Communications: To establish the “Broad Band ng Masa” project. For infrastructure, Marcos said he would expand former president Duterte’s Build, Build, Build program. “Once again, I will not suspend any of the ongoing projects as those have already been shown to be of benefit to the public that they serve,” Marcos said. Health and social welfare Marcos said no more lockdowns will be imposed in the country despite the increase in COVID-19 infections.  The President also promised to establish the Philippines’ own Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a vaccine institute while stressing the need to establish more health centers and hospitals across the country. “One of the cornerstones of a strong healthcare system is the provision of competent and efficient medical professionals. We will exert all efforts to improve the welfare of our doctors, nurses, and other medical frontliners,” Marcos said.  Marcos also made his order to the Department of Social Welfare and Development clear: Implement faster response for calamity victims. “Ang mga field office nila ay inatasan na maagang maglagak ng family food packs at non-food essentials sa mga LGU, bago pa man manalasa ang anumang kalamidad,” Marcos said.  Marcos said there should also be better coordination between the DSWD and the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development for the improved implementation of the “Emergency Shelter Assistance Program” for calamity victims.  Marcos also echoed his earlier order to cleanse the list of beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps). Education Marcos backed the return to full face-to-face classes, saying Education Secretary and Vice-President Sara Duterte, is now preparing for its implementation in the next school year. “This is one of the reasons I have directed the Department of Health and the Department of the Interior and Local Government to undertake another rollout of booster shots,” Marcos said. The President also took note of the discussions on the K-to-12 education system, saying it is being carefully reviewed. “As for the ‘horror’ stories that we have heard about  the poor quality of educational materials and supplies that are being given to our schools — this must end!” Marcos said.  The country must also do better in the international rankings, especially regarding the STEM subject, said Marcos. Marcos said it is up to the country’s educational system to develop and refine its incredible talent pool.  Foreign policy and migrant workers Regarding foreign policy, Marcos said he would “not preside over any process that will abandon even a square inch of the territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power.” “With respect to our place in the community of nations, the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all. And an enemy to none,” Marcos said. “The Philippines has always been open and welcoming to all our foreign friends and visitors. That is our world view, and that is our culture,” he added. Meanwhile, Marcos said the government would launch a command center that mainly focuses on overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in distress and needing to be repatriated back to the Philippines. Marcos also vowed to remove red tape in pursuing digital empowerment, noting plans to automate the verification of contracts and issue secure  Overseas Employment Certifications that can be kept in smartphones. He called on the Department of Migrant Workers to make this initiative a top priority. The President also said the Philippine government is coordinating with the government of Saudi Arabia to open deployment to the mid-eastern country. Priority measures In the latter part of his speech, Marcos laid down his priority measures which are as follows: National Government Rightsizing Program (NGRP) Budget Modernization Bill; Tax Package 3: Valuation Reform Bill Tax Package 4: Passive Income and Financial Intermediary Taxation Act (PIFITA) E-Government Act Internet Transaction Act or E-Commerce Law Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery (GUIDE) Medical Reserve Corps National Disease Prevention Management Authority Department of Water Resources Unified System of Separation, Retirement and Pension E-Governance Act National Land Use Act National Defense Act Mandatory Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) and National Service Training Program (NSTP) Enactment of an Enabling Law for the Natural Gas Industry Amendments to the Electric Power Industry Reform Act or EPIRA Amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Law “We have assembled the best Filipino minds to help navigate us through this time of global crisis,” Marcos said. “We will endure. Let our Filipino spirit ever remain undimmed. I know this in my mind, in my heart, in my very soul that,” he added.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri  was officially  installed as Senate President on Monday.    At the opening  day of the 19th Congress, Zubiri was  unanimously elected Senate president  by  his colleagues  after six  of 24 senators  nominated him for the post. The six who nominated  Zubiri for the top Senate post were Senators Joel Villanueva, Loren Legarda,   Jinggoy Estrada,  Grace Poe, Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa,  and JV Ejercito. “This institution must serve the Filipino people, and with Senator Zubiri at its helm, steering and charting its course, it can do much more,”  Villanueva  said.   He also  described  Zubiri  as “the most qualified and eligible”  to lead the upper chamber. “For the above reasons and more, I nominate the gentleman from Bukidnon, Senator Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, as our next Senate President,” he then said. No one objected when Villanueva  later moved to elect  Zubiri  as the new Senate leader. Senator Pia Cayetano and her  brother, Alan Peter Cayetano, later took the floor and manifested that they did  not participate in the voting as they opted to become independent. Senators  Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel  III and  Risa Hontiveros said they also abstained  from the voting.  Before assuming his new  post, Zubiri served as the Senate Majority Floor Leader in the 18th Congress.     He was elected  Senate President Pro Tempore  before Congress  adjourned last June 4 to  ensure the continued discharge of powers and duties of the Senate leadership until the opening of a new Congress. After winning his  reelection bid in the last May senatorial  race, Zubiri was among those immediately  mentioned as  one of the possible contenders for the top Senate post. Senator  Cynthia  Villar was also reportedly eyeing the position but later declared her support for Zubiri’.  “A united Senate is a productive one. From the very beginning, I’ve always wanted to form a supermajority in the Senate, so I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart Ma’am Cynthia Villar,”  Zubiri then said. Key positions in the  Senate had  also been filled up and announced even during the adjournment of Congress following separate meetings with various  blocs in the  upper chamber. Legarda, for instance, was already named then as Senate President Pro Tempore while  Villanueva is the new Senate Majority Leader.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"It’s all about the economy and the “entire cycle” of challenges facing the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will devote his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday to key issues he believes Filipinos care deeply about, especially the economic recovery program, the government’s pandemic response, the return of face-to-face schooling, and the food security crisis, according to Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez.   “It’s all about our economy, the economic plans. With the face-to-face opening of this coming school year, it’s all about COVID response. And when we speak of COVID response, it’s not only about health. It goes all the way to the entire cycle,” he told reporters on Friday. “[So it’s] not just health, you go into economy, you go into education, and so on and so forth,” Rodriguez said. The president had planned to burn the midnight oil over the weekend to fine-tune his speech to be delivered before Congress at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City. He was intending to work on the draft “until morning of Monday to finalize his SONA message,” the Malacañang official said. Rodriguez claimed that Marcos had been personally writing his own lines. “It’s a work in progress,” he only said when asked for details such as how many pages or how long the speech would be. The official said digitization or the adoption of digital technology by the government to improve efficiency and promote innovation would also figure prominently in the Sona. “In terms of governance, he [Marcos] wants to see a ‘digitalized’ governance and ‘digitalized’ administration,” Rodriguez said. Food sovereignty Another subject the president plans to spend some time discussing is food security and sovereignty, he said. “That’s why he took head-on the portfolio of the Department of Agriculture because he is aware of the impending food price crisis and probably food supply crisis,” Rodriguez said. “But for now, we are really confronted with the food price crisis. For the supply, except for the supply chain, I hope we will — under his leadership — be able to institute measures to mitigate its impact on us,” he said.   Marcos also wants to highlight the need to achieve food sovereignty, “meaning we don’t have to rely on much importation anymore,” said Rodriguez, adding: “If we can feed ourselves as a nation, and if we can feed ourselves as Filipinos, I think we are on our way to where we want to be, much like where our neighbors are.” Rodriguez did not identify any specific bills the president would ask the Senate and the House of Representatives to prioritize, but Biñan City Rep. Marlyn Alonte on Sunday said she hoped Marcos would push for legislation on local vaccine production amid an upswing in COVID-19 cases. She said she would be joining the move in the House for the establishment of a Center for Disease Control and of a Virology/Microbiology Institute, as well as proposed measures on the medical, nursing, and medical technology professions. According to Alonte, “local production of vaccines can create new jobs for graduates of health professions and engineering courses. We have the ecozones and industrial estates here in Biñan and in different parts of the country where vaccine production can be done.” She noted that the Department of Trade and Industry announced last year that the Board of Investments was in talks with seven local firms for the production of vaccines and plans to set up a full-scale vaccine manufacturing facility. After his speech, according to Rodriguez, Marcos will busy himself with the proposed 2023 budget, which must be submitted to Congress within 30 days after the opening of its session in accordance with the Constitution. Maximum tolerance Some 22,000 law enforcers have been deployed for Marcos’ first SONA, including police officers and force multipliers from other agencies, such as the Bureau of Fire and Protection, Presidential Security Group, and Metro Manila Development Authority. On Sunday, police officers were told to exercise maximum tolerance, even as Philippine National Police director for operations Maj. Gen. Valeriano de Leon warned that “unruly” protesters would be arrested. “There is no sense in any unnecessary confrontation. We fully respect the rights of some groups to assemble and air their grievances but we also expect them to respect our personnel on the ground who will be deployed to ensure peace and order for everybody,” De Leon said. On Saturday, the PNP set up random checkpoints under Task Force Manila Shield as part of security preparations ahead of the Sona.  As of midnight Sunday, at least nine individuals had been arrested and six firearms and weapons confiscated under a gun ban that is in effect from July 22 to 27, PNP spokesperson Col. Jean Fajardo told dzBB radio. The PNP said it made adjustments to its security plan after the Quezon City government allowed progressive groups to hold protests along Commonwealth Avenue, earlier designated as a “no-rally zone.” With the decision of City Hall to grant a rally permit, anti-Marcos groups shall be allowed to assemble and march from Elliptical Road up to the corner of Tandang Sora Avenue. Pro-Marcos demonstrations, on the other hand, shall be permitted along IBP Road in Batasan Hills, much closer to the Batasang Pambansa complex. “We have already completed some recalibration of our security measures as a result of the decision to allow some groups to hold their activities in some portions of Commonwealth Avenue,” De Leon said. The tight security measures prompted the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Sunday to remind the police to “exercise maximum tolerance during peaceful protests” as the country listens to Mr. Marcos’ first SONA. In a statement, CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said the authorities must protect the public’s right to peaceful protest in the same manner that it seeks to maintain order. As such, the commission “strongly advised” the police not to use water cannons or firearms during expected protest actions, and to disperse mobilizations in compliance with human rights standards. “The use of force must be avoided and restricted to the minimum extent necessary when handling nonviolent protests,” De Guia said, adding that the CHR would dispatch its own investigators and lawyers to monitor SONA rallies for any abuses.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Loren Legarda has filed a bill that seeks to check on excessive fees imposed by remittance firms on money sent by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to their families in the Philippines. In a statement, Legarda said Senate Bill No. 10 aims to allow the government to clamp down on unjust charges imposed by “intermediaries or financial institutions” on OFW remittances, noting how the fees usually deplete the money sent to its intended beneficiaries.   “It is imperative for the government to protect the money transfers from several fees and incredulous interest rates imposed by financial institutions,” Legarda said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"One of the projects of then Vice President Leni Robredo in support of the pandemic response is making a comeback. Robredo on Wednesday night announced she was reopening the Bayanihan e-Konsulta program, this time as one of the initiatives of her newly launched Angat Buhay Foundation.   The medical teleconsultation service was introduced in April 2021, as travel remained restricted at the height of the health crisis, as part of the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) Covid-19 response programs. As an outpatient service for COVID-19 and other cases, it was also intended to help decongest hospitals. The project was terminated on May 31 this year, a month before the end of Robredo’s term. In a Facebook post, Robredo said Angat Buhay would be reviving e-Konsulta because the country was again seeing an increase in Covid-19 infections over the past few weeks. Early sign-ups Pending the announcement of the relaunch date, she initially called for at least 50 nonmedical volunteers (who serve as call bridging agents and chat support) and 40 medical volunteers (doctors and nurses) to help put the program back. All volunteers will be operating under a remote work setup, so they must have their own gadgets and internet connection. At least 1,100 netizens signed up within 20 minutes after Robredo posted the call on social media. She thanked them for demonstrating how the spirit of volunteerism—one of the hallmarks of her presidential campaign—remained “alive and well.” Before terminating the project in May, Robredo said the teleconsultation service was able to help some 58,000 patients and had 947 volunteer doctors and 1,761 call and chat agents. Through Angat Buhay, the former vice president said she planned to replicate most of her OVP programs at the community level and that e-Konsulta in particular could continue under the postpandemic “new normal.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"It’s all systems go security-wise for the first State of the Nation Address (Sona) of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) said on Wednesday. According to the NCRPO, concerned government and non-government agencies have committed their resources and set up an interagency deployment strategy to ensure the success of Sona on July 25.   “With a strong interagency deployment of more than 22K hot bodies, we can confidently say that we are ALL SET for the Sona 2022,” Police Major General Felipe Natividad said at the second inter-agency coordinating conference. Deployment plans of subtask groups will ensure that no “foreseeable security glitch” will occur on the first presidential Sona as they are determined to follow security templates, said the NCRPO. These include the gun ban and other protective measures, intensive road clearing operations, and ensuring alternative routes are accessible for public transit. To make way for government officials and guest vehicles entering the Batasan complex, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said that it would reroute traffic and open a zipper lane on Commonwealth Avenue. A “No Rally Zone” will soon go into effect on Commonwealth Avenue, while a “No Fly Zone” will apply to aerial vehicles, including drones, above the venue. Unauthorized drone flight may result in asset loss for the owner. In line with the rerouting plan, motorists are advised to take the following alternate routes: NORTHBOUND (Quezon Memorial Circle to Fairview)– Vehicles from Elliptical Road should take North Avenue, turn right at Mindanao Avenue, then turn right to Sauyo Road or take Quirino Highway, then Commonwealth Avenue to reach the point of destination SOUTHBOUND (Fairview to Quezon Memorial Circle)– Vehicles from Commonwealth Avenue should take Sauyo Road or Quirino highway, turn left at Mindanao Avenue, then turn left at North Avenue to reach the point of destination   Motorists using light vehicles may also opt to take: NORTHBOUND (Quezon Memorial Circle to Fairview via Marikina)– Light vehicles from Elliptical Road (QMC) should turn right at Maharlika St., turn left at Mayaman St., turn right at Maginhawa St., turn left at C.P.

This event being a reflection of our character as a nation, I enjoin the public to observe policies and security procedures to be implemented to uphold public safety during the event,” Natividad said.",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Sherwin Gatchalian is looking at increasing or adding more taxes on wealthy individuals to generate more government income. Gatchalian, poised to become the next chairman of the Senate committee on ways and means in the 19th Congress, was asked during a tax forum in the Senate on Wednesday if he was planning to file a measure seeking to tax the wealthy.   “Yes, we’re looking; personally, I’m also looking at that and also looking at probably some space in the non-essential goods or goods that are not considered as basic necessities,” Gatchalian replied. “I’m not yet sure whether to increase — to put an additional tax or to increase the tax rate, but I’ll be looking at the concepts,” he added. The senator noted that wealthy individuals are currently taxed through their withholding tax. The jurisdiction of the ways and means panel are all matters relating to revenue generally, taxes and fees, tariffs, loans and other sources and forms of revenue.   ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Social Welfare Secretary Erwin Tulfo on Tuesday said 1.3 million Filipino households had “graduated” from extreme poverty and would no longer receive conditional cash grants from the government, freeing up to P15 billion for new beneficiaries of the poverty reduction program. Tulfo reported the plan by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to delist these beneficiaries to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. during the third Cabinet meeting of the new administration on Tuesday, according to Press Secretary Trixie Cruz Angeles.   The number of beneficiaries to be delisted is more than 25 percent of the 4.4 million households which are recipients of the conditional cash transfer, or Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps). “This frees up P15B for other qualified persons to replace them and now be included in the 4Ps program,” Angeles said in a statement. In a phone interview with reporters, Tulfo said the DSWD made the move after he received a “marching order” from the president to review the conditional cash transfer program first implemented by the Arroyo government and expanded by the Aquino administration. He said the DSWD was investigating 600,000 more households to determine whether they were still qualified to benefit from the program, which provides cash to the poorest of the poor families to help maintain essential nutritional needs, keep young children in school and obtain basic health care. Asked what the President’s reaction was to his report, Tulfo said: “He looked at me, surprised. He looked surprised.” Cleaning up the list But did Mr. Marcos support the planned delisting? “Yes,” Tulfo replied. “It was his marching order to clean the 4Ps list.” “They are not considered anymore as poor,” he said of the large number to be removed from the list of 4Ps beneficiaries. He said the DSWD’s national targeting office, which determines who are supposed to be included in the 4Ps, only had “poor and nonpoor” on its list. “If you are poor, you continue to be in the 4Ps. Once you are nonpoor, we have to take you out. If you are nonpoor, you are no longer qualified,” he said.   In a July 14 television interview, Tulfo said that those who had “graduated” from the 4Ps “can now stand on their own two feet.” “They can survive day-to-day and then their children, they may have graduated [from school] so they are no longer qualified,” the DSWD chief said. The 4Ps poverty reduction strategy was institutionalized by Republic Act No. 11310 signed in 2019 by Mr. Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. As a permanent government program, it would get yearly allocations from the national budget. The program is conditioned on the beneficiary families’ commitment to achieve target outcomes in health and education. Qualified beneficiaries include farmers, fishermen, homeless families, indigenous peoples, those from the informal sector and those living in isolated and disadvantaged areas, especially those without electricity. Under the law, the monthly education grant is P300 per child enrolled in day care and elementary school for a maximum of 10 months a year, and P500 per child enrolled in junior high school and P700 per child enrolled in senior high school. A compliant beneficiary also receives a P750 monthly health grant and P600 monthly rice subsidy. According to the DSWD, a total of P89.7 billion in cash grants was released to about 4.3 million households last year alone. The program as a whole provides “social assistance” in the form of monetary support and “social development” aimed at breaking the “intergenerational poverty cycle” by giving the poorest Filipino families the means to invest in health and education.  Report the ‘unqualified’ Tulfo told the Inquirer that he would ask the help of the public to clean up the list of beneficiaries by offering a reward to anyone who can give information about households or persons who are 4Ps beneficiaries but unqualified to receive the cash benefits. He clarified, however, that the reward system would not be implemented this month while the DSWD scrutinized the 4Ps list. Under the bounty program which may be implemented as early as September, a tipster can receive P1,000 for each nonpoor name he can provide to the DSWD hotline or official Facebook page. Five names could earn the informant P5,000, but only if the DSWD social workers verify them. Dating back to Arroyo years “This is to make sure that we are not leaving any people [on the 4Ps list] who are not supposed to be there receiving money instead of the people who deserve the help,” Tulfo told the Inquirer in a phone interview. “We are just making sure that our list is real and clean, that the people receiving the ayuda [aid] are the right persons who need the ayuda,” he said. Tulfo said the President will get a “clean” copy of the list once finalized by the DSWD, but this could take weeks. The current list contains the names of beneficiaries from as far back as 2009 during the Arroyo administration, Tulfo said. The 4Ps law states that the cash aid could be given to poor households for a maximum of seven years. Tulfo said that the reward system could help save money for the government if the minimum P1,200 monthly that an unqualified beneficiary could receive were taken into account.  An investigation team which Tulfo will later form will verify an informant’s tip with help from social workers. “When we say ‘nonpoor,’ it means you can afford to buy home appliances, furniture, and then if you are a 4Ps beneficiary yet you can afford an air conditioner, then how can you afford that?” Tulfo said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Risa Hontiveros has sounded the alarm on a thriving underground market for photos and videos of Filipino children on Facebook public groups that apparently cater to sexual predators. The chair of the Senate committee on women and children said her team discovered that the groups were either posting lewd images of minors to attract an audience or selling the photos or videos on more secure messaging apps, such as Telegram.   At least six different Facebook groups named “LF bunso and kuya (looking for youngest and older brother)” had as many as 24,000 followers, with about 50 posts a day, Hontiveros said. Other groups went by the name “atabs,” from the Filipino word “bata” or child spelled backwards, she said. “It is sickening to see how many people brazenly abuse our young people. They use Facebook and Telegram to transact and sell thousands of pictures and videos, while others use cloud storage platforms like Mega because of the large volumes,” she said on Tuesday. Hontiveros shared screenshots of some of the pages with the perpetrators posting photos of scantily-clad young girls and luring users to join chat groups where the trade for nude photos or videos was allegedly taking place. “Who wants atabs vid (video)? PM lang po, load lang kapalit (send me a private message, will send video in exchange for cell phone load),” one user said. “Baka want nyo. Mura lang. GCash only (You may want this. It’s cheap.

One is shown to contain as many as 167 gigabytes of material, based on the screenshots. Urgent bill The thriving illicit trade should prompt President Marcos to immediately sign into law the anti-online sexual abuse and exploitation of children (OSAEC) bill, Hontiveros said. “As a mother, I am more worried for the security of our children on the internet,” she said in a statement, adding: “The internet has become a way of life for our youth; but this should not play a part in their abuse and exploitation, whether online or offline.”   Hontiveros said she was appalled by the discovery of the predatory groups, only days after her social media followers succeeded in getting the “Usapang Diskarte” Facebook page and YouTube channel taken down for supposedly giving subscribers tips on how to prey on children. Facebook and YouTube took down the page and channel, respectively, after the senator’s followers acted en masse to report the account. Takedowns not enough But taking down online platforms engaging in these activities is not enough, Hontiveros said. “Even if these are reported, they will only keep on putting up more pages with the use of other accounts. Social media platforms and messaging applications should now be more proactive in stopping these activities that gravely harm our children,” she said. The senator called for the immediate passage of the draft OSAEC law “to genuinely hold the perpetrators and the social media platforms and their internet intermediaries who have allowed this hideous trade to proliferate.” The measure, Senate Bill No. 2209, is now awaiting the President’s signature after it was passed in the 18th Congress. Its enrolled version was transmitted to Malacañang on June 29. Unless vetoed, the enrolled bill will lapse into law on July 28. ISPs must cooperate It prohibits, among others, the “production, direction, manufacture, facilitation or creation” of any form of exploitative material that facilitates child sexual abuse, or participation in such acts. It also makes it unlawful to publish, offer, transmit, sell, distribute, broadcast, advertise, promote, export or import such content. Mere possession of the material is already deemed illegal. Under the bill, “intermediaries,” such as internet service providers, content hosts, hosting services, online payment platforms and electronic money issuers, are required to cooperate with law enforcement agencies for the prosecution of offenders. They should, for example, identify the users and report their activities to the police.  The ISPs and other intermediaries are also duty-bound to take down or restrict access to any page involved in child sexual exploitation. The bill imposes a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of up to P5 million. Government employees convicted of the offense face dismissal from the service and a ban from public office.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian on Tuesday said he had filed a bill that would set up free public Wi-Fi in all public schools nationwide. Gatchalian said Senate Bill No. 383 seeks to “accelerate the digital transformation of the basic education sector,” in compliance with Republic Act No. 10929, or the Free Internet Access in Public Places Act.   “We will be pushing for the digital transformation of the education sector to make sure that each school in the country has access to the internet. I believe that after the pandemic, blended learning will become part of the new normal, so we need to expand the use of technology to deliver quality education,” he said. Under Gatchalian’s proposal, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) will accelerate the installation, deployment and activation of free public Wi-Fi in all levels of public schools. Data from DICT showed that only 945 public schools have free public Wi-Fi, or a mere 2 percent of all public schools in the country.  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Risa Hontiveros expressed alarm on Tuesday as more online groups are made to prey on children. Hontiveros said that public groups on Facebook named Atabs and LF Kuya and Bunso post images of minors to lure predators.   The Facebook groups have also been utilized for advertising their sale of children’s photos or videos on Telegram and other messaging applications. “Nakakasuklam at nakakagalit na may mga taong tahasang nang-aabuso sa ating kabataan. Gamit na rin nila ang Facebook messenger or Telegram para mag-usap at magbenta ng libo-libong mga pictures at videos. Ang iba, gumagamit pa ng cloud storage tulad ng Mega dahil napakalaki ng volume,” Hontiveros decried in a statement. (It is disgusting and offensive that some people outright abuse children. They use Facebook messenger or Telegram to talk and sell thousands of pictures and videos. Others even use cloud storage like Mega because the volume is huge.) “Bilang ina, mas lalo akong nangangamba sa seguridad ng ating mga anak sa internet. Kailangang maipasa na ang Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) Law para tunay na mapanagot ang mga salarin at pati ang mga social media platforms at internet intermediaries na hinahayaang lumaganap ang kabastusang ito,” she added. (As a mother, I worry about the safety of our children on the internet. The Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children Law needs to be signed to hold perpetrators liable and even social media platforms and internet intermediaries that allow these abuses to proliferate.) Hontiveros is the principal author and sponsor of the Anti-OSAEC bill. Recently, the senator also exposed the Facebook and YouTube accounts of Usapang Diskarte, which shared tips to his viewers on how to persuade a minor into having sexual activity. The social media platforms then took down the accounts following Hontiveros’ call to report the pages. However, she said that taking down the page or channel is not enough. Hence, renewing her call to sign the Anti-OSAEC bill into law.   “Hindi sapat na nate-take down lang ang mga page o channel. Kahit ma-i-report online, gagawa at gagawa lang din sila ng panibagong accounts. Maging proactive na dapat ang mga social media platforms at messaging apps sa pagsugpo ng mga gawaing nakakapahamak sa mga bata,” she said. (Taking down a page or channel is not enough. Despite reports online, they will just create new accounts. Social media platforms and messaging apps should be proactive in combating activities that are harmful to children.) “Parte na ng buhay ng ating kabataan ang internet. Pero hindi dapat maging parte ang karahasan at pangaabuso sa kanila — offline man o online. Gawin na natin ang lahat para matiyak ang kaligtasan ng ating mga anak. Ipasa na ang Anti-OSAEC Law,” Hontiveros appealed. (The Internet is part of our children’s lives. But, harassment and abuses against them should not be part of it — offline or online. So, let us do everything to ensure our children’s safety. Sign the Anti-OSAEC law.)  ",0

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has decided to retain the COVID-19 alert level system while a new health restrictions classification is being studied. The decision came after Marcos met with officials from the Department of Health (DOH) on Monday.   According to Marcos, the new health restriction classification needs to be more compatible with the “current milder strains that afflict the patients.” “To avoid confusion, we will retain the alert level system for now. We are, however thinking, we are studying very closely, and we’ll come to a decision very soon as to decoupling the restrictions from the alert levels,” Marcos said during a meeting as quoted in a press release of the Palace on Tuesday morning. DOH officer-in-charge Ma. Rosario Vergeire said the health department could come up with a new alert level classification by the second week of August. Vergeire added that experts project that if eligible individuals do not get vaccinated, the country will witness increased hospitalizations by September. IATF functions Meanwhile, for the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the DOH has decided to reconstitute the member agencies “to only those with relevant and intended functions”, according to the Palace.  Citing Vergeire, the Palace said the IATF meetings and processes will be streamlined and will be utilizing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council platform. “The platform will replace the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to integrate it with the regular processes,” the Palace said. “This will allow the IATF health expert groups to continue their work as they serve as the voice of science in the country,” it added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will have to be consulted regarding the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the Philippines to comment on ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan’s move to resume the investigation into former President Rodrigo Duterte’s violent war on drugs, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said on Monday. “There are state sovereignty issues involved. We need to cover those points, first and foremost,” Guevarra told reporters via Viber.   “[The president] has not had the occasion to discuss the ICC case thoroughly with anyone. But I intend to consult with him about it very soon,” he said. Guevarra, the justice secretary during the Duterte administration, said the Office of the Solicitor General was already studying several legal options in dealing with the ICC probe. The Philippine government, he said, may question the jurisdiction of the ICC and the “admissibility of the case” as Duterte and his subordinates had done previously. The solicitor general said the government might also opt to “leave our lines of communication with the ICC open.” He said any decision on the matter will have to be discussed with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice, international law experts, and the Office of the President. PH withdrawal from ICC Duterte, himself a lawyer, had claimed that the ICC lost its jurisdiction over him when he announced in March 2018 the Philippines’ withdrawal as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty that created the tribunal. But former ICC Judge Raul Pangalangan, the first Filipino jurist who served in the international tribunal, had maintained that the withdrawal will not protect Duterte from the ICC probe or for him to evade responsibility for the deaths of tens of thousands of alleged victims of the drug war. Meanwhile, Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa reiterated on Monday that he will not cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the ICC on the killings linked to the government’s war on drugs, insisting it did not have jurisdiction over the Philippines’ “domestic affairs.” In an interview, Dela Rosa maintained that the country’s courts remain operational, and can handle the prosecution of those involved in the “drug war” killings, including former President Duterte and himself.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Joseph Victor “JV”  Ejercito on Monday urged President Ferdinand “Bongbong”  Marcos Jr. to focus on his plans for economic recovery and pandemic response in his first State of the Nation Address (Sona). Ejercito said he hopes to “hear some specifics on the direction he wants to take for the country. His inauguration speech was inspiring, but his Sona needs to flesh out the details of his plan to address the challenges we face,” Ejercito said in a statement.   “He needs to come up with a plan that balances the need to protect our people from the current and future pandemic and the urgency of reviving our economy in the face of mounting debt, external pressures, and inflation,” he added. In terms of the economy, Ejercito said Marcos should discuss a comprehensive economic plan “that will go beyond proposals to raise existing taxes and levy new ones. There have been talks about raising taxes. However, this cannot be a stand-alone plan; rather, it should be part of a comprehensive economic blueprint that I hope will be discussed in the Sona,” Ejercito said. Meanwhile, Ejercito stressed a need to anchor the pandemic response to the Universal Healthcare Law, which he principally sponsored. Ejercito earlier refiled an amendment seeking to adjust current PhilHealth contribution schemes. “In fighting the pandemic, I hope the President anchors his strategy on the effective implementation of the Universal Health Care law so we can strengthen our healthcare system and provide our people with affordable and accessible healthcare,” Ejercito said. On infrastructure, agriculture Ejercito likewise expressed hopes that Marcos will discuss his plans to strengthen the Build, Build, Build program. “The President has promised during the campaign that he will improve former President Duterte’s Build, Build Build program. In the Sona, I hope he unveils his infrastructure development program,” Ejercito said. Further, the senator said the infrastructure development program must include projects that will modernize the transportation system, strengthen tourism, and allow efficient movement of people and goods in the country. The senator also called on Marcos to elaborate on his plan for food security amidst the impending food crisis in the country.   “There have been suggestions to the effect that the government should declare a State of Agricultural Emergency to allow the government to address the impending food crisis,” he said. “In principle, I am amenable to this but only if such is part of a comprehensive plan to ensure food security and there is legislative oversight,” he added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. ordered the Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday to come up with a farm-to-market road masterplan that will serve as a guide for the government. Marcos issued the order during his meeting with officials of the DA. The President currently serves as the concurrent secretary of the department.   During the meeting, Marcos said that the masterplan should include regional maps detailing the exact locations of the farm-to-market roads to be constructed. It shall also include funding source, payment terms, and timeframe for project implementation, the president said. “Kung sabihin nila saan ba ang areas na talagang kailangan nating buksan? We will go to Public Works. And also, what are the areas that we really want to open, that really need the farm-to-market road? Iyon ang unahin natin,” Marcos was quoted as saying in a press release.   (If they ask which areas we want to open? We will go to Public Works. And also, what are the areas that we really want to open, that really need the farm-to-market road? That’s what we need to address first.) According to Marcos, official development assistance-funded projects shall be constructed in priority areas identified by the government while state-funded projects shall be handled by the DA and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). “Farm-to-market road is the first step to solve some of the supply chain problem. So unahin muna natin ‘yung nagpo-produce,” Marcos said. In a separate tweet, Marcos said strengthening the farm-to-market road program is one of his priorities in the agriculture sector. “Prayoridad sa ating plano para sa agrikultura ay ang pagpapatibay ng programang ‘farm-to-market road’ at pagsusulong ng mga proyektong makakatulong sa ating mga kababayan sa sektor ng agrikultura,” Marcos said in a tweet. (Among our priorities in the agriculture sector is our plan to strengthen the “farm-to-market road” program and to push for projects that will help our countrymen in the agriculture sector.) DA Undersecretary Kristine Evangelista said Marcos has ordered a review and assessment of the current projects of the agriculture department.   “Right now, there’s a very thorough assessment of the program DA already has because we have to see which one of them actually works, which one has to be tweaked and which one needs further consultation with the stakeholders,” Evangelista said in an interview with reporters. “So ‘yun po ang mga utos din po ng ating mahal na Presidente (Those were the orders of the President) so he could come up with programs again based on the thrust of increasing production and making agricultural commodities affordable,” she added. Marcos earlier announced that he will temporarily head the agriculture department. Marcos said that the move to head the agriculture department will “make it clear to everyone what a high priority we put on the agriculture sector.”  ",0
Philippine Daily Inquirer,"No child will remain unregistered under a new bill in the Senate that seeks more protections for vulnerable children. “Birth registration is the first crucial step in establishing one’s legal identity and entitlement to state benefits,” Sen. Grace Poe said in filing Senate Bill No. 332, or the proposed Children in Need of Special Protection (CNSP) Birth Registration Act.   The bill paves the way for the registration of vulnerable Filipino children to assure them of state recognition and protection. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), 5 million Filipinos nationwide were unregistered as of 2019, of whom 40 percent were minors from newly born to 14 years old. “Guaranteeing our children’s right to have a legal name is giving them justice and an environment that is conducive to their growth and development. We must not be remiss in this foremost duty,” Poe said. Under her proposal, CNSP are defined as persons below 18 years, or even 18 years and older but unable to care for themselves due to physical or mental disability; or who are vulnerable to or victims of abuse, neglect, exploitation, cruelty, discrimination, violence, natural calamities, man-made disasters and other analogous conditions prejudicial to their development. CNSP include but are not limited to children who are sexually/physically abused, in situations of armed conflict, displaced, victims of child labor, street children and foundlings. “Nonregistration of children makes them invisible to the developmental radar of the state, which must include them in priority initiatives on health, nutrition, education and protection,” said Poe, herself a foundling who was adopted by the late actors Fernando Poe Jr. and Susan Roces. Poe was also one of the champions of the Foundling Recognition and Protection Act or Republic Act 11767, which promotes the rights and welfare of deserted or abandoned children with unknown parents or facts of birth by recognizing them as Filipino citizens. On the other hand, SB 332 gives authority to a licensed social worker, or persons or institutions with protective custody of the child to register him or her, in adherence to procedures. Registration shall be made in the Local Civil Registry Office where the child was born, if known; if unknown, in the place where the child was found.   The bill mandates that registration shall be carried out within 60 days from the date of actual custody of the child, except during armed conflict or disaster. Requirements for CNSP birth registration include: certification from the PSA that it has no record yet of the child’s birth; a licensed social worker’s case study of the child; and certification from the nearest regional office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development that the child is in need of special protection.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Chinese loans for three multibillion-peso railway projects that were to be major legacies of former President Rodrigo Duterte under his “Build, Build, Build” program have been scrapped as his administration bowed out, a transport official said on Friday. President Marcos is looking at renegotiating the loans with Beijing in the hope of securing the official development assistance loans as the government has no money to fund these projects, said Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).   Manila’s loan applications with state-owned China Eximbank for the three big-ticket railways are deemed withdrawn after former Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III “canceled the application instead of keeping it in suspended animation” due to the bank’s inaction, Chavez said. ‘Considered withdrawn’ The financing was for contracts—which were already awarded—covering the first package of the Philippine National Railways (PNR) Bicol project, the Subic-Clark Railway Project (SCRP) and the first phase of the Mindanao Railway Project (MRP). The Chinese government had not approved the loan applications that were submitted by the Philippine government in 2021-2022, Chavez told reporters on Friday. The Department of Finance (DOF) wrote to China Eximbank in May telling it that if it did not act on the country’s loan applications by the end of that month, these should be “considered withdrawn,” he said. “DOTr understands that this is in light of the upcoming transition of government, and in deference to the incoming administration,” Chavez said in a statement later. 3-percent interest China also did not provide the Philippines a shortlist of contractors and consultants for the projects, which is a prerequisite for a loan agreement, he said. Chavez said that the DOTr requested the list to show that it was keen on proceeding with getting Chinese financing for the projects. The loans would be settled only after the Philippines chooses contractors and consultants from the shortlist but the Chinese bank did not respond, he explained. “In short, China backed out,” Chavez said. The transport official said that the Chinese bank also was asking for 3-percent interest on the loans, much higher than the 0.01-percent rate charged by Japan. With the government not having enough funds to finance the projects, the Marcos administration would be considering the public-private partnership scheme as a financing option which it was banking to drive public infrastructure spending over the next six years, Chavez said.   The first package of the PNR Bicol project, with a cost of P142 billion, will link Calamba in Laguna to Daraga, Albay, via a 380-kilometer railway. This will cover the design, construction and electromechanical works of the project. DOF concern The P50-billion SCRP is a 71.13-km link between Subic Bay Freeport Zone and Clark Freeport Zone and would transport both freight and passengers. The P83-billion MRP’s first phase covers the 102-km Tagum-Davao-Digos route, envisioned to be the first rail line across Mindanao. It was expected to be completed by 2024-2025 and would reduce travel time to about an hour from 3.5 hours currently. On its own, the government could not finance the projects as the pandemic ravaged the economy and left it with less funds for any additional spending without undermining its overall financial standing. Asked if the government would seek loans from other agencies instead, Chavez declined to comment given that this was the concern of the finance department. Revisit projects The Marcos administration will check if potential loans from China for the three railway projects would still be feasible, according to Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno. “The new administration can revisit the projects,” Diokno said on Friday. “If found worthwhile, it may choose to restore the loan application, if funding is still available.” President Marcos’ chief economic manager did not reply when asked to comment on concerns that Chinese financing pledges for Philippine projects had been slow, even at the height of closer Manila-Beijing ties during the Duterte administration. Samal-Davao City connector In its last month in office, the Duterte administration borrowed 2.3 billion renminbi (about P17.4 billion) from China to build a bridge connecting the former president’s hometown Davao City to Samal Island in Davao Gulf. This was China’s last loan to the Duterte government and also its first official development assistance (ODA) denominated in the Chinese currency. In the past, the country’s ODA loans from China were denominated in US dollars, as the Philippines wanted parity and comparable interest rates with ODA loans from countries like Japan and South Korea as well as multilateral lenders.  This loan was slapped with an interest rate of 2 percent per annum, payable in 20 years plus a seven-year grace period. This Chinese financing for the four-lane Samal Island-Davao City connector will bankroll 90 percent of the project’s design-and-build contract amounting to P19.3 billion. In all, the Duterte administration borrowed from China a total of $1.1 billion. Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said that the withdrawal of the funding would be a blow not only to the projects but to the economy, too. “Delayed funding for these large infrastructure projects in the country from China would mean slower economic growth … and would also delay the economic growth and development in these rural areas along the path of these infrastructure projects,” he said. The railway projects are seen to connect more areas in the countryside, which can spur economic activities all along their routes. ‘Disappointing’ Sunny Sevilla, a former finance undersecretary who is coconvenor of Move As One Coalition (MAOC), told the Inquirer that the funding withdrawal was “disappointing, as the public had been led to believe that these projects would proceed.” Sevilla said it “would be good to better understand why the Chinese government no longer wishes to fund these projects, whether that decision was prompted by their assessment of the projects’ economic and financial viability,” urging the government as well to share its plans with the public. “In the meantime, we earnestly hope that the government will ensure that there is sufficient and reasonably priced road transport capacity to meet the needs of travelers who would have traveled between Subic and Clark, to Bicol, and in Mindanao,” the MAOC coconvenor said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) said Friday it “strongly recommends” offering amnesty to former rebels. In a statement following the first executive committee meeting of the NTF-ELCAC, National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos said the move seeks to “prevent the resurgence of the communist terrorist group.”   Carlos serves as the vice chairman of the NTF-ELCAC. “Under the administration of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., the NTF-ELCAC’s efforts to ensure peace and development for all Filipinos will continue,” Carlos said, reading the official statement of the task force. “The Task Force strongly recommends the need for offering an amnesty to prevent the resurgence of the communist terrorist group, especially in geographically challenges, isolated and disadvantaged areas,” she added. The details of the amnesty, however, are not yet finalized, said Carlos. She also said the decision to offer amnesty to former rebels is still up to Marcos. Meanwhile, Carlos said the executive committee likewise recommended reaffirming the importance of the whole-of-nation approach “in tackling the root causes of the armed conflict.” “We recommend the further commitment to implement and enhance the programs of the NTF-ELCAC’s various clusters in public services, empowering local governments, strengthening partnerships with stakeholders, ensuring peace and law enforcement in the communities, providing tailored assistance to former revels and former violent extremists, and work towards genuine healing and reconciliation,” she said.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has instructed the Department of Health (DOH) to look into issues affecting the benefits of health workers in the country, the health agency’s officer-in-charge (OIC) Ma. Rosario Vergeire said Friday. Vergeire said that as OIC of the DOH, one of her priorities, aside from the government’s COVID-19 vaccination drive and pandemic response, is to look into the issue of healthcare workers’ benefits.   “As we have said yesterday, part our priorities, and as instructed by the President, that we look into these issues that had been hounding the benefits of the health workers,” Vergeire said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel. “We are planning to start discussing these with the healthcare workers and of course looking at our implementing units, looking at the challenges and how we can be able to address this to facilitate the release of the benefits,” she added. Vergeire said she will pursue additional funding for the benefits of healthcare workers as she admitted that funds for the said program are “lacking.” Vergeire added that there are also funds that have been downloaded to the DOH’s Centers of Health Development for the benefits of healthcare workers. “We have also already mentioned during our talk with the president about two weeks ago that this is part of the priority of the department because we still lack funds so we can be able to pursue and continue this provision of funds for our healthcare worker benefits,” Vergeire said. “Kailangan lang ng additional funds para makumpleto natin at maibigay natin sa healthcare workers. We’re going to pursue this,” she added. (We need additional funds so we can complete and release the benefits for the healthcare workers.) According to her, there will be meetings with health care workers to discuss “minor things”, including requirements that need to be met by heads of health facilities for the release of the funds. “The issues would really be transactional compliance to requirements— some would be that there would be this non-signing of the memorandum of agreement if it’s a private hospital, the liquidation of the previous funds that were given to them,” Vergeire said. “They have to do that because we are in government and we have to follow the rules and regulations set for these auditing rules,” she added.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senator Mark Villar has filed a bill seeking to institutionalize the Build, Build, Build (BBB) program first implemented by the Duterte administration, where he served as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways that implemented the program. Villar’s proposed Build, Build, Build Act aims to form a 30-Year National Infrastructure Program.   “Importante po na isulong natin sa Senado ang Build, Build, Build program, dahil ang pagkakaroon ng pangmatagalang plano para sa programang pang-imprastraktura ay makakapagpalago ng ekonomiya ng bansa,” he said in a statement on Thursday. (It is important to push the Build, Build, Build program in the Senate because having a long-term plan for infrastructure programs will boost the country’s economy.) “It will ease the much-needed improvement of the nation’s roads, bridges, and other structures, while it aims to give thousands of jobs to the Filipino people,” he added. The bill contains policies and strategies that the government will pursue in determining the initial core infrastructure projects that will be prioritized. The Build, Build, Build Act provides modalities for financing and implementing infrastructure projects. The measure also identifies the role of implementing agencies in developing energy, water resources, transport, information and communications technology, social infrastructures, and other facilities in the nation.

The Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) was discussed during the meeting of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) in Malacanang on Wednesday.   Marcos attended via teleconferencing as he continued his isolation after contracting COVID-19. The president’s lead physician, however, has said that Marcos can end his isolation on July 15. “Sa ating pagpupulong kasama si NEDA Director-General Arsenio Balisacan, tinalakay kung paano mapapabilis ang pag-imprenta at distribusyon ng National ID cards upang magamit na ng ating mga kababayan simula sa unang bahagi ng taong 2023,” Marcos said in a Facebook post on Thursday.

Philippine Daily Inquirer,"Senators aired their support on the proposal to rightsize the bureaucracy on Wednesday. The backing of Senators Joel Villanueva, Francis Escudero, Loren Legarda, and Sonny Angara came after the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) pushed for the rightsizing to save government funds.   “We support moves from the national government to improve its efficiency and institutional capacity to deliver public service,” Villanueva said in a statement. While Villanueva supported the move, he raised two concerns: the unfilled 178,128 authorized government positions and the “significant” number of government workers under job order or contract of service. By addressing these questions, the DBM can determine which government agencies can be rightsized, said Villanueva. Escudero likewise agreed to rightsize, sharing that he did the same move when he was the governor of Sorsogon. “I believe that this is the right path to take insofar as the administration is concerned,” he told reporters in a message. “They just have to pour in the time to study which positions are redundant or unnecessary and to make sure that those that may be affected are given proper compensation on top of whatever benefits from [Government Service Insurance System] in order to help them get by and start anew amidst these trying economic times,” he added. Noting that she lodged a similar bill in the 17th Congress, Legarda favored DBM’s push to rightsize and said that she will refile it in the 19th Congress. “I fully support the proposal of DBM to rightsize the bureaucracy… There are government agencies that have functions that overlap or are redundant. This makes them ineffective and inefficient, and these also entail unnecessary expenses. Government efforts must be redirected toward carrying out its fundamental duties for the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery,” she said in a separate message to the media. For Angara, the call is “probably overdue” but he will not oppose the mandate of the DBM.   “I think the call to streamline the bureaucracy has been there for some time and is probably overdue. I personally would not be averse to delegating the power to the executive particularly the DBM as that is part of its mandate,” he said in a message to reporters as well. “Bukod sa paglikha ng pambansang budget nandyan din yung trabaho niya bilang tagapangasiwa ng Human Resources ng gobyerno,” the senator continued. (Aside from creating a national budget, it is the DBM’s job to be the government’s Human Resources manager.) Earlier, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman said that with the proposal, the government may save “a significant amount of the budget” that could be tapped as funding for programs in the sectors of infrastructure, social services, health, and agriculture.

Indeed, their foremost “thought leaders” are convinced that the catastrophic loss they suffered in this year’s national elections in which current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr won by a massive landslide is an outcome of a sinister “disinformation” campaign against their hapless leader Leni Robredo. Thus it is quite interesting to behold no less than former Congressman Teddy Baguilat, vice president for internal affairs of the Liberal Party, caught red-handed spreading “fake news”. In a tweet he has since deleted, Baguilat shared on Twitter an obviously fake quote card that featured House Representative Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Araneta Marcos III (1st District Ilocos Norte) stating… ""Why the big fuss about the prices of red onions? Common sense dictates that you use white onions when red onions are expensive and alternatively, you should use red onions when white onions are expensive. Simple problems need simple solutions."" …to which Baguilat sneers in Tagalog, “In short, ang gusto nila sabihin, mag tiis kayo. Pag ganyan ang problem-solving skills ng leaders natin, kawawa tayo. Sana solusyonan kung bakit nahihirapan ang farmers kya nagmahal…” (translated to English: “what they want to say is, suck it up. When our leaders’ problem solving skills are such, poor us. Why not just find a solution to address farmers’ hardships that result in higher prices”). The fake quote card bears the markings of Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI), evidence that there may, indeed, be a disinformation campaign being perpetrated by the Opposition camp. The network has since issued a statement condemning this act of sabotage… Rep. Marcos also responded to Baguilat’s deleted tweet pointing out the error in the former Congressman’s ways. This was not before eminent Opposition “journalists” Boo Chanco of The Philippine Star and Inday Espina Varona of Rappler had, themselves, contributed to the spread of this fakery. Fortunately for them, they had managed to delete their tweets before any further fallout and narrowly escaped Baguilat’s fate. One would think seasoned “journalists” like Chanco and Varona would know better, right? Note, however, that Chanco was not above making a snide remark about Rep. Marcos inadvertently revealing the root cause of his own foolish lapse in judgement. We see the same mindset in a half-assed apology issued by Baguilat on Twitter following his inexcusable gaffe… Nowhere in Baguilat’s apology tweet does he mention (i.e. add a “@sandromarcos7” to the tweet) Rep. Marcos. It’s typical of Yellowtard character — a lack of spine to, at least, directly address whoever they speak of. Baguilat’s intent was evidently to give the impression that he is apologising more to his followers while treating Marcos as a mere footnote in his “apology”. Such class acts indeed. It is one thing that they noisily beat the war drum against “disinformation” and appoint themselves God’s “Truth Tellers”. Yellowtard “journalists” like Baguilat (he was once one) as well as Boo Chanco and Inday Espina Varona have so far yet to prove that they walk their talk. Until then, hypocrisy pa more, ladies.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The Opposition uses religion whenever convenient. They have a special dispensation from the Catholic hierarchy in the country, specifically from Soc Villegas and Broderick Pabillo. This is actually very disrespectful..."" I really find it revolting how the opposition can use the name of the Lord God in vain for the sake of politics. In his PhilSTAR piece “Getting what we deserve?” today, columnist Boo Chanco suggests that “maybe God is using Duterte not only to punish us, but also to make us realize there is a better alternative if we only repent and change our ways.” He then calls to the heavens beseeching the Almighty to save the “good” but utterly desperate Yellowtard camp. ""There are those of us who think that if we get a servant-leader who is God-fearing and with the competence to run our government to replace Duterte, our problems are solved. If that’s all we need, let us make sure [Vice President Leni Robredo] is elected next May because she is all that… competent and a servant leader with the common good as her only motive to be in public office. We can pray for God to intervene and let VP Leni lead now."" What happened to all the religiosity which was one of the hallmarks of the Cory Aquino administration? Did that put a stop to corruption? Did her appointees think twice about entering into deals with cronies of former President Ferdinand Marcos and other scams which defrauded taxpayers? Did the emphasis on religion have any effect on the oligarchs who replaced the Marcos cronies? Not by any minuscule measure. The Opposition has really run out of ideas because they’re running plays from their old playbook. This is why Marcos is at center stage again in comparison with President Rodrigo Duterte. It’s guilt by association. You can’t help the feeling of deja vu when you see the success of Build, Build, Build and the biggest increase in spending for social services post-Marcos and, yet, the Opposition is still bent on demonizing the President. Chanco asserts that Leni Robredo is the leader we need. Not for anything but isn’t Robredo committing a sin by engaging in a relationship with a married man? They can try to bury this all they want but it’s an open secret as far as the public is concerned. This doesn’t make Robredo any different from our other politicos who are Lotharios in real life. At least, they aren’t hypocrites like she is. In 2015, Rappler came out with a story that it thought would be enough to damage Duterte’s reputation — a piece about the accusations leveled by his wife when she filed for a declaration of nullity of marriage. It became a non-issue with Duterte coming clean with his relationship with Honeylet Avanceña and their daughter, Kitty. End of story. The public accepted that reality of Duterte’s personal life. In fact, they identified with it because some of them are in the same boat due to the absence of a divorce law. Robredo, on the other hand, is being packaged as a saint by people like Chanco when she doesn’t even come close to being one. The Opposition uses religion whenever convenient. They have a special dispensation from the Catholic hierarchy in the country, specifically from Soc Villegas and Broderick Pabillo. This is actually very disrespectful of the Filipino whom the Opposition regard as stupid enough to fall for this kind of propaganda up to now. We fell for that when Cory was up against Marcos — a time when the Church was still very influential. The “good” versus “evil” narrative is worn thin to the point that it’s so sheer that Pinoys can see through it now. The truth is the Duterte administration has achieved more in five years than the thirty years the Yellowidiots were in power. It is not about form. It is about substance and impact on the lives of ordinary Filipinos. God has a way of rendering justice to the oppressed and to those who use His name in vain. But you have to give it to the Opposition to be so evil to the point of being unconscionable. This is their true character. Diabolical.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Yellowtard rhetoric which Big Media almost exclusively broadcast and published in the 1980s and 1990s utterly dominated the airwaves and print media. There was no debate around what was or what wasn’t 'fake news' — because there was no other way to disseminate news than via Big Media."" Back in the heyday decades of Yellowtardism in the 1980s and 1990s, mass communication was pretty much a one-way street. The ability to efficiently reach a mass audience was a capitalist monopoly — held by those who possessed the means to organise enterprises that could build and operate what today are regarded as conventional broadcast and print facilities (television, radio, and newspapers). The only way ordinary people could put up a challenge to the vast information dissemination machine of Big Media was through conventional street-level protest activism — rallies and pickets, distribution of leaflets and pamphlets, and, beginning in the mid-1990s via text messaging and email forwarding. Suffice to say, the might of Big Media utterly dwarfed pedestrian chatter. Even the running of so-called “mosquito presses” in the form of school publications and “underground newspapers” were as capital-intensive and also prone to monopolisation by powerful interest groups (in the case of campus newspapers such as the University of the Philippines’ Philippine Collegian and others like it in other big schools, primarily Leftist and Communist elements). “Citizen journalism” may have existed before the term was concocted by today’s social-media-beholden hipsters but its practitioners could neither compete with Big Media nor the “mosquito presses” monopolised by Leftists and commies. Thus it could be said that Yellowtard rhetoric which Big Media almost exclusively broadcast and published in the 1980s and 1990s utterly dominated the airwaves and print media. There was no debate around what was or what wasn’t “fake news” — because there was no other way to disseminate news than via Big Media. And unlike today where, thanks to the Internet and social media, ordinary people regard their ability to routinely challenge “news” and opinion distributed through Big Media outlets, as an entitlement and a right, back in the 1980s and 1990s, Big Media “news” and opinion remained utterly unchallenged. In short, Filipinos took it for granted that Yellowtard ideology was authentic and correct because, well, it was the only ideology Big Media broadcast. Indeed, even today, in the age of ubiquitous Internet access, high social media penetration and usage, and, as a result of these, commoditised mass communication, the ascendancy of information disseminated via Big Media still remains difficult to challenge. We see this in the way Philippine Mainstream Media has exerted its influence on the positions Western corporate media and Western non-government organisations take on Philippine political issues despite many of the assertions the industry makes about the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte being subject to debate and the object of wide dispute. Indeed, it is quite telling that even in this day and age, the ability of an opaque organisation such as the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) — an organisation that refuses to subject itself and its doctrine to critical scrutiny — to disseminate not just dubious but downright incorrect information routinely goes unchallenged. In that sense, the liberal ideas and emotional rhetoric of Yellowtards achieved its zenith at a time when ordinary people lacked the tools to directly challenge its wealthy purveyors. With the benefit of 21st Century context, it is easy to see that the rise of Yellowtard thinking happened on the back of the unfair advantage it enjoyed over competing ideas. It is no better than how Catholicism spread — by the sword and by suppressing or overpowering competing ideas. The fact is, the only people and groups uncomfortable with and driven into a panic by the chaotic nature of today’s Internet-fuelled discourse are those who have traditionally enjoyed the advantage in capital resources to reach a mass audience. That advantage may be gone today thanks to the Internet, but evidently not gone is these people and groups’ outsized sense of entitlement to monopolise the discourse. The notion of “fake news” applied to everything beyond the small subset that it is validly applicable to represents a strawman this entitled group put up to represent everything that threatens said entitlement. Blocking dissent does not make dissent go away. All this does is blind you to the rise and spread of competing ideas and hasten your failure to respond to its spread effectively. Facebook, for example, is now paying lip service to calls to crack down on “fake news”. Yet, just as nobody foresaw the rise of social media back in the early 2000s, nobody can foresee the unintended consequences of one organisation artificially throttling user behaviour over a massive network such as the Internet within which it is a mere subset. Who knows what Next Big (Unforeseeable) Thing will come up that will start to eat Facebook’s lunch. Something out of the Dark Web? A new platform or protocol for connecting people or distributing ideas? Nobody knows. You need to know your enemy to fight it. And, often, it takes courage and humility (and a reduced sense of entitlement to a monopoly on righteousness) to commit to getting to know your enemy and competing rather than just whining about the world being “unfair”.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Thanks to the Yellowtards, the Philippines is currently ruled by two European overlords — one sitting in Rome and the other a laughable committee in judges’ robes in The Hague."" “Proud to be Pinoy” is an oft-heard phrase when it comes to world champion boxers and beauty pageant contestants. That’s because it makes perfect sense that the “winner” coming out of a couple of boys pounding one another silly on a ring or an array of girls strutting around in bikinis on a stage could be a source of national pride. That’s on one hand. On the other hand, it also makes perfect sense that pride in one’s country needs to also appeal to some higher sensibilities — like an ability to stand on one’s own two feet, make one’s own decisions, chart one’s own destiny, and do all that by being true to one’s self. Apparently, that source of pride does not resonate with today’s Philippine Opposition. Led by the Liberal Party (a.k.a., the Yellowtards), the Opposition prefer that Filipinos bow to the rulings of a foreign court when it comes to deciding on the best approach to sorting out their internal affairs. Inquirer columnist John Nery in his article “Duterte to ICC: I’m beyond accountability” today contributes to the din of shrill cries of “outrage” over the withdrawal of the Philippines from the International Criminal Court (ICC). Nery refers to this withdrawal as an “unmanly” act on the part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that “only reinforces the impression that he has manipulated the instruments of the government so as never to be held accountable”. Nery does not cite specifics around how exactly Duterte had “manipulated the instruments of the government” to his ends, but he does assert that it creates the “very condition that would invite the ICC Prosecutor to investigate a sitting head of state.” Nery says all that as if the ICC, by itself, has an intrinsic right to influence — even directly intervene — in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation like the Philippines. Of course, this is all lost in a corporate media talking head who is part of a political bloc who had, over almost two years, invited his colleagues in Western news media to slander his own country and its government on the back of dubious information he and his industry chums fed them. The pattern is quite evident now. The Oppostion led by the Yellowtards, in their increasing desperation, are laying bare the perverse reliance on Western political and cultural power that had long served as pillars of their sick ideology. Unfortunately their scramble to regain power had stripped the colour off the ideological morsels thay have been throwing at Filipinos revealing, like M&Ms sucked clean of their yellow sugary coating, the sad little wet nuts at their core. Nery, like the Western ideological parrot that he is, highlights the rather awkward word, “complimentarity” in ICC policy jargon to justify the imagined ascendancy with which the ICC is encouraged to meddle in Philippine domestic affairs… ""The ICC policy paper again: “Complementarity involves an examination of the existence of relevant national proceedings in relation to the potential cases being considered for investigation by the Office. This will be done bearing in mind the Office’s policy of focusing investigative efforts on those most responsible for the most serious crimes under the Court’s jurisdiction. Where relevant domestic investigations or prosecutions exist, the Office will assess their genuineness.” Nice try. One can easily tell that the ICC struggles from a monumental crisis of relevance today. It relies on pieces of “signed” paper and convolutespeak to back the vapourware that is its imagined “mandate” to serve as the beacon of Western goodness in a world of diverse politics. The Yellowtards, for their part, are using these texts much the way religious clerics use immense volumes of similarly-convoluted scripture to prop up their dying cults. Indeed, the Yellowtards have revealed themselves as no more than a cult — no better than organised religions that rely on a fear of damnation to keep their flock shuffling along the lines drawn for them from ivory towers up those “hills”. Thanks to the Yellowtards, the Philippines is currently ruled by two European overlords — one sitting in Rome and the other a laughable committee in judges’ robes in The Hague. Does being a European colony well into the second decade of the 21st Century make Filipinos proud? Duterte, in fact, follows a tradition of Asian heroes who sought to free their people from European domination. He has become a reminder that the so-called “heroes” put on pedestals by three decades of Yellowtard rule under the watch of a Roman overlord has done exactly the opposite. Bozos like John Nery would like to convince Filipinos that this is good. That makes people like him liars. It’s high time these liars are called out and exhibited not just to Filipinos but to all Asians for what they are — traitors to hundreds of years of effort to free Asia from Western European domination.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"Is Leni Robredo still relevant? Are both politically-active non-Yellowtards as complicit as their Yellowtard counterparts in contributing to artificially keeping Leni Robredo in the ""news""? This is actually a question that is not as easy to answer as one would think. The apparent landslide win of respective administration presidential and vice presidential candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte rather than herald a graceful acceptance of the people’s clear will has launched talk of Opposition presidential candidate Leni Robredo’s “KakamPink” campaign team to persist as a militant “movement”. This was a concept already raised back in December last year by Yellowtard “thought leaders” Richard Heydarian and John Nery. Heydarian in a tweet issued a fearless forecast that, should she lose these elections, Robredo will go on to create a movement that will “be a FORCE to reckon with for years to come!”. Nery, for his part in a Rappler piece that predates Heydarian’s tweet, posited “the emerging dual nature of the [Leni Robredo] enterprise, as both campaign and movement”. To their credit, both men were already seemingly suggesting even back then that Robredo’s campaign was on a trajectory to failure but that it was okay because it would morph into a movement anyway that would persist post elections.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Marcos’s memory lives on today because the Opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other Duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of Filipinos."" President Rodrigo Duterte’s niece Nuelle Duterte has, for several years now, been used as an Opposition poster girl by the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media organisations because she reportedly tells people she meets in New York (where she works as a “psychiatrist”) that her famous uncle “kills people”. In a recent Facebook post, Nuelle explores the idea that Filipinos are victims of “operant conditioning” which she describes as “a process of changing behavior by rewarding or punishing a subject each time an action is performed until the subject associates the action with pleasure or distress.” She then goes on to assert… ""The [Philippines] is being conditioned to accept that corruption is normal, extrajudicial killing is justified, and criticism is akin to rebellion. There’s something terribly wrong when people are so easily conditioned. That some even choose it over freedom of thought."" I’m of the impression that Nuelle grew up in Davao before she migrated to the US. I’m not privy to her age but I would assume she was still a child in the late 80s to early 90s when Davao City was akin to no man’s land after sunset. It is easy to say that Filipinos are being “conditioned” by Duterte. But this Duterte hasn’t experienced how Davao City was at its worst. She also wasn’t a resident of the National Capital Region (NCR) during the Aquino administration. Extra-judicial killings (EJKs) did not stop after the ascent of Cory to the Presidency. This was the policy because Fidel Ramos was Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief at the time and, subsequently, Defense Secretary. It is no secret that Ramos followed the dictates of the US when it came to counter-insurgency. He was also the head of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and the Integrated National Police (INP) thereafter under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. The Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs) became Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (CAFGUs) under his watch — paramilitary personnel in every barangay as part of the counter-insurgency strategy. The other Duterte must also be aware of narco-states of which Mexico is the leading example. Cartel violence has seen civilians in the crossfire. In Colombia, at the height of Pablo Escobar’s power, he held an entire country hostage through his vast wealth through murders of government officials and bombings that killed civilians. He even planted a bomb on an airliner. That Nuelle Duterte has become an Opposition icon because of her surname is typical. What makes it offensive is she isn’t even a Filipino citizen. She is not nuanced in what’s happening in the country in the same manner that other Fil-Ams are. Look at Ruben Carranza, a former PCGG commissioner, who turns out to have held US citizenship at the time he was appointed to a government position. As @benign0 postulates, our problem as a country is not only political but also socio-cultural. We have “journalist-activists” against the administration but in the payroll of the oligarchs. They are a power bloc unto themselves, they would like to think. This is why they have lost credibility. They are mercenaries. The goal of every impoverished Pinoy is to cross over to the other side of the social divide from have-not to have. We have this photo of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao eating with his hands while, on the side of his plate, one could spy gold-plated or even real gold cutlery. His initials “MP” stands for Mamamayan at Panginoon we are told. He believes or his handlers are making him believe, that this is his pathway to the Presidency. Our politicians pander to the poor in every election cycle because they comprise the most number of voters. The poor are agog at the attention paid them for this short span of time. They are used to the routine of their votes being bought during campaign seasons. Any well-meaning politician will start off as an idealist but will eventually be consumed by the system. This is why I am amazed at the effrontery of leftist-militant bohemians such as the cabal of Inday Espina Varona. She praises Erik Matti’s latest cinematic masterpiece On the Job: The Missing 8 but doesn’t see herself in the role that John Arcilla plays as the mouthpiece of political kingpin Manong Pedring Eusebio played by Dante Rivero. We have seen journalists being the grantees of edifying scholarships such as the UK’s Chevening and Canada’s McLuhan but they’re none the better once they are back home to continue in the practice of being paid hacks. This practice shows no signs of abatement as even the millennials are following in the footsteps of their seniors. Just look at the Rapplerettes of Maria Ressa. They are the future of Philippine journalism. Scary, right? While the Aquinos Ninoy, Cory, and Noynoy are resting in peace, Marcos continues to be the bogeyman for the Opposition. Marcos’s flogging is worse than what Mussolini or Qaddafi ever got. Marcos’s memory lives on today because the Opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other Duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of Filipinos. They are no better than the frailes who wanted Filipinos to remain ignorant so they can be manipulated at will. This is what ABS-CBN achieved “in the service of the Filipino people worldwide.” I have gone from an idealist in my youth to a pragmatist as a yuppie as we were then called. The fact is there is no single politician in the country who can claim to be as clean as what the opposition claims the members of their ranks are. This has been the case since time immemorial. The Yellowidiots have never made good on the promises they made while in the process of ousting Marcos in 1986 and they can’t claim the success for it either because credit to that belongs to Juan Ponce Enrile, Gringo Honasan and the US. I’m no Duterte apologist but I can see what he has been able to achieve in his five years in office despite his having to contend with the shrill Opposition. That is a separate achievement in itself. Think of what he could’ve been done if the Opposition cooperated with him for the sake of nation-building. What we have actually seen is the conditioning being done by the opposition on the Filipino people since 1986. The infrastructure Marcos built bears mute testimony to his achievements. This is also true in the case of the “defeated” Vice-Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who continues to rank higher than the “winning” Vice-Presidential candidate Leni Robredo in surveys for the 2022 election. Contrast this with the Opposition whose members, after thirty years in power, can only boast of naming whatever in honor of Ninoy Aquino and the monuments to him throughout the country — an unofficial “hero” whose fifteen minutes of fame was had at the tarmac of the airport now named after him. Pathetic.",1

GetRealPhilippines.com,"""They tossed all semblance of objectivity out the window and took part in the solidarity-in-desperation that characterised Robredo’s campaign particularly in the final weeks leading to the 9th of May."" The Philippines’ mainstream news media is in a death spiral. Many of the country’s top media outfits led by ABS-CBN, Rappler, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and even relatively professional CNN Philippines went for broke in this year’s elections. They bet their entire reputations on the campaign of now-failed Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo. They tossed all semblance of objectivity out the window and took part in the solidarity-in-desperation that characterised Robredo’s campaign particularly in the final weeks leading to the 9th of May. Following all that, the buzzword among the stragglers in the aftermath of the landslide win of administration tandem Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte is “disinformation”. Marcos and Duterte, the losers insist, won on the back of a “disinformation campaign” — one mounted on a “massive” scale, they screech. In essence, the Yellowtards are attempting to gaslight the majority electorate into believing they were victims of a vast conspiracy to mislead them. To make things worse, key personalities employed by the very news organisations that now suffer severe crises of credibility remain unable to reflect on the self-inflicted damage to their priceless reputations seeing that they continue to amplify the baseless assertions of the partisan camps they evidently remain loyal to. So where to for these media organisations who now suffer a colossal loss of face not to mention their place at the top of the pedestal they built for themselves and directed the audience they once monopolised to bow to? The credibility void their folly created is now rapidly being filled by new players — enabled by the very social media platforms they sought to police (an act of hubris that also contributed to further losing the trust of the Filipino people). Mainstream media have to face reality — they need to compete for credibility in today’s hyper-competitive mass communication landscape. If it is the “disinformation” bogey they are worried about, they need to get over that phantom and, instead, focus on proving to an audience who enjoy an abundance of information channels to tune into that theirs is the real deal. Ultimately, however, the public has sole power to decide who is and who isn’t that real deal. No amount of fashioning one’s self to be “official fact checkers” and, believing so, presume to act as Disinformation Police will win back the trust of the public. Only the better brand will. It is now a cliché but there is no denying the reality of the free market of ideas. The alternative is a policed market of the sort that “fact checkers” Maria Ressa of Rappler and Ellen Tordesillas of VERA Files aspire to institute on Facebook. Unfortunately for them Facebook is but one of many options for information dissemination that ordinary people are at liberty to sign up to. To count on policing the Net as being even possible and stubbornly hanging on to that notion is the sort of thing that, in all ironies, loses one precious ground.

In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”."" Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya. Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows. It is no wonder these “journalists” have been utterly discredited. They continue to insult Filipinos with their blatant lies and their presumption to unilaterally crown themselves the foremost “guardians of truth” of the land. Filipinos need to rid their politics of these vermin. What are noble causes and important advocacies are corrupted by dishonest “thought leaders” who use issues of national consequence to disguise an insidious mission to destroy democracy through violent “revolution”. Perhaps they may seem not as threatening as they once were — their “fighters” are more snowflake than guerrilla in appearance and their weapons more Apple than AK-47. If for anything, Filipinos should at least get rid of them because they insult Philippine democracy by suggesting that, despite the hard work of people who work within the legal frame, it is hopelessly broken. Philippine democracy is anything but broken. This is a fact that can be further re-enforced once Filipinos put their collective feet down and take back real activism from the communists and their “woke” Yellowtard allies. “Media practitioners” who belong to leftist-militant media organizations such as Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, and Altermidya are included in the order of battle of the state because they incite sedition. The dishonest perception they aim to spin is that there is suppression of freedom of the press in the country when, in truth, there is none. The fact is, many take for granted the idea that these organisations are “news media” channels when, in reality, they are anything but. They are, when it comes down to it, no more than mere propaganda arms of an obsolete Cold War era “movement” that counts as its singular aim the overthrow through violent “revolution” any legitimately-elected Philippine government. Why must Filipinos continue to put up with these crooks? It looks Filipinos are now getting the answer they’ve long deserved.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""This exercise in releasing 'fact checking' hounds into the social media 'debate' of the Philippines is just another instance of Yellowtard thinking faculties undermining the Opposition cause.""  No matter what they do, the Opposition led by the Liberal Party cannot wash the yellow stain off their Yellowtard brand. Despite many rallies organised and many “reminders” to “wear white” in those rallies, the Opposition will, in the eyes of the majority of Filipinos, remain as Yellow as day-old piss. Branding, after all, is an important aspect in the persuasion industries. Re-branding is a costly marketing endeavour that requires focus and consistency — both of which the Philippine Opposition have consistently demonstrated an utter lack of. And yet the Opposition continue to soldier on (using a loose definition of the term “soldier”) like those AK47-wielding child-soldiers spraying ineffectual automatic fire willy-nilly at crack Army Rangers in the movie Black Hawk Down. This is too bad for Maria Ressa’s Rappler and Ellen Tordesillas’s Vera Files. Both are identified with the Opposition and, as such, are both tainted with this unfortunate colour of the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan. Worse, their latest coup, bagging a “partnership” with social media behemoth Facebook to “fact check” information Filipinos consume on its platform, has become an utter fiasco. Just several days old, the ill-thought-out initiative already draws scorn from a mounting number of Filipinos and sticks another fat pin, this time on the Philippines spot, in the world map printed on the ass of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg already bristling with many such markers. The lack of sense in setting up Yellowtards as arbiters of “truth” on a social media platform is akin to hiring a Filipino to referee one of Manny Pacquiao’s boxing matches. Ressa and Tordesillas, quite simply, cannot be trusted to make judgement calls on what gets visibility — and what gets buried — on users’ newsfeeds. Already, Facebook is under pressure to explain how their mysterious “algorithm” decides what users see and don’t see on their newsfeeds. This latest “fact checking” initiative in the Philippines puts two faces to that “algorithm”. Already a major gaffe on the part of Rappler has all but confirmed the folly in adding more redundant intervention into social media timeline engineering. A recent “fact check” directed at an old report published by Filipino satire site Adobo Chronicles became the latest source of Netizens’ laughs. Adobo Chronicles describes itself as “your best source of up-to-date unbelievable news”. This seems to have escaped the sensibilities of Rapplerette Paige Occeñola who pompously declares… ""Claim: Rappler CEO Maria Ressa has been elected as the president of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP). [NB: hyperlinks to the subject Adobo Chronicles article] Rating: FALSE. Facts: Rappler is not a foreign media outlet and is not a member of FOCAP. Maria Ressa has not been elected as president of the organization."" Occeñola may as well be bragging about lecturing a circus troupe about the impossibility of fitting thirty clowns in a Volkswagen Beetle. In a statement released by about this “fact check” fail, Adobo Chronicles observes… ""Rappler’s fact-check is very self-serving. It used it to defend itself against accusations that it is partly foreign-owned. We call it damage control. But more ironic is the fact that Rappler chose to fact-check a satirical piece. It seems that Maria Ressa and her colleagues at Rappler need to go back to school so they can learn about satire."" More importanly… ""If Rappler can’t even distinguish real news from satire, then what credential does it have to justify its ‘appointment’ as a fact-checker? As one of the followers of Adobo Chronicles said: “How can Rappler defend its own gullibility?” As I suggested in a previous article, perhaps Rappler should focus more on its internal capability to produce good quality journalism before it presumes to “fact check” the world. In so doing, it can learn to compete more and whine less. Only when Rappler learns the ealier and ditches the latter, can Filipinos truly and respectfully welcome it to the jungle that is the Darwinian landscape of today’s social media. Again, and it cannot be emphasised enough, the Philippine Opposition needs to find a way to ditch the Yellowtards and scrub all trace of the yellow stain off its political brand. This exercise in releasing “fact checking” hounds into the social media “debate” of the Philippines is just another instance of Yellowtard thinking faculties undermining the Opposition cause. Filipinos deserve an intelligent Opposition which, needless to say, is a key foundation of an intelligent democracy.",1

August 21, 1983. “Handog ng Pilipino sa mundo…”, “Magkaisa at magsama…”  Yaaawn… OK, change the channel please! Now that the Filipino people have been awakened to the reality that there are better channels to watch on their TV and that the many years of fairy-land “democracy” that Ninoy’s death at the tarmac that fateful day ushered the nation into was nothing but a sham or shall we say – our worst nightmare gone haywire, it’s time to shake off the hangover, rise up to our feet, dust ourselves, and get back full-throttle in the game. Did you see that? Speeding Vietnam is already about to zoom past us. Why “Bury” the Memory of Ninoy The simple answer: Ninoy is NOT a hero. Just look at what Yellow crap Cory democracy brought dumbfounded shortchanged Filipinos: 1. Unbridled senseless local media controlling the minds of star-struck hypnotized zombies. It has programmed all to bow to the fake Yellow Saint-Queen and her “special child” Noynoy. To keep the masses from staging an uprising, the key strategy had been to dumb them down (removing English and education/intellect-oriented programs) with senseless romance entertainment and Tito-Vic-Joey folly (“yumaman kami ng dahil sa katarantaduhan”). 2. The reign of deep-seated pocket-lining corruption and shameless incompetence at all levels of government, all in the guise of decent politically correct bleeding-heart human-rights and rule-of-law-advocating public service. They brought Filipinos to the lowest ebbs of political taste when people became allergic to anything that had to do with intellectualism – considering it an association to dictatorship. 3. A lost three decades of economic and technological advancement. Filipinos have basically given up an important ingredient that turns third-world ghettos into first-world super-states like Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea: discipline. Filipinos have exchanged true greatness (that of character and mind) for “liberty”, taking pride in OFW-remittance-fueled consumerism rather than core engines of intellect-driven growth such as home-grown automotive engineering, semiconductors, railways and rocket science. Toppling Down the Remaining Yellow Pillars The Philippines is finally witnessing the demise of the Yellow political cancer and all that it stands for, as represented by 1. Noynoy Aquino the fallen “prince” who has finally lost immunity and is now facing charges over incompetence that led to the loss of many lives (fallen SAF44), 2. Leni Robredo whose very mandate as VP is crumbling under the weight of Bongbong’s battering-ram charges of obvious election fraud, and 3. Leila De Lima who is now slipping into a dark den where unfed lions await her and the lover-driver, both of which are being subjected to the constant barrage of missiles from Duterte himself in fuming rampaging anti-corruption mode. Well, remember the statue of Lenin that was taken down at the fall of communism/USSR, we as a people must likewise take a symbolic step of denouncing the crap stupidity that we were all fooled into believing in. Mayor Duterte (as he still likes to be called) has just given us the magic formula: it is iron-fisted rule + incorruptibility that can fix this country and get us moving again. We have tried various experiments in the past, and even kept repeating some poisonous concoctions that we already knew would make our nation sick – such as voting in another incompetent Aquino into high office merely on the basis of emotional highs. It is high-time we demolish the reminders of incompetence: such as the idolatrous EDSA shrine and the sickening name of our premiere international gateway. It’s time to topple down the symbols of a dumb and empty ideology that had cast our nation under a long and dark spell. Regaining MIA’s Original Name: Regaining Freedom from Ninoy and Cory’s “Demon-crazy” World There was a point when NLEX was supposed to be changed to “Cory Aquino Expressway”. Now let’s swing the pendulum all the way to the other end by pushing for the change of our national airport’s name back to “Manila International Airport”. We can finally all say goodbye to name that represented our shame: worst airport title and the birthplace of the laglag bala scam. It will be a new era of airport modernization with first-class amenities/comfort rooms (yung wala nang balde at tabo sa tabi), wall-to-wall carpeting for our vital tourists, a train line from the airport to the main MRT-LRT system, and excellent services without the hassles of cumbersome OEC/added-tax requirements for our OFW heroes. Tapos na ang panahon ng kabulokan na dinadala ng malas na pangalang “Ninoy Aquino International Airport”. Malaya na tayo sa kalokohang “demon-crazy”. Let’s get moving from where we left off 30 years ago, when our monument of greatness, the iconic eagle-winged edifice, was called “Manila International Airport”. Pilipinas: It’s your time to fly. Note: The airport was then renamed to Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on August 17, 1987 by virtue of Republic Act No. 6639 under the late president Cory Aquino.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Indeed, ruling Filipinos with an iron fist seems more effective than the softly-softly approach that has been used since Marcos left."" Filipinos do not know what they want. In 1986, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos took to the streets to rally against the late strongman, former President Ferdinand Marcos. The three-day protest eventually led to the ousting of the so-called “dictator” and alleged human rights violator. Twenty five years later, Filipinos from the Mindanao region of Davao are lauding the Duterte family for their style of leadership that is reminiscent of the Marcos years. They love the Duterte Mayors particularly former Mayor who is now the Vice Mayor to his daughter Sara, gun-toting Rodrigo for their Wild-West-style no-nonsense leadership. Most Filipinos from Davao or the Davaoeños are quite aware of the hired mercenaries — what they dub the “Davao Death Squads” (DDS) — and are even proud to say that the phantom team is largely responsible for keeping the peace and the order in their beloved city. They say that since the people cannot rely on the justice system, these death squads at least keep the criminals off the streets, which in turn makes it safer for regular people to walk about. Full disclosure: these are all based on anecdotal statements and not on an official study. Most vocal Davaoeños would readily admit that the improvised system works for them. One commentator even asked the question, “If an iron-fisted Machiavellian approach is preferable to enforce peace & order, are you saying that [we were] better off not having the Edsa revolution in the first place?” Indeed, ruling Filipinos with an iron fist seems more effective than the softly-softly approach that has been used since Marcos left. I even received a lot of hostility from Duterte supporters for my article criticizing Mayor Sara’s use of violence to get her way. So, I thought, hmmm…there must be something that people from other regions in the Philippines are missing… The evidence, in fact, seems to speaks for itself. The Department of Tourism awarded Davao the distinction of being the “Most Livable City in the Philippines in 2008” and, according to reports, the Foreign Direct Investment Magazine had even highlighted Davao as “the 10th Asian City of the Future”. The importance of Davao as a regional trade hub is highlighted by its transport infrastructure. Davao’s airport is the busiest in Mindanao, and the city also boasts two government and nine private seaports. Construction of more roads and bridges is underway according to their website. Now that is something to think about. As the fifth largest city in the Philippines, Davao’s economy has grown steadily in the last two decades. There is no shortage of investors in the city of 1.5 million and most people there attribute all this to the efforts of their beloved mayor whose efforts at cleaning up the city and introducing economic reforms, which include dismantling of protection for “infant industries” and the breakdown of industries with monopolistic or cartel tendencies, seem to have paid off. It’s been said that Davao contributed significantly to making the Philippines the world’s top exporter of papaya, mangosteen, and even flowers. The annual income of Davao City in 2010 is said to have reached 4 billion pesos, the richest city in the country outside of Metro Manila.  So I now wonder: wouldn’t the rest of the Philippines be better off electing Rodrigo Duterte clones to their respective local governments to effect the same level of discipline we see in Davao? Just imagine if the image and likeness of “the man” together with his brand of “leadership” is put in place in every city in the country. The result might see the entire country being more than eligible for “The Most Livable Place on Earth” award. That scenario would be just short of amazing. I guess all that is needed is for us to turn a blind eye to the activities of the hired mercenaries, which if the rumor is true, goes hand in hand with a Duterte-styled management. And if one commentator (an avid Duterte supporter) is correct, for as long as you are not a drug pusher or do not engage in criminal activities, you can be assured that you won’t get any visits from any “death squad” any time soon. In short, if we take the word of a Davaoeño who has for some time enjoyed relative peace and order, it’s all good. Apparently, even the human rights advocates have not been very vocal about their complaints either. Who wouldn’t want a curfew on minors observed in the city? Under the Duterte rule, all business establishments, in particular bars and discos, would be mandated by a city ordinance to refrain from selling alcoholic drinks beyond 2:00 am. That would certainly reduce the number of casualties that result from public brawls and drink driving accidents.The roads would be a lot safer too because motorists will be forced to observe road rules and regulations. Regular checkpoints in key parts of City and at the city boundaries will be in place round the clock to ensure strict implementation of traffic rules. And just like in Davao, motorcycle drivers with no helmets and motorists with defective lights will not be allowed to enter or drive in any city in Luzon and the Visayas.The use of fireworks and other pyrotechnics, as well as smoking, would be strictly prohibited in the entire country. We will have more people with complete sets of fingers if illegal fireworks traditionally lit on New Year’s Eve are banned. Smoking will be banned too — even outdoors, if you are under a roof of any kind. Violators will be made to pay hefty fines, perform community service, serve jail time, or a combination of the three. President Noynoy Aquino will most likely be forced to quit smoking. And while we are at it, we can extend similar penalties to people who love singing in the wee hours of the morning. But this will be the most shocking rule for all Filipinos in Luzon and Visayas: Littering would be prohibited. I don’t know how Filipinos would be able to adjust to this. The death squad will be likely to have their hands full implementing this rule alone considering how most Filipinos can’t seem to kick their tossing habit. There will definitely be a mother of a withdrawal period as Filipinos quit cold turkey throwing their trash wherever they please.Just think about it. For almost three decades, Filipinos have enjoyed their so-called freedom to lay waste over the entire country. Isn’t it time that someone with an iron fist instill discipline on all of us? Or are individual rights and civil liberties more important than a clean and safe environment? You decide what you want.",1

Perhaps they could start with reevaluating the role the three daughters, Tricia, Aika, and Jillian play in this ill-fated endeavour."" The words “let me educate you” may not have explicitly been uttered by “vice presidential” daughter (and confirmed woman) Jillian Robredo. However they may as well have. Robredo can be seen strutting around the Baguio City Market surrounded by an enormous entourage the members of which snapped photos at every opportunity as she stopped and stooped to shake hands with whoever gave her a second look. The spectacle had elitist written all over it and it is an exhibit of a lesson the Yellowtard camp led by Robredo’s mother have yet to learn with just a couple of weeks left in the campaign. Small surprise then that a local, reportedly an Igorot woman, heckled her. Word on the street is that she scolded Robredo and her entourage for blocking the way in the crowded market. Interestingly, the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media community which would normally jump at every story surrounding the Yellowtard campaign only had this to “report” more than 12 hours after the incident… ""‘FOCUS TAYO’ After a heckling incident in Baguio City, Jillian Robredo, the youngest daughter of presidential bet VP Leni Robredo, remained focused and will continue doing house-to-house campaigning for her mother. “Love you, bunso,” Dr. Tricia Robredo replied in her tweet.""  The embattled Yellowtard campaign of leading Opposition candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo had been largely unsuccessful at shedding its elitist skin over months of the campaign period of these elections. This most recent incident is yet another setback to their “cause”. A statement had since been reportedly issued by the Benguet chapter of the Robredo People’s Council. What does Leni Robredo have to do to fix what is clearly a liability to her campaign efforts? Perhaps they could start with reevaluating the role the three daughters, Tricia, Aika, and Jillian play in this ill-fated endeavour.

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The Poor are that other god traditional politicians prostate themselves to whenever the bells of the Church of Philippine Elections start tolling. Leni Robredo is indeed that quintessential saint of traditional Philippine politics and Winnie Monsod is her prophet."" A common defensive argument routinely issued by Leni Robredo’s Yellowtard supporters is that the “vice president” is “not corrupt”. Yes indeed, she is not that among many other things that she is not. That does not mean she will be a good leader, of course. In fact, there really is not much her camp is claiming that she is other than one who “helps the poor” which, come to think of it, any other politician and his dog claims to also be. Consider that the late former President Noynoy Aquino also run on a similar bullshit platform, that he is the Son of Filipino Political Gods and, as such, a virtual saint who “helps the poor” and regards them as his “boss”. He too was, Yellowtard logic dictates, “not corrupt”. Indeed, the tagline of his administration was “Kung walang kurap walang mahirap” (“If there is nobody corrupt then there is nobody poor”). Apart from being a nice rhyme, the statement makes no sense considering a lack of corruption does not necessarily cause a lack of poverty. The dishonesty in the Yellowtard rhetoric notwithstanding, Aquino went on to win the 2010 election anyway. Unfortunately for Filipinos, he presided over one of the most corrupt administrations on record. Erupting under his watch was an enormous pork barrel scandal to the tune of billions and billions of pesos disappearing into the shady pet “projects” of a who’s-who of members of Congress and their henchmen in various non-government organisations (NGOs). Aquino’s sidekick, then Budget Secretary Butch Abad engineered much of the accounting slights of hand that enabled these crooked appropriations. Did heads roll as a result? Nada. Thus one could now appreciate just how tone-deaf Leni Robredo’s I-Am-Not-Corrupt rhetoric is. Tone-deaf because it deliberately ignores the billions of pesos lost to the Yellowtard Era’s pork barrel excesses and tone-deaf because they now laughably use it as campaign fodder again — basically demonstrating the small regard they have for Filipino voters’ intellectual faculties. Would Filipinos still elect someone whose campaign platform is built almost entirely around not being corrupt? Yellowtard “economist” Winnie Monsod thinks so… ""But a Leni presidency would be a game-changer. They would have no hold over her—because money has never gotten to her head. Nine years in politics, and still no splashy cars, no large houses, no jewelry, and still taking public transport (!). No potential lines to get to her—her husband (Jesse Robredo would have made an excellent president as well) is dead, her three girls hate politics and drugs."" One cannot really call that drivel bullshit because it is just so downright corny. Oh wait, we left out one other thing Monsod writes that describes that other pillar of Yellowtard corniness; ""Moreover, she is the only candidate with hands-on experience working with the poor, the marginalized."" All hail “The Poor”. The Poor are that other god traditional politicians prostate themselves to whenever the bells of the Church of Philippine Elections start tolling. Leni Robredo is indeed that quintessential saint of traditional Philippine politics and Winnie Monsod is her prophet. Aren’t we all just so sick of politicians who “help the poor”? It looks like we actually finally are sick of that crock. Despite all Yellowtardom’s choir of angels singing praises to the “plight” of “The Poor”, they still fail to get their Madre a decent ranking in the popularity polls. The fact is, the Philippines’ prosperous future is not hinged on “The Poor” getting their ayuda-funded three meals a day. Prosperity will be built on the backs of the country’s best, brightest, most promising, most intelligent, best-fed, best-educated, and most affluent and enterprising citizens. We talk about capital investment — whether foreign or domestic in origin — being the key input into a growing and strengthening economy. Well guess what: capital does not come from the blood and sweat of labourers and the whining of mendicants and their communist champions. It comes from the economic product of entrepreneurs, innovative and creative people, scientists, engineers, and artists — people who are worth investing in and supporting. Being “not corrupt” and “helpful” to “The Poor” does not make one the sort of leader who will lead a promising people to greatness. To promise — and desperately argue — that one is “not corrupt” and “helps the poor” is a downright dishonest way to pitch one’s self to Filipino voters as their future leader.",1

As poll after poll conducted by reputable survey firms over the last several years confirm beyond reasonable doubt the dismal voter base of of Opposition “leader” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo, the question of her role in the alleged electoral fraud that marred the 2016 election comes back to bite. What happened in 2016 remains shrouded in mystery. Short of conspiring with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to cover up many instances of suspicious circumstances that surrounded the tallying and counting of election returns back then, Robredo was at least a potential beneficiary of said fraud if it did occur. Most telling is the flight to the United States — in the midst of the controversy — of no less than the COMELEC chairman at the time, Andy Bautista. How he managed to leave the country and, to this day, manage to fly under the radar of public and media scrutiny leads many to speculate that the conspiracy to whitewash the stink of electoral fraud that may have occurred in the 2016 elections transcends partisan camps — from President Rodrigo Duterte’s own seeming ambivalence to electoral reform and under whose watch Bautista managed to escape to the US to the Liberal Party and today’s Opposition keeping mum on the matter. Manila Times columnist Antonio Contreras back in 2019 wrote in his piece “Again, where is Andy Bautista?”… ""Until now, it is not entirely clear how the State could allow Andy Bautista to just roam around in comfortable self-exile, when there is compelling evidence that the election process that he presided over was full of anomalies. And it is not just about straight lines of otherwise random votes, or of abnormally high percentage of undervotes which would have already sounded the alarm bell to any election scientist. We are talking here about actual evidence that points to tampering not only with the results but also with the process itself. Election fraud whistleblower Glenn Chong presented to the public a procession of damning empirical data that screamed at the need for validation through a serious investigation, and which could no longer simply rely on the denials by Comelec officials. Vote counting machines that have already been tested and sealed were already transmitting a day before the elections. An illegal fourth server was established and has not been vetted properly, even as the source codes were not properly vetted according to procedures prescribed by law. Shading thresholds of ballots were unilaterally changed by Comelec without informing the parties. Scanned ballot images are missing, or were apparently tampered with, causing the sequence number to exceed the total number of ballots cast. Signatures of those who voted did not match those who are registered. Ballot boxes were deliberately opened and tampered with, some drenched not only with water but with chemicals, and others stuffed with dirt, which was but apropos to the fact that our elections have been dirtied by fraud."" Fast forward to today. It is under the harsh light of these unresolved allegations of electoral fraud that blights 2016 that the mystery of how Leni Robredo, who supposedly beat rival Bongbong Marcos to the vice presidency then, could possibly trail the latter by such an enormous margin in poll after poll baffles so many. Where is that voter base today that could at least lend some semblance of credibility to her supposed victory over Marcos in 2016? Where are those supporters who supposedly voted for Leni Robredo in 2016? Do they even exist? Such is the enormous burden of proof that rests on Robredo’s shoulders today. No less than Opposition “social news network” Rappler itself “reports” that “Leni Robredo says defeating the dictator’s son in the 2022 presidential race will put to rest his lie that she cheated him in the 2016 vice presidential contest”. Indeed, this is further proof that Bongbong Marcos is a key pillar of Robredo’s campaign and that without him, Robredo’s bid for the presidency literally has not a leg to stand on as she herself admits that she has to beat him to clear this whole mess up. ""“Kailangan talagang talunin siya sa susunod na eleksyon para once and for all, mahinto na yung ginagawa niya na pagpapapaniwala sa tao nung narrative na gusto niyang i-push,” Robredo went on. (He has to be defeated in the coming elections so that once and for all, his narrative [that he was cheated in the 2016 vice presidential race] that he is pushing will stop.)"" Perhaps then it is time Robredo be queried on what she really knows about why Andy Bautista managed to escape to the US, remains at large, and is a subject matter that seems to be a no-go-zone for her allies in Big Corporate Media. What really happened in 2016 and what accounts for the discrepancy between Robredo’s apparent performance in the 2016 elections and her dismal preference ratings today? The mystery persists.",1

To be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman’s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned."" The only thing Opposition partisans can say about ABS-CBN personality Boy Abunda’s interview of Leni Robredo is that he “interrupted her a lot”. That’s actually not true. Abunda was constantly trying to steer Robredo back on topic and, in most cases, reiterating the question of the segment. The trouble with Leni Robredo is that she was too reactive to Abunda’s questions which were evidently designed to test the breadth and depth of context that his interviewee would be able to apply in his or her response. An example of Robredo falling into this trap is her responses to Abunda’s questions on how to pay the national debt. In reality, no one president can “pay” the national debt. It can, under his or her watch within his or her term, be serviced and managed to certain economic and fiscal parameters. This is part of the day job of the Secretary of Finance. Rather than stammer through a lame attempt to answer what was clearly a trick question, Robredo could have simply responded by saying the above — that debt servicing be kept reasonable, that debt levels be managed within the frame of forecast economic performance, and that she will work closely with her economic and fiscal managers to achieve these debt management goals. Easy, right? The most awkward segment of the interview — one that Robredo visibly struggled with and where the profound inconsistency of the ideological underpinnings of her campaign became apparent — was Abunda’s question on abortion. Abortion is a cornerstone of the feminist movement. Feminists are big on this whole “my body my choice” thing. Considering that Robredo’s “pink” campaign theme panders to the feminist community, it is clear that she is allowing her personal Catholic faith to cloud her judgment. Indeed, Robredo’s revelation that she consults a lot with Catholic priests is a red flag. Catholic priesthood is Western civilisation’s most ancient boys’ club. To be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman’s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned. This is the whole trouble with the Yellowtards. They claim to be liberal and presume to be chummy with the gay community and the feminist movement. However, the Yellowtards’ top leaders are also outwardly prayerful and schmooze a lot with Catholic bishops and priests. The Roman Catholic Church is clear on its position with regard to homosexuality and the sorts of liberal lifestyles and pro-choice philosophies espoused by the gay and feminist communities. All of these run counter to Catholic dogma which is deeply incompatible with liberalism. Robredo herself admitted in the interview that she finds herself “conflicted” by all this. This is disturbing considering that the Philippines aspires to join the ranks of modern liberal democracies that host societies where tolerance for diversity of lifestyles and life choices is paramount. The Roman Catholic faith is not compatible with this aspiration and Robredo, being a professed devout Catholic cannot claim to be an authentic liberal in this regard. Fish are caught by the mouth and Robredo had bitten the proverbial hook and was effectively reeled in out of her depth and found herself gasping for oxygen. Perhaps her Yellowtard followers should, instead, be thanking Boy Abunda for interrupting her frequently. If he didn’t, Robredo could have made an even bigger fool of herself and damaged further her already floundering campaign.",1

Leni Robredo today issued a statement asserting that she regards herself as a “healing leader”. Exactly what this means is anyone’s guess but what seems to escape the blinkered minds of her supporters is how it was really her Yellowtard lot who drove through the wedge that today deeply-divides Philippine society. The divisiveness the Yellowtard “cause” is manifested in their habitual use of colours to define their exclusive community of “woke” partisans. A political colour is meant to invoke exclusive tribalism rather than come across as a call to be inclusive. One feels this when seeing the pompous and self-righteous manner with which members of Robredo’s mob signal their party affiliations by bathing their campaign events and social media paraphernalia in pink today. Indeed, the use of this new pink branding seems to actually have the unintended effect of highlighting even more their lame attempt to distance themselves from their Yellowtard roots. It is worth noting too that former President Noynoy Aquino himself spent the bigger part of his term identifying himself with the Yellowtard brand. He showed his being a Yellowtard first and a Filipino a distant second whenever he made public appearances sporting a yellow ribbon pinned to his shirt or suit. This made it easy for then rising candidate Rodrigo Duterte to demonstrate his loyalty to all Filipinos first — by using the national colours to define his campaign. Evidently not having learnt enough from that loss in 2016 and then again in 2019 when the entire Yellowtard “Otso Diretso” coalition endorsed by no less than Robredo herself was wiped out at the polls, the Opposition have latched on to this very same campaign style. The same coloured stunts and spectacles, the same self-righteous campaign style, and the same negative rhetoric is on exhibit. It seems the Yellowtards are really not serious about winning the 2022 elections. How could they be when they’ve chosen a loser politician like Leni Robredo to lead them? What is it exactly that Leni Robredo plans to achieve if given the chance to lead the country from 2022? If Robredo and her lot cannot even change their campaign style what makes them think they would know the first thing about mounting an effort to implement long overdue change in the Philippines? Robredo cannot even seem to make a basic promise to make the Philippines a better place if given the chance to serve as its president. A “healing leader” she now tells us? What results does that drivel even imply? What does success even look like following a Robredo presidency? The mystery persists.",1

Can anyone actually imagine “vice president” Leni Robredo sitting in front of another head of state discussing serious matters of global consequence? It becomes even harder to imagine after watching her speak in yet another one of her pabebe tirades before her adoring minions in the media. Check out this video of her carrying on about the sore boot mark President Rodrigo Duterte planted on her rear end last weekend.  Yeah… Taglish pa more, Leni Robredo! One wonders how her chi-chi fans from the Ateneo can even stand hearing her speak without getting their Manglapusian sensibilities offended. Robredo may get away with her colegiala accent but, if one is able to look past that, it is evident she simply cannot stitch a full English sentence together. Now that shortcoming simply cannot pass the Ateneo standard of excellence in the communication arts, folks. Then again, are Ateneans willing to overlook that and embrace the pedestrian manner of speaking Robredo seems to be comfy with? There are bigger questions that this last small question raise. Put aside for a moment the electoral fraud allegations that put into question her legitimate claim to the office of the Vice President. Robredo being “vice president” (for now) is just a heartbeat away from the Philippine presidency. Imagine for a moment what it would be like having a president that talks the way she does — perpetually like a schoolgirl making sumbong to her titas in ABS-CBN while making tusok-tusok the fishballs. I don’t think Vladimir Putin would be impressed. More important than her language skills is the question of whether or not she actually possesses the chops to elevate her discourse. It is difficult to find evidence that she could actually step back from her petty telegenic dramas and talk about the big issues from a plane of thinking a bit higher than the couple of notches above Kris Aquino-speak her level of discourse is currently situated. And still we wonder why the Philippines currently suffers from a particularly sticky form of intellectual bankruptcy. Right there before us in “vice president” Leni Robredo is the encapsulation of the root of this acute collective intellectual deficit that crushes any hope that the Philippines will be a world-class country in the near- to mid-term future.",1

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""...the shape-shifter style with which Leni Robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the 2016 elections to the present has got PR written all over it."" If there is something current “vice president” Leni Robredo has so far proven, it is that she is a good performer. Her most recent PR stunt in which she delivered her “recommendations” on ways to improve the “fight” versus the coronavirus came across as a pretty competent stage act that left her fans gushing. Unfortunately, all it really proved is that Robredo can read but not necessarily lead. After all, she went into what seemed to be the finer details around “restarting the economy”, “budget utilisation”, and “reporting of data” — fields of expertise that clearly go way beyond her known expertise in the fields of “human rights” lawyering. Indeed, considering that she delves into fields that vex even the most competent of administrators in these times of COVID-19 pandemic, it seems pretty premature or too much of a jumping-of-the-gun to be praising evidently scripted words coming from a “vice president” who could barely string together a sentence in straight English. In mounting these quaint stunts, Robredo plays into an easy — even exploitative — space. Filipinos are renowned for their inability to tell the difference between the fictious character played by an actor on TV and in the movies and the actual real-life character of said actor. This is the reason many actors make it big in Philippine politics. Look no further than the likes of Senators Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla, among others, not to mention Joseph “Erap” Estrada who actually bagged the presidency in 1998 and Fernando “Ang Panday” Poe Jr who came disturbingly close to achieving the same in 2004. As such, the manner with which even the top Opposition “thought leaders” latch on to someone like Robredo who has no proven track record in executive leadership nor, at the very least, administration comes across as a bit daft. Reading off a script certainly does not prove much. For that matter, the shape-shifter style with which Robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the 2016 elections to the present has got PR written all over it. When one does not have a stable political platform upon which to deliver one’s messaging to one’s constituents and, instead, relies on prompts from PR consultants, one tends to simply bob up and down on a sea of public opinion and, as such, come across as pathetically inconsistent. There is a place for PR-driven public messaging and that is during election campaigns. Robredo has obviously not matured beyond the same campaign-mode her rabidly partisan followers seem to expect her to sustain. This is not appropriate given that she has been warming the “vice president” seat for the past four years now and is part of the government she presumably contributes her ideas to. If her supporters see the media stunt-like manner with which Robredo trumpets her “recommendations” as a successful indictment of the Philippine government’s efforts to do its job, she is on the hook to correct that perception if one assumes that she delivers these recommendations not to make her government look bad but to genuinely contribute to its success. The question to Robredo therefore is, what is the real intent of her delivering her recommendations to the media first rather than to her own government in the first instance? The answer to that question is what will ultimately be the real test of whether Leni Robredo is fit to lead the Filipino people. Evidently being able to read alone just doesn’t cut it.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""In Leni Robredo's efforts to bring down the the Duterte government, she is inadvertently bringing down the entire country. The consequences of her actions would be devastating to Filipinos who have suffered instability for decades..."" Is current Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo one of the dumbest politicians in the Philippines today? With her recent actions, it seems like it. Robredo has decided to go on a full head-on collision course against her President Rodrigo Duterte – someone she is supposed to serve as part of her mandate. In a pre-recorded video meant for the 60th annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, Austria, Robredo addressed her “concerns” about Duterte’s war on drugs: ""We are now looking at some very grim statistics: since July last year, more than 7,000 people have been killed in summary executions.” and """"“Some of those who have told us that when there’s crime, they normally go to the police. Now, they don’t know where to turn. Our people feel both hopeless and helpless—a state of mind that we must all take seriously,” she said."" The problem with Robredo is she reported unverified claims against Duterte and the Philippine National Police to the international community, specifically the United Nations, without backing them up with data from the law enforcement agency. For someone who is advocating against “fake news”, Robredo made serious allegations based on hearsay. She’s being inconsistent and a hypocrite as usual. It’s like she’s not a lawyer. She has pissed off the Philippine National Police by painting them in a bad light. She didn’t even ask them for clarification about their scheme “palit-ulo”, which is “a commitment of a drug suspect to provide assistance in the arrest of a ‘bigger fish’ in the illegal drug syndicate.” Robredo’s action is despicable. It is tantamount to treason. In her efforts to bring down the the Duterte government, she is inadvertently bringing down the entire country. The consequences of her actions would be devastating to Filipinos who have suffered instability for decades as a result of destabilisation efforts by the Liberal Party and their allies. Robredo doesn’t care about respecting Philippine institutions and upholding the rule of law despite calling for it in her statements to the UN. If she did, she wouldn’t ask for international intervention in dealing with local issues. And Robredo advocating for rule of law is quite laughable considering she allegedly benefited from electoral fraud. She seems desperate lately because there is a strong probability that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal could decide on her fate soon – a decision that might not be favourable to her once it is proven that she benefited from electoral fraud. Robredo’s actions could be her way of getting back at Duterte for firing her from her cabinet post. She may want to avenge her loss of face by destroying Duterte in the eyes of the international community. It doesn’t seem to matter to her if the rest of the Philippine population gets dragged down too. Her latest antics prove that she is not very smart. She doesn’t know how to play politics discretely. She is blatant in undermining her rival. Her style quite often backfires though. She must be the most hated politician in the Philippines today, second only to Senator Leila De Lima. Just because Robredo is not part of the Duterte government anymore and is not included in cabinet meetings doesn’t mean she has to direct her questions to the outside world. While Robredo comes across as an airhead, Filipinos should not underestimate the people feeding her head with material to say to the international media. A lot of members of the international media still think she has credibility, unfortunately. This has a lot to do with their own bias against Duterte. They will believe whoever says what they want to hear and if Robredo says the things they want to hear; she will be their “credible source”. These meddlers need to be put in their place and told to butt out of affairs they do not understand. Robredo overestimates her ability to lead 100+ million Filipinos. She can’t even offer alternative solutions to the problems the Philippines is facing today. How is she going to face-off with drug lords with her tweetums style? Her charm would only be good for selling coffins – something only people need when they are dead. She’ll probably bring back “Daang Matuwid”. She keeps emphasizing that Duterte should focus on poverty alleviation instead of fighting criminality. She’s too stupid to understand that reducing crime is good for investors who can provide employment and alleviate poverty. A VP trying to undermine her President doesn’t look good at all. It just makes her look like she wants to replace Duterte. Self-serving. Robredo is acting like a traitor. It’s as simple as that. She should step down as soon as possible. The problem is she neither has the brain nor conscience to do so. She is so power hungry. She doesn’t care if the Philippines’ reputation gets tainted even further as long as she achieves her goal of being President. She’s digging her own grave. Now that is dumb.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Her 'Lugaw Leni' persona which was one of her longest-running brand awareness campaigns (launched during her 'response' to the Taal volcano eruption in early 2020) evidently did the most damage."" Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao shared in a Facebook post yesterday what he later writes in his column today “Isko, Leni studies confirm Marcos Jr. is way ahead” is a report on a focus group study commissioned by the campaign team of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo. The full slide deck of the report is available on Tiglao’s FB post and it provides really detailed insight into what is behind Robredo’s failure to launch and what fuels her rival presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos’s stellar resonance with a large chunk of the voting public. In three points, the study researchers clearly outlined the objectives of these focus groups which they conducted with “Class D and E” registered voters of Metro Manila aged 20 to 40 years old, who are “committed and soft voters” of Bongbong Marcos: (1) To understand [the] journey on how and why they [came to] support Ferdinand Marcos Jr. (BBM) (2) To see what arguments could possibly diminish or erase their support for BBM (3) To test their openness to supporting Vice-President Leni Robredo The insights gleaned by the researchers paint an unsurprising picture of what Robredo’s campaign strategists are up against in terms of changing perceptions — both of Marcos and of Robredo — among Marcos’s supporters and crafting a way forward to achieve this. The following slides from the report summarises key terms used by focus group participants that were noted by researchers.Most notable are the negative terms associated with Robredo that are clear indictments of the dysfunctional messaging that characterised her campaign over the last six to eight months and the PR stunts she engaged in over the five years of her term as “vice president”. Her “Lugaw Leni” persona which was one of her longest-running brand awareness campaigns (launched during her “response” to the Taal volcano eruption in early 2020) evidently did the most damage. Amazingly, this piece of collateral persisted into her current “KakamPink” campaign where serving lugaw (rice porridge) to supporters remains a cornerstone activity of her sorties. Coming in second in the list of failed Robredo personal brand development initiatives is her legacy as a minion — no, leader — of the utterly-discredited Liberal Party of the Philippines. Robredo ran as the LP vice presidential candidate in 2016 and, also under the LP flag, endorsed the ill-fated Otso Diretso senatorial coalition in 2019. Despite sad efforts at recolouring her brand to the Pink of her campaign today, Robredo remains, at her core, a Yellowtard. We wrote back then amidst the fallout in the aftermath of this catastrophic stunt… ""Some Yellowtard partisans and “activists” expressed dismay over how these stunts may actually be setting back the “cause” and bringing across the wrong message to voters whose preferences they seek to convert to their camp."" The research shows that the majority of the work the Yellowtards need to do over the remaining campaign period is to undo and correct the damage caused by their own work. Can they do this in the less than five months before Election Day? The report provides some food for thought on the way forward…  While people feel [Bongbong Marcos] is as brilliant as his father, it is not actually the case If there is a need to harp on martial law, it should come from someone credible and who experienced it firsthand [Leni Robredo] might need to refrain from voicing her opinion against BBM as it only makes him more ‘kawawa’ and gain public sympathy Nonetheless, the researchers go on to spell out some “viable methods to attack BBM”. Given that they now have a treasure trove of “research” on how to beat Bongbong Marcos the steps they will take next and the shrill internal conversations that will erupt within Yellowtard echo chambers will be an interesting show to sit back and watch over a couple of beers.

Any celebrity will do even if irrational. The damage being wrought by the Yellows on Philippine society continues because they still encourage Filipinos to seek wisdom from showbiz personalities — a habit that has resulted in a profound intellectual bankruptcy that now grips Philippine society. A recent tweet by “Asia’s Songbird” Regine Velasquez, for example, is now being put up as a rallying point to mobilise support for the flagging hopes for a victory in this year’s elections of the Opposition coalition Otso Diretso. Indeed, quick to chime in on the celebrity “thought leadership” craze now rippling across Yellowtardom is no less than “vice president” Leni Robredo herself who reportedly “lauded entertainers for speaking up on national issues, such as the territorial dispute in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).”  “I’m inspired that there are celebrities who have the courage,” Robredo said in Filipino. “It’s not easy for those who find the courage to speak up because they’re vulnerable to attack. These people are brave for saying what’s on their mind.” Not only does Robredo contribute to the dumbing down of an entire society by anointing showbiz personalities as its foremost gurus, she sets an astonishingly low bar with regard to notions of what constitutes being “brave”.

If I were in her shoes, I would stay quiet lest I get forced to eat humble pie..."" Presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo keeps insisting that she has legitimate claim to the office because it was proclaimed so by Congress. However, the on-going electoral protest being mounted by former Senator Bongbong Marcos casts doubt on all that. More importantly, now that the Supreme Court is involved as arbiter in that protest, only that court holds authority on the matter. As long as the investigation is ongoing, no one else but the court has final say. Another mystery persists as well. If there was no cheating, why is former COMELEC Chairman Andy Bautista allegedly in possession of hidden wealth? Even his wife Patricia Bautista didn’t know about it. And why is he hiding in the US? Before he left for overseas, he went to visit then newly-proclaimed President Rodrigo Duterte in Malacanang. He confided something and then went away for good. It is interesting in that light that Duterte himself has since remained silent on the matter. Did Bautista strike some sort of secret deal with Duterte to secure his freedom and unhindered passage to the US? Leni Robredo keeps insisting she won even though the recount of votes is still continuing. She is not humble at all. If I were in her shoes, I would stay quiet lest I get forced to eat humble pie if the decision is against me. But we can’t expect Robredo to have any such foresight. Robredo is exhibiting on the outside the opposite of what is likely a growing insecurity on the inside. She is duty bound as a top officer of the Philippine Government to respect the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Evidently, however, she or, more likely, the community of hangers-on that orbit her office have much to lose. Robredo is the only hook the Yellow camp have onto the corridors of power after their catastrophic loss in this year’s mid-term elections. “Funny that accusation of stealing would come from Bongbong Marcos” – Leni Robredo No, what’s funny is Robredo thinks people are stupid enough to think the Liberal Party are incapable of cheating the election results.",1

All that remains debatable because the COMELEC had left many questions unresolved...""  If I were Leni Robredo, I wouldn’t be reminding people of what happened back in 2016 when allegations of electoral fraud marred what was supposed to be an “important” national election. In arrogantly proclaiming that she handily beat rival candidate Bongbong Marcos for the vice presidency back then, old wounds have been opened including those to do with the persistent mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Andy Bautista who was Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman at the time. ""“Ako, it doesn’t make sense. Kung gusto namin siya ipa-disqualify dapat sana no’ng laban pa namin ng VP,” Robredo told reporters in a press conference in Negros Occidental on Friday. “Saka kung ang purpose ng disqualification para maalis siya sa contest na ito, hindi naman kailangan. Naglaban na kami no’ng 2016, nanalo naman kami na walang ganyan,” she added."" Perhaps it might not have occurred to Robredo that her camp, the Liberal Party (LP), at the time were not as clued in on just how formidable an opponent they were up against — which is why a desperate stunt like disqualifying an opponent (such as what is being attempted today) was not in the cards early in the campaign. Indeed, many observers looked back at how desperation on the part of the Yellowtards kicked in late into the campaign as then candidate Rodrigo Duterte pulled far ahead of LP bet Mar Roxas at the eleventh hour. With just hours to go and the presidency all but lost to Duterte, Robredo became the Hail Mary Pass that needed to deliver a score for the Yellowtards. Many observers are convinced that the designated wide receiver in those final hours of the election was the then COMELEC chair who, it seems, went on to deliver on his assignment paving the way for Robredo’s self-proclaimed “win”. As the story goes, that successful delivery came at a cost and so now, the mystery persists: Where is Andy Bautista? Did Robredo know what may have been going on behind the scenes back then? That too is a mystery. Just hours after the shocking statistical improbabilities that accompanied the VP count (a seeming “neck-and-neck race”) were picked up by keen watchers, Robredo joined the rest of her LP ilk in parroting what came across as a prepared script wrought in the midst of what looked like an orchestrated ruling out of any possibility of fraud. Never mind that authorities — presumably led by the COMELEC — are duty-bound to investigate all allegations. Never mind that there was no basis on such short notice to rule out the possibility of fraud. Never mind that Smartmatic personnel implicated in the allegations were mysteriously allowed to leave the Philippines. Did Leni Robredo actually win the vice presidency in 2016? Is she the Philippines’ rightful VP today? All that remains debatable because the COMELEC had left many questions unresolved, had tainted evidence pertinent to the case, and may have been complicit in allowing Bautista who had, by then, become a person of interest in the case to leave the country. In short, the case remains open today as far as millions of Filipinos are concerned. Robredo may have been proclaimed VP by a Filipino judge, but so have many other top officials under similarly dubious circumstances in the past following unlawful spectacles commonly associated with the Yellowtard “people power” narrative: Cory Aquino proclaimed “president” after the 1986 EDSA coup d’etat, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo after the “EDSA II” lynching of Joseph “Erap” Estrada. Anything can be made “legal” in the Philippines if a big enough mob of cherry-picked participants gives the thumbs-up and a Philippine judge can be suckered into being an accessory to the fraud that follows. Aren’t we all glad Leni Robredo is around to remind us of these things?",1

She ran under the LP banner, took to the campaign trail with Roxas and Aquino, wore the LP’s yellow colours, and sang from the same Daang Matuwid hymn book."" At the centre of all the chatter surrounding the ascent of Leni Robredo to the office of the Vice President of the Philippines lies the question: What will be her role in the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte? The future does not look too bright for the presumptive “vice president”. Putting aside the allegations of electoral fraud and the non-compliance of the Liberal Party to Commission on Election (COMELEC) rules around the submission of the party Statement of Contributions and Expenditure (SOCE) that cloud the office of the Vice President, there is little Robredo has to offer that would be of interest to Duterte. Robredo, by her own doing, has pretty much locked herself outside of the soon-to-be-President’s circle of trust. During the campaign, Robredo had all but shot herself on the foot by by issuing evidently ill-thought-out statements that run counter to Duterte’s envisioned approach to straightening out the Philippines. Duterte, if we recall, rose to power on the back of a promise to apply more, shall we say, iron-fisted means to crack down hard on rampant criminality in the country. To that, Robredo has reportedly vowed to “lead the fight against [Duterte]” on that front. She goes further to assert… ""“For me, it’s going to be a huge challenge [to work with Duterte],” she admitted in an interview at the tomb of her late husband, former interior secretary Jesse Robredo, where she paid her respects before voting. “As a general rule, I think the vice president should be supportive of the President in spite of party differences. It’s your obligation to the people to work together. But there are some things that can’t be compromised. [Human rights] is one of those,” Robredo said."" To be fair, where exactly “human rights” begin and where that hard crack down ends is a point of contention in Duterte’s vision. Police, after all, require justification to shoot and kill criminals under Philipine law. However, it is also difficult to justify allowing an official who had categorically expressed an intent to lead a fight “against” you into your team, specially on an initiative that had been the cornerstone of your campaign. Indeed, Robredo even cited her hometown in Naga City, Bicol where, she reportedly pointed out, local government there “were able to achieve the same results without resorting to those things”, to which Duterte responded by assuring her that his government would not interfere with Naga City’s affairs. According to Duterte… ""“I do not also subscribe the style of her leadership. Tabla lang kami — she does not like me, I do not like her, so no problem,” Duterte told reporters in Davao City."" Robredo is also, lest we forget, a member of the Liberal Party (LP), the out-going ruling party presided over by out-going President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III. She ran under the LP banner in partnership with its presidential candidate Mar Roxas. The LP had, over the course of the campaign, sustained a vicious attack on the persons of all candidates running against its fielded bets. In the heat of the campaign, Aquino himself called for a united front against Duterte. Aquino also referred to Duterte as “a future threat to democracy”. Roxas, for his part, mounted an agressive campaign to follow-through on that messaging and, in the final stretch to election day, attempted to forge a last-ditch “unity” alliance with another rival candidate, Senator Grace Poe, presumably to combine their respective voters’ base in the hope of beating Duterte who was, by then leading the polls. Roxas reportedly described that call for unity as “a call for decency”, as if implying that Duterte’s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency. Roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail Poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him… ""In his statement made during a hastily called meeting with the press at his campaign headquarters, Roxas said that what is more important now is the future of the country than the political careers of any candidate. “Uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship are looming over our country once again,” he said. “I call for unity, I call for decency, I call for democracy, I call for the rule of law.”"" So desperate was this project to win the election that President BS Aquino himself issued a statement in support of it framing the effort as “a demonstration of country before self”, essentially saying that Duterte’s presidency would be the death of Philippines. Indeed, Aquino even insisted that the prospect of a Duterte presidency “carried similar dangers to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.” Leni Robredo was, of course, a party to this vicious vilification campaign. She ran under the LP banner, took to the campaign trail with Roxas and Aquino, wore the LP’s yellow colours, and sang from the same Daang Matuwid hymn book. Perhaps someone should ask Robredo what her position is today on that vilification campaign mounted by her party against Duterte. It would be wise for Robredo’s handlers to caution her against even thinking of backpedalling from those statements of her party mates or distancing herself from the LP itself. Doing so would be a clear sign that all of what she said under the LP banner and while wearing those yellow shirts during the campaign were all lies.",1

Congresswoman and Vice Presidential candidate Leni Robredo insists that she doesn’t have any ambition to seek the Presidency. She said it like harboring such an ambition is a bad thing. She brags about being the only one among the candidates who does not aspire to seek any post higher than the vice presidency. I suppose Robredo thinks her statement will make her look “humble” compared to her rivals. She’s been playing this “reluctant” candidate act from the very beginning and her tactic is starting to get old. People are starting to think she is exhibiting false modesty. For one, we’ve heard it all before. Prior to agreeing to be Mar Roxas’s running mate, Robredo kept saying on record that she didn’t have any ambition to be Vice President. Now that she is in the thick of the campaign trail for her VP bid, she is saying the same thing about the Presidency. Somebody ought to tell her to quit saying things she might have to take back later on. It’s so easy for anyone to go back to what she said in the past about her stand on issues and call her out on it. She has to be consistent. Consistency is not a very common trait among Filipino public servants and she’s looking more and more like a typical one. Someone even made a comment saying that the fresh-faced Leni is starting to look like a trapo (traditional politician) because of her hypocritical statements. Second, she’s not making any sense. Does she even know why there is a vice president to begin with? The vice president is someone mandated to act in place of the president in the event of the president’s death, resignation or incapacity. What if something happens to the President and Robredo happens to be the Vice President? Since she keeps saying she does not want to be President, she won’t be able to fill in for the President because she does not want to be in his shoes. The Philippines will be in a dilemma because of her “reluctance”. As someone asked me on Twitter, how can one aspire to be vice-president and never consider the possibility of becoming president even accidentally? I can only scratch my head on that one. It seems Robredo cannot think too far ahead and lacks foresight. That’s not good for someone seeking the second highest government post in the land. She thinks that as the VP, she can continue doing what she wants, like continue pushing her advocacies as if she was still in Congress. But if she becomes VP, she will have to answer to the President. At this stage, if popularity surveys are to be believed, Mar Roxas won’t win the Presidency so the future Philippine President will not be from the Liberal Party. Therefore, Robredo won’t be free to bring her advocacies to a national level if she ever wins the VP post. This was even confirmed by some of Roxas’s supporters. Because a lot of people who will vote for Robredo won’t be voting for Roxas, the latter’s supporters are reduced to begging Robredo’s supporters to vote for Roxas as well and warning them that Robredo won’t be able to implement her policies if Roxas doesn’t win. They are effectively saying that it is useless to vote for Robredo without Roxas as the President. But even if Roxas wins, he has his own agenda and it won’t necessarily be in line with Robredo’s agenda. The two running mates may appear united during their campaign sorties but the truth is, they were just forced to run together by bizarre circumstances. It is like a marriage of convenience for them. If they do not have anything in common, their relationship will break down soon enough. The campaign platform they crow about is only good on paper and will not likely be implemented just like what happened to BS Aquino’s platform in 2009. Besides, we’ve seen enough Philippine Presidents and Vice Presidents whose relationships eventually went pear-shaped in the past. The most recent break-up is between incumbent President Benigno Simeon Aquino and Vice President Jejomar Binay. Binay was even considered a close family friend of the Aquinos but that didn’t stop members of the Liberal Party from mounting an attack on Binay in an attempt to derail his bid for the Presidency. Binay then attacked the BS Aquino administration, which he is still a part of, in retaliation.  Another President and Vice President pair who went their separate ways were the late Cory Aquino and Salvador Laurel respectively. Laurel even wrote a scathing letter to Cory venting his frustration at their “fundamental differences” and the way Cory renege on the promise to be “servants of the people’s will and the people’s well being.” The point is, the same thing can happen to Roxas and Robredo especially since they don’t have a lot in common. I can imagine Roxas must be resenting the fact that, from being plucked from obscurity, Robredo has now overtaken his popularity with the voters. The Liberal Party’s plan to use Robredo to pull Roxas’s popularity up did not work. They did not consider the fact that the voters can choose the President and Vice President separately and not as a team. Robredo’s supporters are insisting that she is a modest and humble person and their proof is in how she uses public transport in travelling to and from her hometown. But there are people who think this is a shallow reason and are not easily impressed by that especially since she travels in luxury using jets and helicopters to campaign sorties out of town. Robredo’s supporters need to get real. There is no such thing as a humble politician. Politicians tend to be narcissists and are full of themselves. They have to be, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to sell themselves effectively. Robredo definitely exhibits narcissistic tendencies whenever she promotes her bid for the VP post. She puts her rivals down in order to pull herself up. She doesn’t believe in winning based on her merits. She thinks she has to badmouth her rivals in order to win. Robredo’s supporters also think she is pious. But a truly pious person will not turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed during the present administration. If she does not have the courage to speak out against BS Aquino and his cabinet members who are not performing their duties as expected of them, then she is not going to be effective in the VP post. She will not be able to “draw national attention to advocacies that need to be pushed”. The BS Aquino government has ignored a lot of the things that need attention in the provinces. The farmers suffering from drought is one of them. We have yet to hear Robredo criticize the BS Aquino government for neglecting the farmers even after the deadly riots in Kidapawan. Robredo’s silence on that matter can be considered tantamount to her condoning the government’s criminal negligence there. It boggles the mind when one thinks of why Robredo is still sucking up to BS Aquino. He didn’t even want to confirm her husband Jesse as Department of Interior and Local Goverment (DILG) Secretary when he was alive. He died with the title “acting” DILG Secretary. BS Aquino made no secret about their fundamental differences in governance and even cited it as a reason for unnecessarily delaying his confirmation. ""“There are various reasons kung bakit acting. In the case of Jesse, we had some differences during the campaign as to style. We want to make sure we can really work with each other well. It does no good to get him through the whole process of the CA only at the end of the day to find out that there might be difficulties in our working style, among others, our core philosophy, so we did agree na acting na muna,” Aquino said."" In short, BS Aquino did not believe in Jesse Robredo. It was even reported that he was about to file charges against BS Aquino’s buddy former DILG undersecretary Rico Puno for various complaints that reached Robredo. Puno was also criticized for breaking into his apartment as soon as news broke that Jesse’s plane was missing. It was rumored that Puno wanted to get “sensitive” documents containing information pertaining to an investigation on Puno and some Philippine National Police officials. Leni even had to ask the Justice Department to secure her husband’s condominium after the break-in: ""Robredo’s wife, Atty. Leni Robredo, admitted to the press in Naga that she herself had made the request that their apartment be secured. According to a report by ABS-CBN’s Anthony Taberna on TV Patrol Thursday, September 6, Leni Robredo had asked for heightened security after she was notified that Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Rico Puno tried to enter Robredo’s condominium and offices in the National Police Commission and the DILG, both in Quezon City."" It was only after Jesse died that the President and the rest of the Liberal Party members started praising Jesse Robredo’s name. This was after they observed the public’s growing sympathy for Jesse. The Liberal Party have certainly made up for their past indiscretions against Jesse by elevating his widow’s status. I guess all is forgiven now that the Liberal Party is helping Leni become Vice President. It turns out she wants the power associated with the post. She thought she’d have us all fooled when she said she is not ambitious.",1

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Leni Robredo is one of those dishonest people who habitually steps onto the 'hero' pedestal to exploit disaster and claim credit at the expense of the quiet achievers..."" It is quite amazing that the Opposition have not realised yet that all “vice president” Leni Robredo offers is the here-and-now and nothing much beyond that. Indeed, at the time of this writing, Robredo is top of mind amongst her fandom having just scored PR points that landed her some media — and social media — mileage owing to her much-photographed “contribution” to the response and relief effort as two major typhoons within weeks of one another ravaged the Philippines. In propagating the same old traditional messaging that aims more towards self-promotion and less to other more honourable intents, Robredo sustains a sticky habit that keeps the political chatter stuck on personalities rather than on ideas. As can be observed by the outcome of The Leni Robredo Show written and produced by the eminent “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards (the rabid bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan that presumes to “lead” the Opposition) in response to the impact of recent typhoons Rolly and Ulysses, practically the entire conversation revolved around who did what or, worse, who did more than the other. The more important part of the conversation — how much in the overall scheme of things was a achieved — took a back seat to all the pettiness. Here, the “overall scheme of things” refers to the broader issue of disaster management — Preparation, Response, and Relief. The latter two, Response and Relief, are often the ones that make the news and, woefully, in the wrong way. The recent episodes starring the “vice president” in the title role illustrate this. Response and Relief are often the most “newsworthy” aspects of disaster management because they have a set of characters not present in the Preparation story — victims. When victims are part of the cast of characters, Filipinos’ favourite protagonist in any story — the Hero — majestically swoops in to save not just the day and but, more importantly, media ratings. While there is a story to be told about Preparation, it is all just too boring for the average attention-deficited televiewer. Tall and dashing fire fighters and the damsels in negligees they carry out of towering infernos are always better at hooking in an audience compared to stories about the geeky fire wardens who walk around the office with clipboards inspecting fire extingquishers and emergency exits. In the case of the dramas spun by PR managers and “news” producers around annual typhoons disasters in the Philippines, the rotten unfairness of it all is the same. When disaster strikes, the “heroes” get disproportionate kudos for the handful of lives saved. But the people who’s job it is to quietly prepare for or, more importantly, prevent disaster routinely go unsung. Yet it is the work of these unsung heroes that save millions of lives. Unfair indeed. Leni Robredo is one of those dishonest people who habitually steps onto the “hero” pedestal to exploit disaster and claim credit at the expense of the quiet achievers whose collective work prevented loss of or impact to life that could have dwarfed the handful “saved” by such crooked “heroes”. Rather than regard the bigger system we are called to design to implement truly systemic and sustainable solutions to mitigate routine risks posed to the Philippines by the typhoons that had long been facts of Filipino life, people like Leni Robredo dumb down essential conversations that need to be had. It’s time Filipinos stop putting up with the intellectual bankruptcy that politicians like Robredo foment. It’s time Filipinos embrace real change and reform their dysfunctional political culture.",1

However, committing a crime because of plain stupidity is still a crime... “Vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo in an online forum with kasambahays (household servants) made a statement encouraging her supporters to be a party to vote buying. The Manila Bulletin reports how Robredo told her audience in that forum to “[accept] money from politicians during the campaign season”… ""“Parati kong sinasabi tanggapin nyo kasi galing din naman ‘yan sa atin. Yung pinambibili ng boto, pera din ‘yan ng taumbayan. Tatanggapin mo pero ang iboboto mo kung sino ‘yung nasa konsensya mo (I always say to accept it because that comes from us. The money they use to buy your vote, that’s people’s money, too. Accept it, but vote who is in your conscience),” she said during a virtual meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 26, with members of Kasambahay for Leni."" First of all, how is Robredo sure that, as she claims, the money used to buy votes is “people’s money”? Campaign funds are mostly sourced from private donors. Robredo seems to suggest that all campaign funds were illegally obtained. That is evidently not true and she is misleading her supporters by suggesting that accepting these bribes is the right thing to do. Worse, Robredo is telling them that this is money that is theirs to take. That is so messed up! Second and the more important point, in issuing the above statement, Robredo violates the law as per Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code where it is stated in paragraph (b), “Conspiracy to bribe voters. Two or more persons, whether candidates or not, who come to an agreement concerning the commission of any violation of paragraph (a) of this section and decide to commit it.” Paragraph (a) which the above refers to states…  ""a. Vote-buying and vote-selling. 1. Any person who gives, offers or promises money or anything of value, gives or promises any office or employment, franchise or grant, public or private, or makes or offers to make an expenditure, directly or indirectly, or cause an expenditure to be made to any person, association, corporation, entity, or community in order to induce anyone or the public in general to vote for or against any candidate or withhold his vote in the election, or to vote for or against any aspirant for the nomination or choice of a candidate in a convention or similar selection process of a political party. 2. Any person, association, corporation, group or community who solicits or receives, directly or indirectly, any expenditure or promise of any office or employment, public or private, for any of the foregoing considerations."" By giving her blessing to these kasambahays to receive bribe money and by assuring them that this is right conduct during an election, Robredo has, effectively come to an agreement concerning the commission of any violation of paragraph (a) (quoted above) with her supporters. Receiving bribes is, by itself, a crime. Robredo should know better than to condone — in this instance, encourage — criminal activity. This is astoundingly irresponsible behaviour coming from no less than a Philippine “vice president” as she is pushing her followers to enter into an illegal transaction with criminals. To be fair, it is clear that Leni Robredo is just plain dumb. A true bonafide crook would not go and make stupid public statement about one’s own crooked intentions. However, committing a crime because of plain stupidity is still a crime — just like a stupid driver driving in a stupid way that puts lives at risk is a criminal.

There’s something about current “vice president” Leni Robredo that quite simply irks a lot of Netizens. Her recent activities distributing relief goods and serving lugaw (congee) and pandesal to evacuees fleeing the aftermath of the Taal volcano eruption should, to be fair, not really be a source of annoyance. Unfortunately for Robredo, Netizens do get annoyed with these lame displays. It is likely because of the silly smile permanently pasted on Robredo’s face that undermines this otherwise sensible PR stunt. Indeed, rather than highlight the plight of the eruption victims, Robredo’s character is what attracts all the attention whether it be adulation or detraction. Regardless of one’s partisan affiliation, one cannot argue that stunts like these make it all about Leni Robredo and not about the the ordinary people caught up in this crisis. One could also blame the media who clamber over one another to get a piece of Robredo’s exhibits and sound bytes and leave very little air time to tell the stories of real people. It’s a clear case of celebrity obsession made perverse by the contextual situation. Worse, the praise being lavished upon Robredo by her supporters makes it look like serving lugaw and pandesal to people is the pinnacle of political achievement. They think her actions are signs that she is a true “leader”. Robredo is basically a person with a job title but with no job description attached to it. She’s just filling time. Robredo’s got too much time on her hands. These sorts of activities would normally be delegated to staff or volunteers by executives with real jobs. And even so, the focus of any documentary would have been on the evacuees and not on the politicians. We all know she’s just doing it for the cameras. Robredo is simply running on empty.

GetRealPhilippines.com,"""How do the members of the campaign team of Leni Robredo feel about being supported by this nefarious terrorist group? An answer to that question is not likely to be forthcoming..."" A disturbing image was tweeted by Al Jazeera correspondent Jameela Alindogan today showing what appears to be a heavily-armed fighter of the Islamic terrorist group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) posing next to a campaign poster of Opposition Yellowtard candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo. It would indeed be interesting to understand what exactly the position the Robredo camp takes with regard to the MILF. The MILF and the older more moderate Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) go way back. The origins of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front as a militant breakaway group from what was once considered a more “moderate” MNLF was over disagreements with the direction being taken by the MNLF leadership back in 1977 towards renouncing its own separatist agenda in favour of a more “conciliatory” deal with Manila then, a direction which bore fruit ten years later for the MNLF.  ""In January 1987, the MNLF signed an agreement relinquishing its goal of independence for Muslim regions and accepting the government’s offer of autonomy. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the next largest faction, refused to accept the accord and initiated a brief offensive that ended in a truce later that month. By one estimate the Mindanao-based Moro Islamic Liberation Front fielded around 3,000 troops."" The MILF are responsible for the massacre of 44 elite officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force (SAF) in 2015. The final report of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Board of Inquiry (BOI) organised to investigate this massacre is available and can be downloaded from the official PNP website here. The massacre transpired in the midst of the execution of “Oplan” Exodus personally overseen by then president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III which aimed to “neutralize high value targets (HVTs)” consisting of international terrorists wanted by the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The atrocity prompted the Philippine Army to wage an “all-out war” against the MILF and, at the time had highlighted a fundamental fear along these lines… ""The military fears Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) might mingle with Moro Islamic Liberation Front members to elude pursuing Philippine Army troopers in Central Mindanao. Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines public affairs office, said one of the challenges in the all-out offensive against the BIFF was the possibility both rebel groups might reunite. The BIFF is a breakaway group of the [Moro Islamic Liberation Front] which is nearing a peace agreement with the government."" In short, the Philippines and its people, from a military perspective, have only one strategic enemy — bad armed men who kill people in an organised manner in the name of a movement or religion. How do the members of the campaign team of Robredo feel about being supported by this nefarious terrorist group? An answer to that question is not likely to be forthcoming considering the Yellowtards’ track record of being tight-lipped when it comes to glaring inconsistencies in the underlying ideology of their dishonest “movement”.

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Leni Robredo has abused that tolerance by being a party to to groups and communities directly engaged in the planning and instigation of activities meant to destabilise and, eventually, overthrow the government of President Rodrigo Duterte."" This is the latest “statement” from “vice president” Leni Robredo related to the recent reorganisation of the Senate that resulted in certain Liberal Party (LP) senators being relieved of their committee chairmanships… ""When we were given the mandate by the people, we were determined to work with this administration to put national interest before politics. But despite our sincere efforts, it is now clear that the Duterte administration is incapable of tolerating dissent, no matter how constructive…"" And here is why the efforts of the “vice president” to make sense in this latest statement failed on three counts: (1) “national interest before politics” This is, of course, coming from Robredo who presumably represents the interests of the LP. The LP, if we recall, primarily characterised its representation to the Filipino people with the use of the colour Yellow across all of its branding paraphernalia. No less than former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III preferred to wear a yellow ribbon to symbolise his national leadership. If the LP was really serious about that focus on nation rather than on politics that Robredo talks about, they would have long ago ditched the use of those Yellow symbols and that “L” hand gesture in favour of true national symbols and colours. (2) “despite our sincere efforts” There was never any “sincere effort” coming from the LP to work with Duterte. In the lead up to the 2016 presidential elections, the LP campaign against current President Rodrigo Duterte was nothing short of vicious. In the heat of the campaign, Aquino himself called for a united front against Duterte. Aquino also referred to Duterte as “a future threat to democracy”. Roxas, for his part, mounted an agressive campaign to follow-through on that messaging and, in the final stretch to election day, attempted to forge a last-ditch “unity” alliance with another rival candidate, Senator Grace Poe, presumably to combine their respective voters’ base in the hope of beating Duterte who was, by then leading the polls. Roxas reportedly described that call for unity as “a call for decency”, as if implying that Duterte’s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency. Roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail Poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him. (3) “the Duterte administration is incapable of tolerating dissent” Setting aside the fact that the “vice president” is woefully inarticulate considering that she is but a heartbeat away from the presidency of a country of more than a hundred million, the Duterte administration seems to have been quite tolerant of her presence as a dissenting voice in the Executive Branch. Indeed, Robredo has abused that tolerance by being a party to to groups and communities directly engaged in the planning and instigation of activities meant to destabilise and, eventually, overthrow the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. She is currently being investigated for her ties with Nicolas-Lewis relating to allegations that her campaign for a seat in Congress in 2013 was funded by foreign sponsors. Under Philippine law, foreign contributions to election campaigns are illegal and politicians caught receiving foreign contributions are subject to permanent exclusion from running for office in the future. Contrary to popular belief, the Philippine media remains the same rambunctious community of “thought leaders” and “journalists” since Filipinos “won their freedom back” in 1986. It is nothing close to being like the broken cowering community of “victims” that Robredo is trying to paint them as. So, by all accounts, there is no evidence that the Philippine government is engaged in any conspiracy or concerted effort to suppress dissent. So, again, it seems “vice president” Leni Robredo is acting and making statements way outside of her element. She is part of the Executive Branch of the Philippine government and does not speak for the Senate which belongs to the Legislative Branch. Furthermore, senators, being senators, are a tough brass-balled bunch who can take care of themselves and don’t normally represent themselves to their constituents in the girly sugar-and-spice manner that characterises Robredo’s lame political act. Best that Robredo find other ways to make herself relevant. She can start by firing her PR team for gross incompetence.",1

GetRealPhilippines.com,"""That Yellowtard figurehead Leni Robredo, would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like Colmenares as 'partners' in 'building a nation' smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of Yellowtardom Cory Aquino herself battled these terrorists."" Documents publicly-available from the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) website detail reports on human rights violations that allegedly occurred under the administration of President Cory Aquino. The documents, dated between the 15th and the 29th December 1988, cite reports issued by London-based Amnesty International that assert that incidences of torture perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “have increased since the Manila government stepped up its counter-insurgency campaign against Communist rebels”. The CIA report also quotes then President Aquino who, in her official response to Amnesty international, defends her government and points to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) as the more culpable party involved in any human rights abuse happening in the Philippines. A report on militant organisations published on the Stanford University website describes how the CPP-NPA is founded on the premise that China is the source of both ideology and resources to effect violent revolution in the Philippines. The report also shows the history of the CPP-NPA’s efforts to solicit support from other terrorist organisations around the world. ""From its 1969 establishment until the 1976 normalization of Philippine-Chinese relations, the CPP-NPA received support, weapons, and funds from China. However, even though the CPP-NPA modeled its armed struggle on China’s own Maoist movement, Chinese support for the CPP-NPA seems to have been limited. The CPP-NPA also sought support, weapons, funds, and training from like-minded groups overseas, including the Japanese Red Army (JRA), the Maoist factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the Sandinistas, the Communist Party of El Salvador, and many other organizations…"" Most disturbing of all is the account of the Stanford report of events that sealed the record of the CPP-NPA as an enemy of the state as well as the baffling way that its current ally, the Liberal Party (today known as the Yellowtards), contributed to the twisting of facts that led to a confused record of these events. ""In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp."" Even back then, the confused nature with which the Philippines’ political leaders respond to clear acts of terrorism was on exhibit. Rather than be unified across partisan interests in condemning a bald atrocity perpetrated by a Cold War enemy the Liberal Party, instead, blamed the attack on the government of then President Ferdinand Marcos. ""Liberal Party members blamed President Marcos for the attack, which had killed much of his opposition. Marcos, who blamed the CPP-NPA for the bombing, responded by suppressing leftist political activity and suspending habeas corpus. These measures marked an increase in Marcos’ power. In response to Marcos’ repression, hundreds of student recruits joined the CPP-NPA. [27] [28] Meanwhile, Sison denied that the CPP-NPA had been involved in the attack."" Things haven’t changed much in the last half-century since. Today, it is interesting how the current Yellowtard-led Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders. Indeed, the Yellowtards and their presidential candidate “vice president” Leni Robredo are in bed with legal front groups of the CPP-NPA as they mount a campaign to prevent the rise of leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte. They use the buzzword “red tagging” to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside. Former Rep. Neri Colmenares who chairs Bayan Muna, one of the legal fronts of the CPP-NPA, is a staunch supporter of Robredo’s bid for the presidency. Not surprisingly, Colmenares would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding with regard to the CPP-NPA’s terrorist activities. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate. Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections. “One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent). That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino. “The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added."" Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat. ""According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda. He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate."" Note that Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case. These have since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building. That Yellowtard figurehead Leni Robredo, purported “leader” of the Philippine Opposition today, would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like Colmenares as “partners” in “building a nation” smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of Yellowtardom Cory Aquino herself battled these terrorists.

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""But while the statement described this 'red-baiting' as 'disinformation', nowhere in the statement does IBON categorically deny Badoy’s allegations — that they as well as other 'progressive' organisations are really just 'legal' fronts of the CPP-NPA."" News has now gotten around that communist front IBON Foundation filed an administrative complaint against Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy among others. IBON Foundation reportedly claim that Badoy engaged in “red tagging”. Presumably, the complaint draws partly from a video showing Badoy allegedly “hijacking” the agenda of a talk show that included IBON Research Head Rosario Guzman. A statement released by IBON Foundation on the 30th January following the incident condemned Badoy for “linking IBON to the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front of the Philippines (CPP-NPA-NDFP)” consistent to what was observed in the video. But while the statement described this so-called “red-baiting” as “disinformation”, nowhere in the statement does IBON categorically deny Badoy’s allegations — that they as well as other “progressive” organisations are really just “legal” fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). Indeed, the closest the IBON statement gets to some semblance of a counterargument against the “red-tagging” charge is this… ""IBON has been explaining economic issues to the public for 41 years. The Duterte administration is attacking IBON because we advocate an economy that upholds the people’s interests most of all. As with activists and other groups, we are undeterred and will continue to support the efforts of the people’s movement to reclaim the economy from the elites that have taken it over."" In short, IBON not only cannot deny their alleged links to the Communist Party of the Philippines, they cannot even assert that Badoy is making a false claim about those links. If you examine the statement closely, what IBON does suggest is that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is against building “an economy that upholds the people’s interests” and is, as such “attacking IBON”. It seems it is IBON, in this instance, that is making an unfounded assertion. They will need to prove that the Duterte administration is implementing an economic policy that runs counter to the interests of the Filipino people to clear the air around this so they could move forward with their complaint against Badoy (if said complaint holds water, that is). It is interesting how the current Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders. A Stanford University report on militant organisations, for example, describes current party-list group Bayan Muna, a key stakeholder in the IBON Foundation, as “a political party connected to the CPP and other groups in the Communist movement.” According to a recent ABS-CBN News report Bayan Muna is part of the Makaybayan bloc of left-leaning party-lists that include “Gabriela, Kabataan, Anakpawis, Migrante, and Alliance of Concerned Teachers.” Like most other mainstream reports and discussion surrounding these “leftist” organisations, the report stops short of describing these groups as being linked to the CPP and the terrorist NPA. It just takes just a little bit of research or observation over readily accessible sources like social media and even old news reports to see that familiar names, organisations, and slogans are common across all the militant groups mentioned thus far. Bayan Muna and IBON Foundation, in fact, often get mentioned in the same paragraph in many such news reports. Dig a bit deeper and you will find the personalities who lead or are, at least, involved with these groups sharing the same social networks. The short of it is, these groups insult the intelligence of Filipinos by continuing to pretend that they are not communists. If IBON Foundation and other communist front organisation are to be taken seriously about their whining about being “red-tagged”, perhaps they need to reflect on their own banal dishonesty first and, following that, get real and start making more truthful statements about themselves, their activities, and their true intentions.",1

Joel Pablo Salud is one of my “favorite” editors in-chief, the other being his mentor Inday Espina Varona. He is very proud of his lack of formal education, yet constantly on the prowl for validation with social media postings of his vast book collection. He asks in his latest PhilSTAR piece: What would you ask the Presidential candidates if given the chance? Salud’s fantasized questions are as predictable as he is self-deluded. ""Will those who enabled the Duterte regime to carry out this inhumanity be charged? What about paid trolls? Will they be held accountable for the widespread intimidation and harassment of those critical of this regime? Should a law be passed deeming troll farms illegal? What about the bereaved families of EJK victims? Will compensation be granted? What of the thousands imprisoned without due process?"" Never mind that there are surveys confirming the trust and approval ratings of the President. In his and his cohort’s minds, we are under the spell of Dutertismo, an environment of magical realism where we think all is well but is actually not. Duterte must’ve undergone tutelage from the barangs of Siquijor early on in his career as a public official which is why he’s never lost an election since he was appointed Vice-Mayor of Davao City in 1986. Salud mentions a number of issues, all against Duterte, not necessarily for the candidates except for the Anti-Terrorism Law, of which Sen. Ping Lacson was the principal author of. But what is their beef with the Anti-Terror Law? It’s simply the power of the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) to arrest without a warrant and detain for 14 days, a suspect upon the approval of the members of the ATC. Mind you, all of the kindred spirits of the leftist-liberal-militants are spared from this proviso. It is nowhere even near as draconian as the British-authored Internal Security At, in force in Malaysia and Singapore. This is the problem with leftist-liberal militants who demand much from the State but want as little intervention as possible. What is contradictory is their stand on the West Philippine Sea. They’re anti-China but their brethren in the Communist Party of the Philippines, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army, and its “legal” National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) have been for the Maoist version of communism since 1968. This was a radical shift from the Marxist-Leninist orientation of the original Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, under Luis Taruc and the Lava brothers. Hypocrisy is another outstanding character trait of Salud and his ilk. They are against the drug war and accuse the State of masterminding extra-judicial killings (EJKs) but refuse to hold the NPA to account for the murder of civililans, soldiers, and policemen in the insurgency. They claim the country’s sovereignty has been subverted by China but gladly open the doors of the country for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate the officials cited in the case filed by the late Jude Sabio, former Sen. Antonio Trillanes and former Rep. Gary Alejano. There is also the ongoing ideological clash between the Pinklawans and the Reds over the inclusion of progressives in the Pinko Senatorial slate and the fact that their hated trapos are guest candidates. They claim they participate in the mainstream to make the people aware of their plight and are fighting for the people and have their support but they haven’t won a direct election since they started participating in the same. The most glaring contradiction is martial law human rights violations. Their revolution is morally justified in their opinion, which is why the State has no right to defend itself and the citizens from the insurgency which they have been conducting against the State and its citizens. This is why there is the Bantayog ng mga Bayani which serves as their memorial for the “victims” of martial law. The 2022 election is the chance of the people to vote these morons out of office. They have continually exploited the poor for their cause but haven’t done anything to lift them out of poverty. They are the malaise in our society as they corrupt the youth believing that “activism” against the government is justified leading them to leave their families to join the NPA in the hinterlands, only to die in encounters with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) later on. It’s about time the likes of Salud and his cohorts be called to account for the consequences of their actions. We have been looking like fools before the international community for having the longest-running insurgency with no end in sight. The onus is not entirely on government as these morons are backed by socialist and communist non-government organisations (NGOs) in Europe which fund them. When will the poor realize that they’re being taken for a ride when the leader of the revolution, Jose Maria Sison, lives comfortably in Utrecht as a political refugee?",1

Communist front Bayan Muna, for one, faced with mounting pressure to justify its continued branding as a party-list group “believes the Aquino administration and its allied groups are behind moves to have them disqualified from the 2013 polls.” Allowing communist elements to exist either as legitimate participants in the democratic process or as outlaws infesting the hinterlands is a lose-lose proposition. If Bayan Muna candidate Teodoro CasiÃ±o, for example, succeeds in his bid for a seat in the Philippine Senate in the 2013 elections, he will have access to the notorious pork barrel funds routinely disbursed by MalacaÃ±ang to Senators (a practice widely-criticised as a means used by the Executive Branch to influence and solicit favours and support from legislators). These funds could then be diverted to the funding of the communist New People’s Army’s (NPA) terrorist activities. This is also an assertion made by a group called the People’s Advocacy for Collaboration and Empowerment (PEACE) who have filed a complaint with the COMELEC denouncing various party lists as including Bayan Muna as mere fronts of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). ""Peace, along with the New Guardians for Freedom and Democracy, and the People’s Advocacy for Collaboration and Empowerment and Pro Democracy Foundation of the Philippines, claims Bayan Muna and several other “communist party-list groups” are using their P70-million yearly pork barrel to fund the New People’s Army (NPA)."" Indeed, although Bayan Muna representative Neri Colmenares denied this claim, it is noteworthy that his official statement to the media did not include any explicit denial of any links between his organisation and the NPA. “They have no evidence against us because there is no truth to their allegations that Bayan Muna is diverting government funds to the NPA […]” Back in 2002, no less than Jose Maria Sison, leader of the CPP and probable commander-in-chief of the NPA issued a press statement describing how the NPA plays a key role in the overall terrorism landscape of the Philippines… ""The revolutionary forces of the Bangsamoro, like the MILF and the progressive section of the MNLF can consolidate their armies and choose the time for launching their own offensives, while the military, police and paramilitary forces of the Manila government are preoccupied with their campaigns of suppression against the revolutionary people and forces in most parts of the archipelago. In the future rounds of revolutionary armed struggle by the Moro people, the reactionary armed forces will fare worse than their continuing failure to destroy a small bandit gang called Abu Sayyaf in the tiny island of Basilan."" The PEACE complaint reportedly cited Bayan Muna as being part of a coalition of several organisations that serve as legal “fronts” to Sison’s communist party… ""[…] no less than Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison identified legal democratic forces that help their cause including the Bagong Alyansyang Makabayan (Bayan), Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), the Pambansang Kilusang Magbubukid or the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), Gabriela, League of Filipino Students (LFS), Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) and KADENA."" The Communist Party of the Philippines is a leading communist party in the Philippines. It remains an underground political organization since its founding on December 26, 1968 and has been operating in clandestine manner since its founding. It aims to overthrow the Philippine government through armed revolution with its direct leadership over the New People’s Army and National Democratic Front. Soon after its reestablishment, the Party linked up with the other cadres and commanders of the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), remnant of the Hukbalahap and engaged them in ideological and political studies, mass work and politico-military training. On March 29, 1969, the New People’s Army was established and on April 24, 1973 the National Democratic Front (Philippines). Afterwards, the CPP launched the “protracted people’s war” a strategical line developed by Mao Zedong during the phase of guerrilla warfare of the Communist Party of China.

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The important lesson lost on the Yellowtards is that you cannot make converts out of people you demonise as part of a foolish strategy to win political points. In a democracy, the ultimate goal is to win votes..."" Apologists of singer Jim Paredes are in a state of profound confusion. As the scandal surrounding a private video of Paredes that somehow fell into the wrong hands and got shared all over social media unfolded, his supporters (mostly members of the current Opposition camp) went from first attempting to suppress discussion by making the topic taboo within their online circles, then, as the authenticity of the video became evident, responding with whataboutisms relative to the “crimes” of the Duterte administration, then, recently, issuing calls to investigate what most agree is a serious crime against Paredes’s privacy. Stepping back further, it is important to note that the initial response of Paredes when queried about the video was to claim the video was “fake”. That alone puts in doubt the sincerity of his subsequent apology. Since that “apology”, Paredes has remained silent. But not his apologists. For many observers who may have found it in themselves to empathise with Paredes’s plight, that initial bout of sympathy evaporated amidst the din of the self-righteous pomposity of his apologists who took it upon themselves to speak for him and, true to form, demonise those who continued to discuss the matter. One interesting idea raised by no less than OPM Legend Leah Navarro is that the person or persons involved in obtaining and spreading the video should be charged. Indeed, a full investigation should be launched so that charges could be laid and the perps involved in this invasion of privacy prosecuted. But that will involve finding out who was at the other end of Jim Paredes’s video chat. So perhaps Navarro needs to give a bit more thought to what exactly she is calling for. Would Paredes even co-operate in such an investigation? Evidently the way forward for the Yellowtards is to put a positive spin on the “scandal”, something that Paul John Caña attempts in his Esquire piece It Shouldn’t Be a Big Deal That Jim Paredes is 67 and Likes to Engage in Online Sex. Caña writes… ""Engaging in a private sexual encounter online is his right as a (very) mature adult, and something no one should fault him for just because he’s past retirement age. That it was made public is unfortunate, but we shouldn’t get our panties all up in a wad just because we find out that a 67-year-old is still a horndog who likes using modern technology to satisfy his urges."" Fair enough. And perhaps this is the path forward the rest of Yellowtardom should have taken rather than lash out at the rest of Filipinodom who engage in a bit of schadenfreude made easy by Paredes’s track record of holier-than-thou posturing. The important lesson lost on the Yellowtards is that you cannot make converts out of people you demonise as part of a foolish strategy to win political points. In a democracy, the ultimate goal is to win votes and not antagonise those who are potential sources of that important poltical resource. Jim Paredes’s apologists should take pause and reflect on the real outcomes of their perverted apologism. Rather than win people over to agree that Paredes’s frailties are human traits we all share, the Yellowtards have, instead, drawn an even harder line between them and us.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""On what legal basis is the office of a senator authorised to take custody of persons-of-interest in an on-going crime investigation?"" According to this Inquirer report, Senator Risa Hontiveros, “with the help of an institution”, took custody of the family of Kian Delos Santos who was allegedly killed by police officers in a botched anti-drug operation. According to the same report, “witnesses” to this killing were also taken by Hontiveros’s office. It seems Hontiveros, in so doing, could be guilty of the following offenses: (1) Illegal detention; and, (2) Tampering with and witholding evidence from the police. On what legal basis is the office of a senator authorised to take custody of persons-of-interest in an on-going crime investigation? In a tweet fielded by Hontiveros she said that “My office will provide full protection & security to the family & witnesses & whatever legal service is needed…” But does the legislature possess legal authority to provide services that agencies from within the executive branch of government — such as the police — already provide? Philippine Congress, after all, is a legislative body, and does not have executive function in government. Furthermore, Congress does not have authority to issue summary judgments on the quality of the way the police conduct their operations. Issuing judgments is the job of the judicial branch of the government. Yet Hontiveros’s colleagues in Congress are seemingly in violation of this basic constitutional tenet, even going as far as suggesting — without proof — that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte “masterminds” the “daily carnage” of the on-going “war on drugs”… ""Trillanes and detained Sen. Leila de Lima scoffed at President Duterte’s order for an investigation of the boy’s killing. “The chief investigator and mastermind of the daily carnage ordering a probe into the Kian killing? What a farcical joke!” De Lima said in a statement."" Indeed, there is the irony in the way the Philippine Opposition dish out their shrill protests around the “trending” hashtag #JusticeForKian on social media, crying bloody “extrajudicial” this and “extrajudicial” that, even as their own leaders wantonly violate every basic step in criminal investigation due process. It raises the question of whether the Opposition’s primary thesis against the Duterte government — that it is “authoritarian” in nature is even true to begin with. The fact is, there is no actual breakdown in state democratic functions at all. What seems to be the real bone of contention is whether or not Filipinos, as a people, are at their best when working within “democratic” frameworks. Stupid politicians — such as Hontiveros and her ilk — who, themselves, seem to lack a fundamental understanding of the very laws they supposedly create and maintain are, in fact, products of a currently-functional democracy. If we break that function into its component parts, here is what we get: 1. Voters elect their executives and legislators. 2. Legislators craft/amend laws representing the interests of their constituents. 3. Executives implement and enforce these laws. 4. Voters review/evaluate outcomes/achivements coming out of (2) and (3). 5. On the basis of (4) determine of politicians are good or bad. 6. Goto (1) Note in the above action/feedback loop how voters play a key role in ensuring that quality is an emergent property as their society cycles through each iteration of this process every several years. The democratic process already exists to support the above cycle. It is the quality of the input provided by Filipinos (via elections) that determines the quality of the products of this cycle. Government officials like Hontiveros, are the unfortunate products of this system. Indeed, the “functioning state” exists both institutionally and in practice in the Philippines. And yet the outcomes remain dysfunctional. So it seems the more confronting discussion should be around what an alternative definition for the notion of a “functioning state” could be. The Opposition insists that the definition should lie along the lines of it being “liberal democratic”. An alternative could be something more appropriate for an urgent need to temper the idiocy of the electorate and mitigation of the flawed thinking that prevails when their definition is in effect. Funny enough, people like Risa Hontiveros who, according to the hymn book she sings off upholds “liberal democracy” are the ones who force Filipinos to question whether liberal democracy — as enshrined in the Yellowtard Constitution of 1987 — is actually the right system for Filipinos.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Indeed, no less than a Philippine senator — Bam Aquino — continued to latch on to a baseless (presumably divinely-inspired) list of 'fake news' sites to substantiate his assertions..."" Despite the length of the Senate inquiry on “fake news” and the amount of noise it generated, there was very little real insight that came out other than the realisation that information is “out of control” in the Philippines and, as a result, “the truth is dead” in its society. Yet, whilst a lot of navel-gazing on the culpability of information producers and regulators went on, there was very little said about the accountability of consumers of all this “out of control” information. Nobody in the body of “experts” that convened this “fake news” inquiry acknowledged that there is something seriously wrong about the collective intellectual faculties of Philippine society that predisposes Filipinos to act and react willy-nilly on false information. Indeed, no less than a Philippine senator — Bam Aquino — continued to latch on to a baseless (presumably divinely-inspired) list of “fake news” sites to substantiate his assertions — never mind that nobody could ascertain how exactly the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) decided which sites should be in that list. As far as Aquino was concerned, it is true because the CBCP said so. Aquino’s way of thinking mirrors the very ignoramous society that has become a hotbed of flawed, sloppy, and lazy thinking — one that could not even clearly define its own affliction and, instead, arbitrarily slaps a popular buzzword, “fake news”, to the cancer killing it from within. For lack of a clear understanding of its own illness, Filipinos (and their “representatives” in their legislature) have simply decided they are “sick” of “fake news”. Not surprisingly, given this sloppy and lazy framing of the problem coming all the way from the top “thought leaders” of the land and the now widely-accepted use of a quaint buzzword to encapsulate it, the wrong solutions have gained traction. One such reported solution is the creation of an “information police” proposed by former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay. The premise of his solution is that the hapless Filipino is “confused by an environment where officials of the executive department, in particular, are able to disseminate false information while demonizing the press, and activist-citizens.” Hilbay envisions his information police as… “[…] a public institution whose sole task is to identify and publicize government dishonesty,” This is quite amusing considering that it is tantamount to a tacit admission that Filipinos are simply too stupid and too lazy to step up to their duty of participating in the democratic processes available to them such as actively engaging with their executives and representatives, voting wisely during elections, and intelligently participating in public discourse among others. A democracy is presumably one where a people is ruled by a government created by the people. When one conveniently forgets that important feature, one becomes the kind of bozo Hilbay is; a bozo who comes up with the following laughable functions of a proposed “information police”: to create standards for verifying information provided by government; to actually verify information provided by government, to publicize its findings, and to issue rewards to citizens who are able to spot fake information provided by public officials. The above functions describe a “police” function that operates under the presumption that government is crooked. When you apply the democratic principle that democratic governments are mandated by the people one can then go on to conclude that a crooked government is one that rules a crooked people. That we have come to this point where bozos like Hilbay could actually come up with the notion of an “information police” and keep a straight face after the punchline, makes us quite sure that the Philippines has truly become a truly effed-up society. Back in 2001 Jaime Licauco pointed out in an Inquirer article that… ""A nation whose policies and rules are based on the assumption that everybody is a cheat and liar unless proven otherwise cannot long endure…"" When we start seeing a spectacular powow such as what transpired on live national TV yesterday, the 4th October 2017, where, presumably, the top legislative minds and media leaders, after hours of “debate”, utterly failed to get to the crux of the matter of the “fake news” cancer afflicting their constituents and where a Philippine Senator pompously waved a document produced by a medieval coven of men-in-robes given blanket immunity from scrutiny by a society of “God-fearing” people, it is perhaps high-time that we reflect on the prescient assertion Licauco issued back in 2001.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Any truly genuine Opposition needs to provide Filipinos innovative options and strategic alternatives. The fake oppositions Filipinos have been subject to (and remain subject to even today) push their agenda through fear and emotional blackmail."" According to Senator Bam Aquino he will be joining a “coalition slate, which will be made up of people willing to speak out and stand up against Malacanang’s policies that may be damaging to the people”. In a post on his website, Aquino called for a need for a “genuine opposition”… ""“In 2019, hindi lang ‘The Force’ kailangan, we need ‘The Resistance’ – a genuine opposition slate. Kailangan ng mga taong magsasama-sama, magtutulong-tulong para labanan ang polisiya ng administrasyon na nakakasakit sa tao. You will find me on that slate,” said Sen. Bam. “You need a slate that’s independent from PDP-Laban, that’s willing to oppose, willing to stand up even if it’s unpopular, and even when it’s dangerous. Kailangan natin ng oposisyon para sa ating demokrasya,” the senator added."" One wonders then… was there ever an “opposition” against the administration of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? According to Aquino, there hasn’t been one — at least not one that was “willing to oppose.” The fact that he is calling his new little project a “genuine” opposition suggests that he is creating the real deal and that any previous “oppositions” were all mere fake oppositions. Perhaps someone should ask Aquino: So what were all those rallies, movements, and calls for “international criminal court” investigations against Duterte in the last 18 months all about? Who are the communists and the Yellowtards? Were all these political posturings, mass actions, and the symbolic gestures made by communists and Yellowtards not expressions of genuine opposition to the incumbent? In short; What exactly does Bam Aquino mean by the term “genuine opposition”? Perhaps I can answer that question for him. The garden-variety “opposition” that has long characterised practically all “opposition” movements and parties (and, yes, even “coalitions”) in Philippine politics have all done no more than serve as platforms for personalities to challenge people in power and pitch themselves as mere replacements. The art and science of political “opposition” in the Philippines has never involved anything bigger or more meaningful than individual personalities and individual agendas. There has never been any long-term vision for the Filipino people nor any clear defining construct around what the Philippines stands for. As a consequence of these persistent intellectual deficits in Philippine politics, there has never been any form of roadmap to the future laid out before Filipinos. Therefore, the goal of a truly genuine opposition is to provide that vision and a definition of “The Filipino” that could frame truly national aspirations towards which a yet-to-be-drawn-up roadmap to the future could guide a nation. The first step is to fill or, at least, narrow the intellectual deficit towards achieving the foundation mindset upon which a truly genuine opposition movement could be built. Aquino should recognise that the Philippines he plans to take on this journey is home to a society that is fixated on the past and is hobbled by much cultural baggage. Indeed, much of these are evident in the very rhetoric of the current presumably non-genuine “opposition”. Today’s “Opposition” cannot move on from using ominous “reminders” of past “tyrannies” which it uses to make Filipinos scared of embracing new ideas and experimenting with new approaches. It is also an Opposition that is backed by the Philippines’ Roman Catholic Church — an institution that has, in many instances over the last 500 years, hindered deep reform in Philippine society by imprisoning Filipinos within medieval mindsets by encouraging belief at the expense of modern facts-based thinking. Aquino, therefore, has an immense challenge in this first step alone — changing the way Filipinos think. The way Filipinos currently think is what sets the agenda of the national discourse. Much of what underpins the rhetoric consists of obsolete problems that beg obsolete solutions. One such obsolete problem is the “Martial Law” bogeyman which is used ad infinitum as fodder for that old “return to authoritarianism” scare tactic that hopelessly paralyses Philippine political discourse. Everything that an incumbent administration does — the way it manages military action, implements emergency measures, proposes changes in governance, and manages public relations — is criticised by traditional “opposition” elements through the lens of a tired reminder to be “vigilant” against imagined but, nonetheless, “chilling” trends that could “lead to a return to authoritarianism”. An athlete that had recovered from an injury cannot get back on top of his game if he or she remains paralysed by the fear of getting injured again. This is the reason, perhaps, why Filipinos cannot seem to unite around forward-focused agendas and, instead, unite in fragments around romanticised historical relics and “heroes”. Different factions and personality cults in Philippine politics have different interpretations of the past. But the future is different — because there is better hope in uniting Filipinos around a common future vision. Therein lies the key to uniting Filipinos on common ground. The focus of the political rhetoric needs to be shifted from the past to the future. In this way, every political activity can answer the question What’s Next? Proponents of current forms of most political movements and activism in the Philippines are left scratching their heads when asked this simple question. “No to a return to authoritarianism!” Ok, so what’s next? “No to US-[insert current president here] dictarorship!” Ok, so what’s next? “No to jeepney phaseout!” Ok, so what’s next? Any truly genuine Opposition needs to provide Filipinos innovative options and strategic alternatives. The fake oppositions Filipinos have been subject to (and remain subject to even today) push their agenda through fear and emotional blackmail. It’s high time a truly genuine opposition lead the way for Filipinos looking for real alternatives. Truly genuine oppositions should not merely oppose for the sake of opposing or for the sake of a person’s (or specific clan’s or clique’s) agenda but build upon the good outcomes of both incumbent and previous administrations as well. It remains to be seen if Senator Bam Aquino really knows what he is talking about when bandying around the term “genuine opposition”. To that, one can only suggest for now: abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""De Lima wasn’t ousted because she was critical of Duterte or because she was digging into his alleged role in the Davao Death Squad. She was ousted by her own colleagues because they believed she was using the Senate to get back at her enemy."" “I might be jumping to conclusions, but what if it is true?” Those are the words of Senator Leila De Lima in her privilege speech right after she said “The implication is that we have a group of serial killers and mass murderers right within the ranks of the organization which is supposed to protect and serve the people… Damn. I won’t blame other people if they start swearing at De Lima. She believes her own lies. She admits to not having the evidence to prove her allegations that there are members of the Philippine National Police who are abusing their power but she already talks to the media, particularly the members of foreign media as if what she’s saying has been proven without a shadow of a doubt. The fact that her privilege speech was addressed to President Rodrigo Duterte is already accusatory. Without providing evidence of her “theory”, she already painted Duterte as the mastermind behind her ousting from the Senate Justice Committee investigating the alleged extrajudicial killings. Her accusations are an insult to the Senators who can think “independently”. De Lima seems to be accusing them too of collaborating with Duterte to undermine her. That is not going to earn her any brownie points among her colleagues. She is digging her own grave. She already earned the ire of some senators and, as such, she should quit talking while she’s ahead. She just keeps yakking away. Her privilege speech is enough to give most people a headache. It was all about how she had become a victim in her crusade to stop the alleged “extrajudicial killings”. Granted, the head of the Executive branch of government does have a track record of strong-arming members of Congress into doing what he wanted them to do, specifically during BS Aquino’s term. This was evident during the impeachment and trial to remove the late former Chief Justice Renato Corona from his post. But there was strong motivation among the congressmen and senators to accede to BS Aquino’s wishes back then — because they had to appease the President so he could give them funds from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP), both of which had been scrapped after the Supreme Court ruled they were illegal. This is not the case with the current administration. Besides, the circumstances of De Lima’s ouster from the Justice Committee chairmanship is different from Corona’s ouster from the Supreme Court. De Lima’s was more of a random decision based on conduct unbecoming of a senator that she had exhibited. Indeed, De Lima wasn’t ousted because she was critical of Duterte or because she was digging into his alleged role in the Davao Death Squad. She was ousted by her own colleagues because they believed she was using the Senate to get back at her enemy. In other words, she was abusing her position and dragging the reputation of the Senate through the mud. To quote Senator Win Gatchalian: ""Senate committees are tasked with shaping policy direction and crafting legislative reforms. Unfortunately, under the leadership of Senator De Lima, the committee on justice had become a hollow vehicle for the fulfillment of personal political vendettas.” “We simply had to put a stop to that,” Gatchalian’s statement said. He said the decision “was a difficult one.” But he added that “In the end, I am confident that we made the right choice to protect the integrity of the Senate and to safeguard its reputation as a true and faithful instrument to further the interests of the Filipino people."""" De Lima is definitely not objective anymore. She has an axe to grind. Some say she is behaving like a mad woman. If she feels like the whole world is conspiring against her, then she should now appreciate what former President Gloria Arroyo felt when she was denied her right to travel abroad and her right to presumption of innocence back in 2011. That was the time De Lima stopped Arroyo at the airport as she was leaving to seek medical treatment abroad and detained her even when there was no case against her at that time. De Lima is now holding on to the sole witness against Duterte, Edgar Matobato – a witness she did not tell the other members of the Justice Committee she will be presenting beforehand. In her privilege speech, she did not really explain why she did not tell Senator Panfilo Lacson about Matobato. She just said that as early as 2009, “Edgar Matobato has already been identified by one DDS witness as a companion of said witness in one of his DDS.” As if that makes any sense at all. This raises the question as to why De Lima didn’t use him earlier. I dare De Lima supporters to ask her why she didn’t use Matobato against Duterte when she was still the Chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) or when she was Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ). What the hell is wrong with people who still believe in De Lima’s drama? She failed in her roles in the CHR and DOJ, now less than six months in the Senate, she is proving to be a failure as a senator too. There are still gullible people who believe in people who play the victim card. They pose a hindrance to Philippine progress. Some of De Lima’s supporters say they would rather believe the words of Matobato — a murderer who confesses in his role in the Davao Death Squads — than the words of a convicted drug lord like Herbert Colangco. While both Matobato and Colangco are both scumbags who are just trying to save their own asses because they don’t have a choice, Colangco’s testimonies against De Lima are supported by the fact that he ran Bilibid like he owned the place and he did it with impunity since as he insinuated, De Lima turned a blind eye to his activities because she was getting a cut from his seedy profits: ""During a congressional inquiry on drug proliferation at the New Bilibid Prisons, Colangco likened the prison facility’s maximum security compound to the Manila red-light district in Roxas Boulevard. Ang maximum po ay ginawa ko talagang parang Roxas Boulevard. Kahit walang dalaw, sample model binayaran ko ng P25,000 sa labas, ibebenta ko sa loob ng P75,000,” Colangco said in the House of Representatives. (I turn the maximum [security prison] into Roxas Boulevard. A sample model I pay P25,000 for outside, I sell for P75,000.) Colangco said he was running a resort-like hotel with facilities like air-conditioning and shower inside the maximum security compound. He earlier confessed selling boxes of beer during his concerts in the Bilibid, which he said Senator Leila de Lima had allowed in exchange for share in the money."" How can De Lima explain these allegations? She was DOJ Secretary for six years but did not stop or was too incompetent and, possibly, too corrupt to stop the debauchery that went on inside the national penitentiary. This is an outrage. This is something her supporters need to address too. They can’t let her off the hook just because they hate Duterte. The current problems Duterte has to deal with are the result of the previous government’s ineptitude, which De Lima was a part of. She just doesn’t have the moral high ground to criticise Duterte for her own failures. I do hope that the new Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre will file formal charges against De Lima soon so De Lima can have her day in court. We all know that senate hearings are mostly in aid of grandstanding politicians, not legislation.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""This astounding use of public resources in the service of a private enterprise — the business interests of ABS-CBN — is a a clear case of plunder. Senator Grace Poe better give the Filipino public a good reason why she should not be charged for that crime."" ressure is mounting on Senator Grace Poe to hold herself accountable for misappropriating public resources down a Senate “inquiry” into the ABS-CBN franchise renewal “issue”. The “inquiry” which Poe claimed was “in aid of legislation” has done nothing beyond giving ABS-CBN a platform for emotional blackmail. Poe is hard-pressed to report to the Filipino public what lessons were learned from the “inquiry” that could be applied to aid legislation. Thus far, what did come out of this circus is working against Poe. Laid bare thus far is how much money her family is making off the cozy relationship her family estate enjoys with Big Corporate ABS-CBN. A recent eye-opening exposé into the Poe family’s financial interests in ABS-CBN (and vice versa) authored by former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao featured in the Manila Times details just how lucrative this relationship is. It starts with Poe’s mother, Susan Roces (widow of her late father Fernando ‘FPJ’ Poe Jr), currently being a major contracted talent of ABS-CBN… ""Her mother plays the role of a main character (Flora “Lola Kap”) in ABS-CBN’s hugely successful drama “Ang Probinsiyano,” which has been running for over four years, with about 1,136 episodes. Lola Kap is a village captain and the sagacious grandmother of the series’ hero Cardo (played by Coco Martin), who imparts life lessons in most every episode. Assuming that Roces gets a very conservative P200,000 per episode, that means income for her of over P230 million so far from that ABS-CBN production. That’s a fair estimate, considering that lead actor Martin is known to have become a billionaire from his earnings from “Ang Probinsyano.”"" Tiglao goes further to cite how the estate of FPJ — presumably under his surviving heirs’ management — very likely earns royalties from every commercial use of its intellectual assets; for example, everytime an FPJ movie is streamed via ABS-CBN’s extensive portfolio of global content distribution channels. Thus the obvious next step, taking her up on her claim that this “inquiry” was done “in aid of legislation”, is for Poe to spell out what the next steps are. That is in assuming, of course, that Poe had thought things through that far ahead when she initiated this “inquiry”. By the way she and members of the Opposition had been giving one another mutual high-fives in the couple of days following the ABS-CBN “inquiry”, it seems that no such next steps were even thought about to begin with. Indeed, they are celebrating the dishonest outcome — the award-winning theatrics of ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak during the “inquiry” and his subsequent elevation to idol status by his newly-acquired fandom — as an end of itself. This astounding use of public resources in the service of a private enterprise — the business interests of ABS-CBN — is a a clear case of plunder. Senator Grace Poe better give the Filipino public a good reason why she should not be charged for that crime. The first step in the right direction is to demonstrate that this exercise will lead to new legislation to improve corporate regulation in the Philippines. Failing this, it then becomes clearly evident that Poe lied about her stated intention — that this exercise was “in aid of legislation” — when she initiated this “inquiry”.",1

I feel [deep] personal shame because of that.” It is not often that we see politicians making statements in solidarity with the Philippine government overall (as opposed to solidarity limited along partisan lines at best). A tweet fielded by Senator Bongbong Marcos today demonstrates this sort of winning attitude… ""Pag tinatanong ako ng pamilya ng #SAF44 “Ano na ang nangyari sa hustisya na pinangako?” Wala akong masagot. Nahihiya ako."" Translated: “When the [grieving] families of the 44 Philippine Police Special Action Force officers [massacred in Mamasapano] ask me about progress being made delivering promised justice for them, I have nothing to report. I feel [deep] personal shame because of that.” By saying that, Marcos is essentially owning up to government’s overall responsibilities to its people. It is a good model of statesmanship — openly expressing his willingness to be one with the national government that he is part of in being accountable for its inability to meet the public’s expectations of it. No ifs or buts and no blaming predecessors or other parties. Indeed, as far as Filipinos are concerned, Senator Marcos is part of their government. To that expectation, he steps up. The prime suspects involved in the cold-blooded massacre of these police officers early this year, allegedly elements of the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front, have yet to be apprehended. For that matter, there are no updates on or any evidence of on-going pursuit efforts. In short, it is safe to assume that the Philippine government is not mounting any action at all to apply the full force of the law towards bringing these criminals to justice, nor is the Moro Islamic Liberation Front leadership exhibiting any interest in achieving the same outcome. For a politician to categorically state that the failure of his government is his own personal failure is ground-breaking indeed. The Philippines, after all, is blame game and mudslinging country — specially during election campaign season. It takes a special breed of politician not seen in recent years to rise beyond the dismal quality of today’s political discourse in the Philippines. Unfortunately, for Filipinos, Marcos is an infinitesimal exception to the rule. Filipino politicians are simply unable to measure up to the rare statesmanship that was once in abundance in the bygone early days. No less than President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III has institutionalised blame politics and brand partisanship in the Philippines over the last five years of his rule, effectively colouring his entire administration with the relentless demonisation of his predecessor, former President Gloria Arroyo, and embedding his politics of exclusion by monomanically sticking to his partisan Yellow colour instead of wearing the true national colours and behaving like a real head of state. Filipinos have forgotten what true statesmanship is like thanks to decades of being subject to the BS of one bozo after another. Tragic. Statesmanship is really fundamentally just all about being and speaking like a gentleman. It is not hard. You just need to be an honourable person in word and deed who takes the responsibilities of his job seriously by regarding himself as being accountable for the performance of the larger organisation he represents.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Every time BS Aquino mentions the name Marcos, the voters unconsciously give the senator’s performance as a public servant a second look and they begin to see him as his own man, separately from his father."" Why has Senator and Vice Presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos become so popular with Filipino voters? There are plenty of reasons why but the number one reason is because of his Number One critic, current President Benigno Simeon Aquino. A lot of voters have become disillusioned by BS Aquino’s performance over the six years he’s held office. They realize that he is quite an unpleasant man who is only good at blaming other people for his own failures. His character is such a turn-off. It doesn’t help that he doesn’t have a face that could launch a thousand ships. It is a cringe-worthy experience watching the President speak in public. It’s hard to tell if it is because of the shape of his mouth, which looks like it is always upside down or because his mouth is always spewing negative things about other people. Either way, BS Aquino is just so uninspiring. He has never been one to inspire unity in Philippine society anyway. In fact, his speeches are quite often about how “evil” his rivals are compared to him. People have noticed how hypocritical he is by casting himself as pious while throwing negative propaganda against his political enemies. A truly pious person will never speak ill of others. Because Marcos, Jr is a threat to the so-called Aquino “legacy”, BS Aquino has shifted to full gear in trying to knock the senator’s popularity down. BS Aquino, the son of the late “democracy icon” and former President Cory Aquino would be a laughing stock indeed, when the Marcoses return to Malacanang. Ironically, the more BS Aquino talks negatively about the Marcoses, the more people give Marcos Jr a second look. It appears that BS Aquino and his supporters do not understand the concept behind public relations. They inadvertently help give Marcos Jr free publicity at the height of campaign season for the Presidential Elections. As they say, all publicity is good publicity. This brings us to another reason why Marcos Jr has become popular with voters. Every time BS Aquino mentions the name Marcos, the voters unconsciously give the senator’s performance as a public servant a second look and they begin to see him as his own man, separately from his father. The problem with BS Aquino and his supporters is that, it has become obvious that the only things they can use against Marcos Jr are the atrocities allegedly committed by his father’s government during the Martial Law years and nothing about his performance as a senator. They keep insisting that Marcos Jr has not apologized for them. But Martial Law was declared when he was only 15 years old. How can they blame the atrocities committed by members of the Philippine military and police on someone who was still a teenager when they occurred? Some people are suffering from a bad case of tunnel vision that they can’t think straight anymore. On one occasion, BS Aquino criticized Marcos Jr for dyeing his gray hair black. Only a bald man would notice another man’s hairdo, I suppose. BS Aquino’s hypocrisy was made more evident when he hosted the Japanese Emperor and Empress recently. During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army committed worse atrocities against the Filipino people and yet BS Aquino recently welcomed the Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko in the country. While BS Aquino sees the importance of making peace with one of the country’s previous oppressors, he doesn’t see the importance of making peace with the Marcoses. He talks about them as if they did nothing good for the country. This despite the fact that a lot of the infrastructure built during the Marcos years like the Philippine International Convention Center, the North and South Luzon tollways, the Philippine Heart Center, and the San Juanico bridge among others are still being utilized by Filipinos today. We also need not mention some of the policies initiated by Marcos Sr like sending overseas contract workers abroad to help the economy still benefit even the BS Aquino administration today. Yes, those are some of the things that give voters something to think about. Unfortunately for BS Aquino, the more he highlights how bad the Marcoses are, the more he highlights that he is worse than his enemies. This brings us to yet another reason why Marcos Jr is becoming popular. Despite the negative propaganda thrown at him, Marcos Jr still manages to smile and take things with a grain of salt. The voters notice this and find him a refreshing alternative to the hostile demeanor BS Aquino quite often projects. Indeed, what the Philippines needs is a leader who will promote unity and harmony among Filipinos and not someone who promotes discord and division like BS Aquino. The voters have had enough of him and his despicable personality.",1

A VERA Files “report” falsely flagged as “false” the 2016 Get Real Post article “Leni Robredo disqualified from the VP post due to LP non-compliance to COMELEC policy!”. The GRP article, pointed out how, in the 2016 elections “Robredo’s running mate and Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas as well as the Liberal Party itself failed to meet the deadline imposed by the Commission on Election (COMELEC) on the submission of the [Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs)].” Cited was Section 14 of Republic Act 7166 in effect at the time which stipulates the “Effect of Failure to File Statement”; to wit, “no person elected to any public offices shall enter upon the duties of his office until he has filed the statement of contributions and expenditures herein required.” Most notably… ""The same prohibition shall apply if the political party which nominated the winning candidate fails to file the statement required herein within the period prescribed by this Act."" At the time the article was published on the 10th June 2016, the 8th June deadline imposed by the COMELEC to file the SOCE had just lapsed and, as such, it was safe to assert that Robredo was effectively disqualified from taking her position as presumptive “vice president”. VERA Files asserts that GRP makes a “false claim” because “the Liberal Party in 2016 appealed to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to extend for another 14 days the deadline for filing of statement of contributions and expenditures (SOCE) for that year’s polls” and that “the LP was able to submit its SOCE for the elections several days before the extended deadline set by the election body. No disqualification took place and Robredo was sworn into office as the country’s 14th vice president on June 30, 2016.” However, VERA Files dishonestly omits an important detail. Section 2 of Rule 10 issued by the COMELEC applicable for these 2016 elections states that there is absolutely no provision to allow an extension of the 8th of June deadline for filing the SOCE for any reason whatsoever… ""The 08 June 2016 deadline shall be final and non-extendible. Submissions beyond this period shall not be accepted. COMELEC Resolutions Nos. 9849 and 9873, Minute Resolutions Nos. 13-0775 and 13-0823 are hereby repealed, insofar as they allowed the belated submission, amendmentand/or correction of campaign finance disclosure statements and reports and the imposition of late penalties for the 2013 National and Local Elections."" Taking the above into account, GRP at the time it published the article “Leni Robredo disqualified from the VP post due to LP non-compliance to COMELEC policy!” on the 10th June of 2016 made an accurate appraisal of the dire situation Robredo and the LP found themselves in at the time — that she and the rest of LP’s lineup of “winning” candidates in those elections faced outright disqualification for non-compliance to a non-negotiable COMELEC election rule applicable at the time. In actual fact, it is VERA Files that makes a false claim in this instance. It is also worth noting that the head of VERA Files, Ellen Tordesillas, is a known supporter of the Liberal Party and rabidly loyal to one of its top attack dogs, former “senator” Antonio Trillanes.

ABS-CBN, after all, is the Philippines’ biggest channel for Filipinos’ favourite Batang Yagit style entertainment. Producing these shows is their lucrative expertise.

It is not a surprising result considering that Senator Grace Poe who headed the “inquiry” is, herself, a showbiz product and, more importantly, is both financially and emotionally invested in ABS-CBN on account of her father’s legacy being intimately intertwined with the company’s fortunes.

She doesn’t have anything much against Marcos Jr..."" The one and only Vice Presidential Debates hosted by CNN Philippines became mostly about Senator Bongbong Marcos. If not for Marcos Jr, the debates would have been boring. It seems most people just want to hear from him and what he has to say. Well, except of course for the hecklers who kept interrupting him by chanting “Never Again”. The irony of what the members of the Never Again movement are doing escapes them. They complain about human rights abuses but are also quick to deny an individual’s right to presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial. They are not even good at following rules. They kept heckling even when the rules from organizers were clear against heckling and interrupting the proceedings. They behaved like they were an audience in a gladiator ring – uncivilized. The members of the Never Again movement do not want to listen to what Marcos Jr had to say because they are afraid they could be proven wrong. His rivals like Congresswoman Leni Robredo kept bringing up the victims of Martial Law even when their cases have already been settled. They didn’t bother to understand what Marcos Jr was saying about the status of the settlement. It turns out that the current government under President Benigno Simeon Aquino is the one delaying granting reparation claim. In the last two years since the law granting the compensation was enacted, hardly anything has been done.  It seems BS Aquino’s law was simply for public relations purposes – to make him look compassionate to so-called victims of Martial Law. But this is only on paper and was not followed through by action. ""Samahan ng Ex-detainees Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto or SELDA said the delay in granting the compensation “reflects how the Aquino government treats human rights victims then and now,” as it noted that instead of diminishing, the number of human rights violations has increased in the waning months of the current administration. It also pointed out Aquino has yet to name a replacement for former HRVCB member Chito Gascon, who is now chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, causing even more delays in the panel’s work."" Leni Robredo came across as not well-informed about the status of the compensation claims of Martial Law victims. She just sounded like a broken record. She doesn’t have anything much against Marcos Jr except for atrocities allegedly committed by his family during Martial Law. She is irrational when it comes to putting Marcos Jr down. Maybe that’s from hanging out too much with an irrational crowd like the Never Again advocates. The problem with Robredo is she is too beholden to the Aquino name. She keeps turning a blind eye to atrocities committed during Aquino’s term. She promotes her platform and ideas on how to solve the country’s problems while ignoring the fact that the country’s problems worsened in the last six years. At least the other VP candidates acknowledge the current government’s shortfalls. Robredo may have good ideas but being associated with the Liberal Party is pulling her down. Senator Alan Peter Cayetano acted like he was in a Senate hearing. He was acting like a mad dog spewing baseless accusations against his rivals. He spoke as if he is not corrupt. He probably thinks the public hasn’t read the news item about the Commission on Audit asking both him and his sister to return unused pork barrel funds: ""“Pursuant thereto, the unutilized/unused  PDAF funds for the period CY 2010 to 2013 from the legislator proponents of different projects in the amount of  P39,588,528.41 as of December 31, 2013 as shown in the Subsidiary Ledgers should not be disbursed and has to be remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr),”  COA said in its report. COA said Alan has to return P21 million of the P44 million pork funds he gave to the city. The pork funds were for the purchase of 18 multi-cab units worth P9 million, construction of North Signal Village Health Center worth P5 million, financial assistance for indigent patients in Taguig City Hospital and Western Bicutan for P3.5 million, financial assistance to families in crisis worth P5 million, and construction of 5 multi-purpose buildings for P21.5 million."" Cayetano came across like a hypocrite. He is against political dynasties but is married to Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano. He is also the brother of Senator Pia Cayetano. No wonder the voters do not like him. He is so unpopular in surveys even when he is already teamed up with Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who has become second most popular Presidential candidate. All the other Vice Presidential candidates were so boring. Senator Chiz Escudero is only popular because he is married to a beautiful young actress Heart Evangelists. There is nothing special about his ideas of governance. He is also into patronage politics. We recall that he was one of the senator judges who voted to impeach former Chief Justice Renato Corona even when as a lawyer, he should have known that the charges against him were trumped up and that information used against him were gathered illegally especially when Anti-Money Laundering Council divulged his bank accounts without Corona’s consent. Senator Trillanes spoke about his ideas like fixing the traffic problems as if it was as easy as installing another light rail transit. The government cannot even manage the maintenance of the Metro Rail System properly but he wants to add more of them. It’s quite bizarre why Trillanes is running for the Vice Presidency when he knows he is not popular. He should still be serving his jail term for rebellion. The only reason BS Aquino pardoned him was because he was jailed during former President Gloria Arroyo’s term. We all know BS Aquino hates Arroyo. Trillanes’s enemy is BS Aquino’s enemy. Another Vice Presidential candidate who does not have a chance of winning is Senator Gringo Honasan. As much as he appears to have sound ideas, his charm with the crowd has faded. The sparkle in his eyes is gone. He doesn’t seem relevant to the voters anymore. I doubt if any of the members of the audience actually listened to what he had to say. It doesn’t help that he is associated with Vice President Jejomar Binay. Sometimes that’s all it takes to lose. Just ask Mar Roxas who is associated with BS Aquino. The VP debates are more entertaining than the Presidential debates. Frankly, the Vice President is not really going to make a difference in the policies of the President particularly when the President is from a different political party. But if Duterte wins and fails to curb criminality within six months as promised, he might turn over the Presidency to his Vice President Marcos Jr. Assuming the latter wins the VP. In a democracy, the voters will decide on that.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""...no miracle is really needed to erase the stigma of being 'a Marcos' that Bongbong bears. Senator Marcos simply needs to work harder and deliver more results."" Recall back to the twilight years of the presidency of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. Back then, Aquino was so desperate to shore up the flagging political fortunes of his party that he would go as far as reminding Filipinos to stop referring to the regime of former President Ferdinand Marcos as the Philippines’ “Golden Age”. This followed a realisation that was slow to come to his camp of the immense popularity of then vice presidential candidate Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr and the grave threat if posed to his dynasty. It didn’t help Aquino’s Liberal Party at the time that no less than a New York Times report asserted that Filipinos yearn for a return to a similar Golden Age marked by a Marcos back in Malacanang…""Michelle Pulumbarit, 31, a customer service operator who lives north of Manila, said Mr. Marcos was putting forward a proposal for the future that will bring back the best of the Marcos years. She is not concerned about martial law and human rights violations, she said. “For me, those are things of the past,” she said. “That was a time when our economy was booming. Even Imelda did a lot of good things. She shared our culture with the world. I can forgive her for having so many shoes.”"" A key concern amongst anti-Marcos campaigners lies in what they regard as an “alarming” position taken by young Filipinos who form a huge proportion of the Philippines’ pool of voters. Most Filipino “millenials” who were equipped primarily with anecdotal evidence of the Martial Law years had expressed a widespread disillusionment with the “democracy” pitched to them under the “EDSA People Power” flag. They only saw the absolute wretchedness of life in the Philippines and took the position that things need to change — and that the closest model of how things should be in the Philippines was a time when discipline and order ruled…""Apple Buiza, 26, an employee of a Manila aluminum siding company, said the fate of Imelda Marcos’s jewels was not a priority for her in the next election. Ms. Buiza spends hours each day battling traffic to get to work and is frustrated by the current government. She said she has heard stories of how orderly the country was during the Marcos years. “During the time of martial law, the Philippines was disciplined,” Ms. Buiza said as she gestured toward a group of jaywalkers dodging vehicles and blocking traffic. “People don’t even know how to cross the street now.”"" It is now a widely-held theory that the renewed — and surging — interest in the virtues of the Martial Law Years of former President Marcos and its regard as a “Golden Age” by some Filipinos is a direct result of a lack of any progress realised over the 30-odd years that followed the 1986 “people power revolution” and, more specifically, over the six years of the Second Aquino Administration. It could be said that The Great Democratic Experiment of the Philippines was marked more by a wholesale missing of the real point of freedom of an entire society and a series of governments that ruled since 1986. Instead of a stronger nation, what emerged after 30 years is a country characterised by a non-existent fighting capability, mainstream media networks that dumb down rather than enlighten their audiences, and a people that lack a clear picture of what their long-term future might look like. The trouble with Aquino was that, as president, he focused most of his media time on vilifying his predecessor former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, blaming “corruption” supposedly perpetrated by previous administrations, and waxing poetic about his parents’ “heroic” legacies. Meanwhile, then Senator Bongbong Marcos sustained a message to the public consistently themed on the future and moving towards it. Back in early 2015 in the days immediately following the massacre of 44 Special Action Force (SAF) troops by elements of the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front, then Senator Marcos charted a crystal-clear three-point way forward out of the ensuing crisis that gripped the country in its aftermath. While the Malacanang of then President Aquino suffered an astounding paralysis and repeatedly stammered out mixed messages to the public as the much-vaunted Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) initiative was crushed under the public relations fallout from the massacre, Marcos was in the field cobbling together consensus on how to proceed and assuring a bewildered Filipino public that options were being explored. Suffice to say, the manner with which Marcos stepped up to the challenge while Aquino and his entire Cabinet descended into an orgy of internal bickering and incompetent statesmanship did not help at all. As is evident in the NYT report, Filipinos long before then had already developed a healthy cynicism for the brand of “demo-crazy” sold to them by the Aquino-Cojuangco clan. Even the whole notion that the Aquinos and Cojuangcos are symbols of the “Spirit of EDSA” is now being challenged. Indeed, Marcos worked hard to save the Philippines from the clutches of the Bangsamoro Basic Law. He had, in the process, demonstrated an ironic allegiance to the Philippine Constitution — a national charter that was crafted under the watch of no less than President BS Aquino’s mother, former President Corazon ‘Cory’ Aquino. As chief Senate reviewer of the proposed BBL in 2015, the junior Marcos exhibited the sort of statesmanship and diplomacy that the original Malacanang negotiating team led by Secretary Teresita Quintos-Deles and Miriam Coronel-Ferrer utterly lacked. Over the course of the review, Senator Marcos tirelessly travelled all over the country to consult with everyone potentially affected by the proposed law that would have seen a vast chunk of Mindanao ceded unto the hands of the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The outcome of the investigation was nothing short of conclusive. The BBL was unworkable and would have resulted in an outcome the opposite of what its authors promised the Filipino people. Despite these achievements, however, many Filipinos continue to hate Senator Bongbong Marcos. Why? Because of his surname. Senator Marcos’s father was the late former President Ferdinand E Marcos. Filipinos cannot seem to see past that fact. That is strange, because many of these people are the same people who are advocates of “voter education”. A cornerstone of this initiative to develop an intelligent vote in the Philippines is to change the way Filipino voters evaluate candidates running for office. Voter education champions encourage Filipinos to ditch their traditional practice of voting on the basis of name- and face-recall in favour of qualifications and record of achievement. Yet, to his detractors, he is still and only just “a Marcos”. That’s, quite simply, being small-minded. Then again, it makes sense of course. Filipinos are predominantly Roman Catholic. Catholics live by the baffling notion that babies are not born innocent. They believe babies are born guilty of Original Sin. To erase that “sin”, no less than the Son of God needed to be put up as human sacrifice to appease his own father. That explains the primitivist way Filipinos continue to regard Bongbong Marcos. In Filipinos’ minds, Bongbong is guilty of his father’s alleged sins. So for arguments’ sake, perhaps we should ask ourselves: What does Bongbong Marcos need to do to absolve himself of his father’s sins? Unlike the divine intervention needed to absolve Catholic babies of their guilt, no miracle is really needed to erase the stigma of being “a Marcos” that Bongbong bears. Senator Marcos simply needs to work harder and deliver more results. And so far as we’ve seen, he has demonstrated that stepping up to any challenge does not faze him at all. It’s been almost four decades and the national narrative (as propagated by the powers-that-be) remains stuck in a bygone past — an age when ordinary people supposedly lacked today’s much-hyped technological capability to more effectively “spring” change from the grassroots. Indeed, a people who lacked mobile technology and social media supposedly instigated a “revolution” over a three-year period since Ninoy Aquino’s assassination in 1983. Today, 25 years since the Internet became available to ordinary users and roughly 15 years since the dawn of social media, Filipino “activists” have failed to step up to the promise of uplifting the quality of the way their compatriots participate in a democracy that aspires to join the modern world. Perhaps it is time to regard our politicians using a different way of thinking. You see, it is only when Filipinos become pro-achievement first before being merely and only pro-[insert politician’s name here] that we can hold hand to heart and claim to be a real democracy.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The fact is, nobody — not even diehard Yellowtards — seem to be interested in commemorating the event where it matters."" Liberal Party President and Senator Kiko Pangilinan put up a brave appeal to Filipinos to sustain the Yellowtard tradition… “The idea behind the Yellow Ribbon Campaign came from our chapter leaders and members. This is a crucial ingredient for a successful movement. Let’s bring our efforts back to the people. Let them own it,” Pangilinan said. For her part, “vice president” Leni Robredo added her two cents on the matter in her usual Tagalog form…The fact is, nobody — not even diehard Yellowtards — seem to be interested in commemorating the event where it matters. When will the Yellowtards get it? More importantly, when will the broader Opposition realise that their “cause” is being hobbled by their continued association with these people? Filipinos deserve a BETTER Opposition, not the intellectually-bankrupt one currently being led by the Yellowtards.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The Yellowtards need to let go of the delusional strategy they currently apply to their campaign where members within their comfy echo chambers assure one another of the righteousness of their 'cause'..."" The withdrawal of Senator Bong Go as presidential candidate consolidates the administration bet for leadership of the Philippine government over the next six years following the May 2022 national elections. For the first time since 1986, a majority-elected Philippine president has become a possibility if we are to consider the popularity numbers of leading candidate Bongbong Marcos. Together with his running mate Sara Duterte, the two collectively account for the lion’s share of polled voter preferences over the last 12 to 18 months. With President Rodrigo Duterte running for a Senate seat and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo a strong contender for House speakership if she succeeds in her bid for a congressional seat, Filipinos may be witness to the rise of the most powerful Philippine government yet. The Opposition led by the Yellowtard “KakamPink” camp of “vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo are already shittin’ bricks over the coming together of a “four party alliance” that will back the Marcos-Duterte tandem. The alliance is a formidable and experienced coalition. Together, the parties that make it up had collectively catapulted three presidents to power; Arroyo, Joseph “Erap” Estrada, and Fidel Ramos. As if that were not enough to crush the spirits of the Yellowtards and their new unfriends, the communists, the administration camp have also managed to attract the support of all 44 mayors of the province of Cebu. The key to Marcos’s success can be gleaned from what Rappler “journalist” Lian Buan was forced to admit in her piece “Marcos woos Duterte vote, gets backing of Cebu mayors” published the other day where she “reports”… ""A divisive figure because of his father’s dictatorial rule marked with human rights violations and corruption, Marcos has so far stuck to a message of unification and says he shuns “gutter politics.”"" Marcos had remained consistent to this tack even as other candidates — most notably Robredo herself — stuck to the tradition of mudslinging and demonisation as a means to prop up their personal brands. Marcos exhibited grace even in the face of attack from President Rodrigo Duterte himself who, at one time, referred to him as a “weak leader” and even hinted that he uses cocaine. Robredo, for her part, in mid-November had already recognised the fatal effect on her political brand caused by overzealous bird-brained partisans. The bigotry in the Robredo camp was at such levels that many reported family ties and friendships collapsing over political differences leading Robredo to urge her followers to “initiate reconciliation, approach other people, and when you see something untrue or something that does not coincide with our beliefs, explain in a calm and respectful manner.” ""“Nasaang panig ka man, gaano man kasigurado sa paninindigan mo, may nakasakit ng kapwa. Panahon na, tayo na ang magsimula, lumapit sa mga naka-alitan, kung may nakita sa social media na hindi naaayon sa mga pinaniniwalaan natin, magpaliwanag nang mahinahon at may respeto,” Robredo said."" Politics is, indeed, addition. The Yellowtards are learning their lessons too late and instituting too little reforms within their ranks. Their embedded culture of Martial Law Crybabyism, fear-mongering over the fantasy of a “return to authoritartianism”, and a stubborn parroting of elitist concepts like “human rights” and “gender equality” that are irrelevant — even alien — to the average Filipino had really done them in. As a result, they have ended up even more disunited now than they were just a few months back when an early attempt at an Opposition coalition dubbed “1Sambayan” sought to elevate one single unifying Opposition candidate to go up against the administration camp. Meanwhile, the administration camp has achieved all of that and more — a single presidential candidate and a slate of Senate and House candidates that will likely mobilise the backing of both chambers of Congress around the coming Second Marcos Administration. What now for the Opposition? I wrote just this morning that in the face of imminent defeat, they will need to change their mindset from an aggressive regard for a “winnable” battle to one where mitigation of impending losses is paramount. The Yellowtards need to let go of the delusional strategy they currently apply to their campaign where members within their comfy echo chambers assure one another of the righteousness of their “cause” (and, therefore, their entitlement to victory) and adopt more of a strategic retreat mindset. It is either that or they lose big in May 2022 — i.e., not just suffer a catastrophic loss of face and obliterate what remains of their political capital but also drag down with them the fortunes of the oligarchs who continue to foolishly bankroll their “cause” and stake the futures of their family enterprises on a Yellowtard return to power. The most powerful government in recent Philippine history is coming. People will need to decide amongst themselves which side of the equation they would like to see themselves situated over the foreseeable future. It starts with your own social media accounts. As the eminent communist “activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago observed, “after I removed myself from the Leni campaign groups, my newsfeed on FB has ceased to be pink. I took only about 10 days for that algorithm to change, and it’s an important thing to consider whenever you think, or imagine, that the numbers on our side are growing, or that there is ‘public clamor’ for anything at all. Know that algorithms make us think that, for a reason.”",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"Recall in light of the COMELEC server hacking incident...  Poll after poll over the last several years consistently showed former Senator Bongbong Marcos at the top of the popularity game — convincingly topping Robredo who supposedly beat him to the vice presidency in the 2016 elections. The most recent one, the Publicus Asia Pahayag Q3 report is particularly significant because it is the first one issued within the context of Marcos’s confirmed candidacy for president in the coming 2022 elections. The astounding 49 percent preference score BBM notched in that survey is nothing short of an absolute confronting spectre the Opposition need to come to terms with. If BBM ascends power in 2022 to become the Philippines’ second Marcos president, the destruction of the Yellowtards will be complete. They will likely be the same shrill sabotaging Opposition that they had been since 2016, but they will be a spent force seeing that their dishonest efforts to “unify” the Opposition this year actually created more enemies amongst them than friends. Several factions refused to get in bed with Leni Robredo’s and her sidekick Kiko Pangilinan’s Yellowtard bloc and their lame efforts at rebranding and recolouring their narrative, preferring, instead, to field their own candidates. The communists have now turned hostile against their now-former allies following a tiff with them over senatorial slates. Perhaps it is now time to turn the microscope over to the United States which, it seems, has a large stake in seeing the “right” politics prevail in these critical elections. At the very least, ensuring that a Marcos does not return to Malacanang is a matter of colonial pride. The US after all had a lot to do with the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Western Media were complicit in the elevation of “revolutionary” president Cory Aquino to political sainthood following that. And, now, Maria Ressa, CEO of “social news network” Rappler — a media organisation critical, by default, of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte and widely believed to enjoy CIA funds channeled via the Omidyar Network — had been awarded this year’s Nobel “Peace Prize”. The planet’s Western European and North American powers-that-be are, indeed, staring into the abyss of an acute global crisis of credibility should Bongbong Marcos become president in 2022. With their local agents — the Yellowtards, ABS-CBN, and Maria Ressa — all but botching the crush-Marcos-and-Duterte-at-ALL-costs project, America may be faced with the prospect of either (1) upping the covert intervention ante or (2) rolling up their sleeves and doing the job themselves. In what form the earlier will take, short of the latter, is anyone’s guess at this point. Then again, having suffered a humiliating and utterly messed-up retreat from Afghanistan this year, it is likely that America’s little Pacific Mini Me may be the least of their concerns for now. That too does not bode well for an Opposition desperate to win these elections. Discounting a massive American intervention this year, a glaring absence of a crooked Commision on Elections (COMELEC) technology partner and equally-crooked COMELEC head, as well as a vastly more cluey electorate we are, indeed, looking to an very interesting election in 2022. Filipinos are being told by their former colonial masters and their local proxies that a Second Marcos Presidency is, quite simply, not allowed. How much they want to make good on that directive will be revealed in the coming months. Filipinos need to get smarter and see the shameless insult to their intelligence that is the current campaign approach of today’s Opposition for what it is.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"""She can’t lead the Liberal Party yet she will be effective with the Philippines?? She can’t blame internal politics. There are none now. There was nothing to leave. How can you not hold Leni generally responsible for the Liberal Party falling off a cliff?"" I am guessing the bulk of the population already made up their mind who they are for May 2022. Yet that fact is not going to stop nauseating campaigning for all the parties and candidates. It is a fact of Filipino culture which I documented last election. There is no campaign discussed more the same way Miller Light was discussed in classic beer commercials than the Robredo/ Cuneta Pangalinan campaign.   There are better places in GRP that detail the gulf between reality and illusion. Before I live up to my click bait title , let’s go through some other reasons why the thought of Leni Robredo as our next president makes many people throw up in their mouth: Leni was responsible for the well being of the Liberal Party. That is past tense because this election there is no Liberal Party. At least in name. To show you how fast things change in politics , the Liberal Party elected a president 12 years ago . In the here and now , that president has become radioactive.   Leni Lovers  tell us the Philippines will be a paradise with her as president. Like Noynoy before her, Leni rose to prominence from necropolitics. Nothing like a death in the family to get people to care who you are so you can get votes. The Liberal Party playbook: if they didn’t notice you in life , then point to a dead relative or two. Noynoy had no contributions in the Senate or Congress, Leni had zero contributions in the courtroom. Leni’s camp tries to shake off the unintelligent label by naming honorary degrees and what her kids did. Why can’t they show videos of her making sense? Instead her campaign prefer we see videos of her doing all this. Therein  lies the rub: she was the most visible member of the Liberal Party and they imploded. She can’t lead the Liberal Party yet she will be effective with the Philippines?? She can’t blame internal politics. There are none now. There was nothing to leave. How can you not hold Leni generally responsible for the Liberal Party falling off a cliff? How is that hollow shell of a party NOT about her leadership, perseverance, competence and resourcefulness?  The fate of that party says a lot about Leni and what she is and is not about. The Liberal party disappeared because nobody there was worth it . Including Leni . Eight years ago I wrote this piece on the importance of symbols when it comes to national identity. Leni thinks simply changing her color will rid her persona of the stench of the Liberal Party. Noynoy, that complete moron only supported something the Liberal Party had total control of. Using that stupid yellow ribbon for his entire term , he was telling you the country did not matter at all. It is the symbol of the party and the interests of the party that comes before all.  Why do you think neither Noynoy or the Liberal Party stood the test of time? It is entirely comforting that Leni followed that same tactic 12 years later . Shows you why I never liked her. More than a few people agree. Mar in 2016 dubbed himself Noynoy 2.0.  He even cried when the President endorsed him before the election that year. Weird though how he was so cavalier on the ground in Tacloban during the Yolanda aftermath. He even told CNN’s audience ( there was no CNN Philippines in 2012) that  President Aquino was known as ” Pnoy”. What a stupid thing to have in your head with all the corpses and misery around him. Leni believes drugs should be decriminalized . Leni believes Manny Pacquaio would make a good president . Leni believes communist supporters should be given a seat at the table when it comes to policy making. Leni believes it is ok to publicize that her daughter was in an alleged sex video that has yet to materialize just so she can blame BBM. Leni believes it is okay to use the Lord’s altar to campaign alongside a non Catholic. Leni believes it is okay to change running mates with a month to go in the election.   Leni believes Auschwitz is a nice place for a photo opportunity. My question to you: Is it okay to believe in a person who believes all that? Leni can not avoid the Mar Roxas 2.0 stink . They were running mates in 2016 and were on the ballot as “Daang Matuwid”. A name you never hear bandied about today. Maybe because the practitioners proved to be very ineffective so they ditched the name. Anything Noynoy brought to the table since 2009-2016 is as treasured as a soiled condom. The only one who does not see it that way is Kris Aquino. Her brother has been dead almost a year and it’s only now on stage that we find out that there is an unpublished  letter from the grave vouching for Leni’s authenticity .KSP is the root of all evil. Since 2009 , Noynoy, Mar or Leni force fed you all the Liberal Party rhetoric and symbols and songs. The problem is that in the proceeding 13 years what can we point to from them and their cohorts that materialized from their yellow brainwashing?? The same stagnant signs and slogans but nothing tangible. The same people telling you to vote Leni told you to vote Noynoy. How did that work out?? How is the Liberal party doing?? The boy cried wolf too much. A long time ago San Miguel had a beer called Lager Light which went the way of the tetradactyl. Well the brand went extinct but apparently the exact same beverage changed it’s name to San Miguel Light and is the easiest beer to find in any restaurant in Manila that serves beer. I personally do not think San Mig Light  is a quality beer but it proves that things can be effectively rebranded.   Changing yellow to pink does not solve everything. It doesn’t matter what color you wear , it only matters what you are . Leni believes lightning will strike twice, that this election she will be San Mig Light going from yellow to pink. Leni of course learned from the best when it comes to necropolitics. Nobody could name one thing Noynoy ever did as a senator or congressman before August 2009. Nobody could name one thing Leni did as a lawyer prior to May 2013 . Leni back in June tipped her toe in the necropolitics pool trying to cash the cash the chips of the clueless one’s death. The house it seems is not honoring those chips and that lead to the disintegration of the Liberal Party.  Noynoy exploited his mother’s timely death. Leni would exploit Noynoy’s death if there was anything to exploit. I have laid out a plethora of reasons why voting for Leni would be insane. Personally the ultimate reason you can trust Leni as far as you can throw Franklin Drilon is the nonchalant way she looked at the events of August 18 2012. Rico Puno by all accounts was loved and trusted by Noynoy. Fact: He resigned because of a breaking and entering incident at the Manila apartment of Jesse Robredo while his plane was still missing. I doubt any of you relish your home being broken into. I also doubt any of you would enjoy the timing of that break in coinciding with a moment in time your spouse’s life is in doubt. All that is fact. Just based on the facts , I have simple questions. Others have taken the facts and have their own questions and their own conclusions. GRP’s Ramon Ortoll discussed them here. He also believes Leni to be a train wreck of a politician. Then again what good politician would align themselves with Noynoy?  Manuel “Boy” Mejorada raises his own questions when it comes to the fatal flight that took the life of Leni’s husband. Really worth the 11 minutes . Even if you disregard the interpretations, the facts open  up a can of worms:  Why the urgency on the part of trusted Noynoy henchman Puno? Did he know something about the plane at that moment that we all did not know? If something was so important , why was it not in a government office instead of a private home? Why did Noynoy not stick up for Puno? The most important question of all: if your husband’s home was immediately violated at an extremely vulnerable time would you trust the person who did the violating? Would you trust the person the boss that person was representing?? Well Leni went on to make that person her boss and was totally obedient to him. Oxford Dictionary defines vice-president ""an official or executive ranking below and deputizing for a president. "" In almost six years as vice president , she did not do her job as if she was ranking below. She looked down on the duly elected president. Leni as a vice president was not loyal to her president. Leni as a presidential candidate was not loyal to her daughter.  Leni as a wife did not seem traumatized by a fatal plane crash and a break and enter on the same day to ask the same questions I did. Her rallies make it a point to exclude the Philippine flag. Leni as candidate for president in the 2022 elections is not even loyal to her running mate. What makes you think she will be loyal to the citizens of that flag?? Epilogue We all have been exposed to the campaign tactics by Leni fanatics. Many of them Noynoy fans who never saw him as the Emperor with no clothes. Let’s go door to door, let’s belittle those that think differently and let’s disqualify the front runner. Making Leni out to be saint or in the image of the Virgin Mart or whatever. Fabricating sex scandals for the sake of slandering those they envy. I normally will not watch the Netflix show Bridgerton but I found myself paying attention to S02E02 and a quote hit me on the head like a large frying pan being held by Mike Tyson that screamed Leni campaign. ""Attempting to influence others as to the correct course of action, well, it is often a trying and irritating endeavor that only brings out the worst in us before we discover it has been fruitless all along.” It just crystalized my thoughts so eloquently on the campaign of the yellows who are now pink.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""This is the intellectual cancer that the Philippine Opposition under the leadership of the Liberal Party (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) continues to infest the nation’s politics with. Rather than encourage intellectual debate, the Yellowtards continue to stunt and poison Filipinos’ minds..."" Calling for a laban or “fight” is easy. You can see how easy it is by observing any schoolyard brawl. “Bakla ka raw sabi ni Totoy. Payag ka?” “Kalabitin mo sa titi”. “Siga ka ba? Di ka naman papalag.” Filipinos then grow up, leave the schoolyard, then go on to apply the same childish mentality to their supposedly “grown-up” politics. Recently, Philippine presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo issued the equivalent “grown-up” version of a schoolyard call-to-action by raising the long-dead Laban slogan of her long-dead political party in her latest ululation… “As your duly-elected Vice President, I took an oath to defend the Constitution. You can count on me to do everything in my power to right this wrong,” Robredo said at the Free the Courts forum at the University of the Philippines (UP) as she hit the quo warranto petition [against Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno] as the “final blow to the ideal of justice.” Robredo uses an old-fashioned (though, to be fair, still-effective) technique of mass persuasion used by demagogues of yore. (1) Jump off from a claim to administrative authority (“As your duly-elected Vice President”) (2) Style yourself as being on a Mission from God (“I took an oath to defend the Constitution”) (3) Describe said mission in nebulous terms (“You can count on me to do everything in my power to right this wrong”) (4) Put forth a “victim” that is “under attack” and therefore needs to be “rescued” (“final blow to the ideal of justice”) The fornmula is structurally the very same sort of call-to-action issued by popes and imams to launch their crusades and jihads. Whether it’s one “holy city” or the other or the name of one prophet or messiah being used in vain, the “victims” that one is called to “fight” for are often abstract or anointed with some sort of summary hallowedness that resonates with a people who would rather believe stories than think through factual options. This is the intellectual cancer that the Philippine Opposition under the leadership of the Liberal Party (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) continues to infest the nation’s politics with. Rather than encourage intellectual debate, the Yellowtards continue to stunt and poison Filipinos’ minds with the same cult of personality influence peddling around which they define their angels and demons. So, in the minds of the Yellowtards, the angels are those who live in the “heaven” of the perverse liberalism they espouse, and the demons live in the “hell” of the annoying rules that are now working against their agenda. What Robredo and her minions are waging their “crusades” over are mere business-as-usual initiatives any government worth their salt would pursue — like sanctioning businesses such as Rappler for baldly violating regulation, throwing in prison “senators” under whose watch as a former Justice Secretary drug use, trafficking, and administrative abuse proliferated in state correction facilities, revoking concessions given to “reporters” as a result of their employers’ business compliance offenses, and removing “chief justices” who are clearly not qualified to head the judiciary. That’s just plain old good housekeeping — something the shrillest of the shills who pass themselves off as the Opposition’s foremost “thought leaders” should understand at heart. Truth be told, the Opposition has not much intellectual capital to build strong counterarguments upon. Their old voodoo platform of worshipping faces on 500-peso bills had been massively discredited in the 2016 elections. They are now hard-pressed to craft a new alternative pathway to the “strongman” rhetoric of the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that continues to be popular with millions of Filipinos. Suffice to say, the Opposition have not stepped up to meet that higher challenge and are, instead, waging a reactive intellectually-impoverished guerrilla war. Indeed, guerrilla wars are romantic subjects for SOB-story “inspirational” dramas. Some may even argue that the commies won the Vietnam War using guerrilla tactics. But, see, Filipinos are not like the Vietnamese and the guerrilla cause their current Opposition are desperately recruiting for exists only in the confused minds of “opposition” leaders like Leni Robredo. What is ironic is it is the very “influencers” of this “opposition” that continuously whine about the “weaponisation” of technology for political ends. We can understand where this mentality comes from now when we behold the absolute primitive approach they take in their political movements. This is, after all, the 21st Century and it is pretty evident that the playing field has changed thanks to the very technology that these liberals once heralded as, well, “game-changing”. Funny how the more clever use of these technologies by their opponents so easily knocked the wind out of all that gushing about the new “citizen journalism”. We can see here how every word uttered by Leni Robredo reveals the intellectual bankruptcy of the Opposition she presumes to lead. The solution is therefore obvious. The Opposition need to ditch Robredo and, along with her, any trace of influence coming from the Yellowtards her face, form, and vacuous substance represents. The clock is ticking towards the 2019 elections and, soon, the next change in leadership. It is not too late for a real Opposition to emerge — if the obvious solution is considered, that is.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""We can’t even expect a statement from the faculty of the Ateneo de Manila University – Bautista’s alma mater and Liberal Party ally — to comment on his predicament since condemning his alleged corrupt activities will also reflect badly on the school."" From the moment Patricia Bautista held a press conference exposing her husband – Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman Andres Bautista’s “unexplained hidden wealth” a week ago, the public has been transfixed by the development of the issue. Most people have been left guessing and speculating on which one of the two is telling the truth.  However, the silence from certain sectors in Philippine society particularly the Liberal Party, its allies and supporters is deafening. Even a so-called “investigative journalists” don’t seem to have enough motivation to investigate the source of Bautista’s wealth. Their behaviour is hardly surprising though. Their “no comment” stance just confirms what some have suspected all along. A lot of people have long speculated that the supposed non-partisan COMELEC Chairman Bautista is allied with the Liberal Party. Now that he is under scrutiny for alleged corruption, his Liberal Party mates are most likely feeling the heat as well. Indeed, this scandal is bigger than Andres Bautista and his wife Patricia. This could spell disaster for the Liberal Party. If prosecuted for illegally amassing wealth, prosecutors could uncover evidence of electoral fraud favouring the Liberal Party candidates in the 2016 — or even earlier — elections. Allegations of vote rigging was rife even during the 2010 Presidential Elections. There are people who insist that former President BS Aquino’s win was the result of vote rigging too. Patricia Bautista’s message to the public is clear. When asked if she is aware of the implication of what she is doing, she replied that if people turn a blind eye to this revelation, everything they complain about like the horrendous traffic, instability of the economy, and unemployment among other ills that plague the country will mean nothing. After all, the people essentially lose their right to complain when, after their public servants neglect their duties yet again, they go on to elect the same public servants again and again. This is assuming that every election is clean. If there is evidence that the election was rigged to favour candidates the voters did not choose themselves, then the public should be outraged. But if they choose to shrug it off and pretend that vote rigging is okay, then they are throwing away their right to suffrage. Since that is the case, the Philippines is no longer a democracy. It is being run by the mafia – those who manipulate the result of elections. It may even be possible that they sell the votes to the highest bidder with the help of electronic voting machine provider Smartmatic and COMELEC. I’ve always said that the problem in the Philippines has less to do with the tyranny of the few, but more to do with the tyranny of the majority – those who give power to the few members of the elite. That statement is evident again with the behaviour of Filipinos who pretend that vote rigging did not happen in the previous elections even when blatant tampering was done in the middle of canvassing of votes in the 2016 Presidential Elections. Some people are in denial because they don’t want to burst their own bubble. They hold on to the belief that the Liberal Party is for the interests of the people because that has been the narrative the party’s allies in mainstream media have been telling us for more than 30 years. These people’s apathy and arrogance make them enemies of the state. I don’t know how some people can continue deluding themselves even when Bautista is already starting to show signs of inconsistencies. We can’t even expect a statement from the faculty of the Ateneo de Manila University – Bautista’s alma mater and Liberal Party ally — to comment on his predicament since condemning his alleged corrupt activities will also reflect badly on the school. They will avoid putting their own in a bad light since it will highlight the fact that the school produces a lot of crooks. Initially, Bautista said that his wife fabricated documents, but then he admits to owning several bank accounts in his subsequent statements in separate interviews with the media: ""“People know this: that there were investments made by my family with Forex. This is a problem now, I don’t know if you’ve heard of this, but it was like pyramid scheme,” he said. He added the Bautista family would answer the unexplained wealth allegations “in due time. “It is true that our family and myself have deposits with Luzon Development Bank. As to the amount, I’m not sure because I said, these bankbooks were stolen,” Bautista told ANC’s Headstart. Though the Comelec chief does not know if there were actually 32 passbooks, he explained that he had several passbooks because of the investments he had with his siblings and parents. “We had to demarcate who owns which.”"" Bautista’s inconsistencies are very telling. It’s a sign that he could be lying. He is starting to falter. He doesn’t behave like a seasoned lawyer. Why would he even admit that he and his family were into pyramid schemes? He should know that pyramid schemes are illegal in the Philippines. He is behaving more like a suspect under duress. He probably feels like everything is blowing up in his face. He is certainly coming across like a loser since he did not take care of his wife and failed to pacify her when he had the chance. The source of Bautista’s wealth is one thing – he may or may not be able to prove they are sourced legally, but it still doesn’t explain why he did not include them in his Statement of Assets Liability and Net worth (SALN).  If a former Supreme Court Chief Justice was impeached for less than what Bautista has in his bank accounts, then Bautista deserves a similar fate or, perhaps even more fitting, jail time.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""To Filipinos, after all, it’s all about people and less about ideas. To the average dilawan, Robredo is the Liberal Party and, they presume, the leader of the broader Philippine Opposition itself."" Philippine “senator” Antonio Trillanes’s epic choke during an interview with Stephen Sackur in the BBC’s HARDtalk programme last week all but highlighted the sad disarray of the Philippine Opposition. Indeed, last week was a perfect storm as it saw the coming together of insight into just how inutile the Philippine Opposition of today has become. For people who seek to prematurely depose the president (presumably with that favourite extrajudicial method of theirs that they call “people power”), Sackur’s torpedoeing of the Trillanes brand couldn’t have come at a worse time. On that same week, journalist Bea Cupin’s recent article The fall of the ‘dilawang’ Liberal Party (LP) came online viaRappler and chronicled in grinding detail the “descent of the once all-powerful party”. In light of these developments (specifically on Cupin’s article) House Representative Teddy Baguilat Jr (LP) wistfully tweeted, “What LP should do though is reflect on our mistakes and missed opportunities. And embrace our role as a fiscalizer, critical collaborator.” Interestingly, the congressman evidently recognises the core essence of the LP (presuming, of course, that it actually does represent the ideals of the so-called “liberals”) as can be gleaned from another one of his tweets… ""We’re d favorite whipping boys of critics and pundits but ultimately when forces conspire to limit our freedoms, who ya gonna call? Liberals"" Unfortunately for Baguilat, the battle cry he recommends as a response to the question “Who ya gonna call?” is not shared by members of his own camp. That’s because many in his Yellow Camp would not even know what he means when he refers to the term liberals in the true sense he applies when invoking it. Rather, to most in his camp, the answer to “Who ya gonna call?” will be a resounding LENI ROBREDO! To Filipinos, after all, it’s all about people and less about ideas. To the average dilawan, Robredo is the Liberal Party and, they presume, the leader of the broader Philippine Opposition itself. On the latter point, Baguilat agrees, “We’re [the] only organized political opposition,” he tweets in reference to the LP. Thus, in this regard, it is a monumental tragedy for the Opposition that they were sunk by Trillanes who many do not see as the leader of the Opposition. Indeed, if anybody should have been on Sackur’s hot seat, it should have been the supreme leader of the Opposition herself. But it’s not too late. Robredo could still step up and redeem Trillanes’s crushed dignity. After all, some Filipinos still want her to be president someday and see her as eminently qualified for the job. What better way to prove that she is president material than by subjecting herself to a real journalist’s grilling. What does she have to lose? She will perform way better than Duterte in any Q&A — or so the dilawans believe. The problem with Robredo, however, is that she can’t speak English. That’s a real show-stopper considering that those who defend Trillanes’s performance in the heat of Sackur’s grilling are convinced he “did well” only on the low-bar basis of his being able to “respond to all of Sackur’s questions”. In short, Trillanes’s having a rudimentary enough understanding of a question articulated in English and being able to respond to it in a way that the predominantly monolingual English-speaking audience that Sackur’s show attracts can understand is good enough. In other words, pwede na yan. Unfortunately for Robredo, her command of the English language is way below pwede na yan. Halfway through each sentence Robredo cobbles together on the fly, Sackur would surely cut her to pieces. Robredo’s colegiala act simply won’t fly in a cutthroat world of important people who have very little time. Time and again she has proven not just her verbal ineptness but her hopelessly inappropriate body language, first in the girly manner that she wrapped herself around Duterte’s finger during her first few weeks in office and in the whimsical way she presented herself in a pre-recorded video played at the 60th annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, Austria. Suffice to say, the Opposition does not only suffer from a crisis of leadership, it suffers from a crisis of competent statesmanship. This is why, for the sake of the Opposition’s future, it is important that Trillanes’s appalling snafu be redeemed. Who ya gonna call??",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Robredo is also, lest we forget, a member of the Liberal Party (LP), the out-going ruling party presided over by out-going President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III. She ran under the LP banner in partnership with its presidential candidate Mar Roxas."" At the centre of all the chatter surrounding the ascent of Leni Robredo to the office of the Vice President of the Philippines lies the question: What will be her role in the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte? The future does not look too bright for the presumptive “vice president”. Putting aside the allegations of electoral fraud and the non-compliance of the Liberal Party to Commission on Election (COMELEC) rules around the submission of the party Statement of Contributions and Expenditure (SOCE) that cloud the office of the Vice President, there is little Robredo has to offer that would be of interest to Duterte. Robredo, by her own doing, has pretty much locked herself outside of the soon-to-be-President’s circle of trust. During the campaign, Robredo had all but shot herself on the foot by by issuing evidently ill-thought-out statements that run counter to Duterte’s envisioned approach to straightening out the Philippines. Duterte, if we recall, rose to power on the back of a promise to apply more, shall we say, iron-fisted means to crack down hard on rampant criminality in the country. To that, Robredo has reportedly vowed to “lead the fight against [Duterte]” on that front. She goes further to assert… “For me, it’s going to be a huge challenge [to work with Duterte],” she admitted in an interview at the tomb of her late husband, former interior secretary Jesse Robredo, where she paid her respects before voting. “As a general rule, I think the vice president should be supportive of the President in spite of party differences. It’s your obligation to the people to work together. But there are some things that can’t be compromised. [Human rights] is one of those,” Robredo said. To be fair, where exactly “human rights” begin and where that hard crack down ends is a point of contention in Duterte’s vision. Police, after all, require justification to shoot and kill criminals under Philipine law. However, it is also difficult to justify allowing an official who had categorically expressed an intent to lead a fight “against” you into your team, specially on an initiative that had been the cornerstone of your campaign. Indeed, Robredo even cited her hometown in Naga City, Bicol where, she reportedly pointed out, local government there “were able to achieve the same results without resorting to those things”, to which Duterte responded by assuring her that his government would not interfere with Naga City’s affairs. According to Duterte… “I do not also subscribe the style of her leadership. Tabla lang kami — she does not like me, I do not like her, so no problem,” Duterte told reporters in Davao City. Robredo is also, lest we forget, a member of the Liberal Party (LP), the out-going ruling party presided over by out-going President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III. She ran under the LP banner in partnership with its presidential candidate Mar Roxas. The LP had, over the course of the campaign, sustained a vicious attack on the persons of all candidates running against its fielded bets. In the heat of the campaign, Aquino himself called for a united front against Duterte. Aquino also referred to Duterte as “a future threat to democracy”. Roxas, for his part, mounted an agressive campaign to follow-through on that messaging and, in the final stretch to election day, attempted to forge a last-ditch “unity” alliance with another rival candidate, Senator Grace Poe, presumably to combine their respective voters’ base in the hope of beating Duterte who was, by then leading the polls. Roxas reportedly described that call for unity as “a call for decency”, as if implying that Duterte’s government would be one that would be lacking in that decency. Roxas clearly harboured an intent to emotionally blackmail Poe into bowing out of the race under the assumption that her votes would go to him… In his statement made during a hastily called meeting with the press at his campaign headquarters, Roxas said that what is more important now is the future of the country than the political careers of any candidate. “Uncertainty and the specter of a dictatorship are looming over our country once again,” he said. “I call for unity, I call for decency, I call for democracy, I call for the rule of law.” So desperate was this project to win the election that President BS Aquino himself issued a statement in support of it framing the effort as “a demonstration of country before self”, essentially saying that Duterte’s presidency would be the death of Philippines. Indeed, Aquino even insisted that the prospect of a Duterte presidency “carried similar dangers to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.” Leni Robredo was, of course, a party to this vicious vilification campaign. She ran under the LP banner, took to the campaign trail with Roxas and Aquino, wore the LP’s yellow colours, and sang from the same Daang Matuwid hymn book. Perhaps someone should ask Robredo what her position is today on that vilification campaign mounted by her party against Duterte. It would be wise for Robredo’s handlers to caution her against even thinking of backpedalling from those statements of her party mates or distancing herself from the LP itself. Doing so would be a clear sign that all of what she said under the LP banner and while wearing those yellow shirts during the campaign were all lies.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez filed a case questioning the validity of the extension granted by Bautista to the Liberal Party. Nothing eventually came out of it and the winning candidates of the Liberals went on to assume the posts they won in the 2016 election, including Robredo."" The camp of Vice-President Leni Robredo was warned by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) about its crowdfunding drive for her upcoming campaign. Robredo made her announcement to run for president in the 2022 national elections last October 8. Diehard Robredo supporters have formed Team Leni Robredo as the campaign volunteer organization which runs parallel with her official campaign team headed by campaign manager former Sen. Bam Aquino. Team Leni Robredo made a public call for volunteer donations starting at P50.00 up to any amount which an individual can afford. COMELEC Commissioner Rowena Guanzon drew attention to the crowdfunding initiative because the Omnibus Election Code prohibits candidates from accepting campaign donations from foreign individuals and organizations. This includes Filipinos residing abroad who hold dual citizenship, under which definition they do not qualify because their principal residence is outside of the Philippines. COMELEC Campaign Finance Office (CFO) officer-in-charge Efraim Bag-id also flagged potential flaws in the crowdfunding drive, particularly with regard to identifying the donors. The candidates’ campaigns are required to submit a Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) within the specified period after the conduct of the election. Recall that, in 2016, the Liberal Party was late in submitting its SOCE but was given an extension by then COMELEC Chair Andres Bautista. This was unprecedented. The late submmission or non-submission of the SOCE carries with it the penalty of the disqualifcation of the candidate of the party from holding office and a perpetual ban on public office after. Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez filed a case questioning the validity of the extension granted by Bautista to the Liberal Party. Nothing eventually came out of it and the winning candidates of the Liberals went on to assume the posts they won in the 2016 election, including Robredo. Bautista went on to resign in the wake of the scandal he found himself in after his wife, Patricia, revealed dozens of bank accounts which allegedly was the fruit of payoffs Bautista received when he was the Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which is tasked with the recovery of the Marcos wealth, as well as those he allegedly received as COMELEC Chair from its automation service provider, Smartmatic. Nothing has come out of the investigation into Bautista’s case and he is in exile in the US even if the two countries have an existing extradition treaty. Robredo’s Spokesperson, Barry Gutierrez, clarified that the Office of the Vice-President (OVP) was aware of the initiative taken by the volunteers but that the funds raised would not go directly to the OVP. Where would it go then if not for use by the campaign? In the 2016 election, Robredo ran for Vice-President with the full backing of the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. While the election code also prohibits the use of government resources in the campaign, the COMELEC seldom imposes the prohibitions expressly stipulated under the law. The same is true for the Opposition political parties. The COMELEC is composed of one chair and six commissioners. They are Sheriff Abbas, Rowena Guanzon, Socorro Inting, Marlon Casquejo, Antonio Kho and Aimee Ferolino. Come February 2022, Abbas, Guanzon and Kho will be retiring and the President will be able to appoint replacements to the vacancies which results in all commissioners being appointed by President Duterte. The Opposition could use this against the administration if they don’t do well in the May 2022 polls. Coincidentally, the campaign period officially begins in February also. In the meantime, the issue of the crowdfunding drive of Team Leni Robredo remains hanging with the eventual resolution most likely being that the monies be privately consolidated and donations turned over by a qualifiied individual or entity to the OVP.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Why do Filipino voters continue to allow these communist cells masquerading as 'party lists' to put 'representatives' in Congress seats funded by taxpayers? It seems the Philippines suffers a form of national insanity..."" One of the most baffling things about the Philippines’ political landscape is the continued existence of the communists. No matter how much evidence is on exhibit proving that the communists are the leaders of the terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) and that this “army” have it as their sole mission to kill Filipino soldiers and police officers and overthrow the government, there seems to be no wherewithal in either the government or the Filipino people overall to do something about this cancer. No matter how much evidence exists to prove direct links between “legal fronts” such as Anakbayan, Gabriela, Bayan Muna, the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), and the League of Filipino Students (LFS) among many others, to this terrorism that the communists espouse, it seems Filipinos and their security forces seem pretty ok allowing these elements to roam free and spread their virulent extremist ideology. Indeed, most astonishing of all, communists have just about taken full control of campus student councils and campus “journalism” in the Philippines’ biggest and most prestigious universities. Filipino parents seem to be ok with that too. Why do Filipinos continue to tolerate these parasites? Why do Filipino parents not seem to be disturbed that communists infest their kids’ schools? Why do Filipino voters continue to allow these communist cells masquerading as “party lists” to put “representatives” in Congress seats funded by taxpayers? It seems the Philippines suffers a form of national insanity that makes its people seemingly oblivious to this massive tapeworm colony that stains their politics red from within. Presidential Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy wrote in her article “The poisoned pen of Tonyo Cruz” how Cruz and a cadre of seemingly legit Opposition “thought leaders” routinely go about building their public personas on a platform of lies — supposedly denying that they support NPA terrorism yet making no apologies about being members — even leaders — of the Communist Party’s vassal “legal” fronts. ""…you can never take away the NPA component of the CPP-NPA-NDF. The overthrow of the government through violent means is at the very core of this terrorist group. Are Tonyo Cruz, Inday Varona, Nonoy Espina, Renato Reyes,Teddy Casiño, Carol Araullo NPA members? No, they’re not. They are members of the CPP-NPA-NDF, however, and have consciously and willingly agreed to the overthrow of the government. Carol Aurallo is a central party committee member of the CPP-NPA-NDF, for instance."" Interestingly, no amount of communism seems to prevent these personalities from hobnobbing with a who’s-who of chi chi oligarchs and their political and media lapdogs. What is even more astounding is the blatantly selective nature of their public schmoozing — prefering the company of the prayerful set associated with the Opposition bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards). Hypocrisy is, of course, the least of the crimes of these communist honchos though the company they keep does raise questions around their loyalties. Are they really pro-worker? Or do these bozos turn pro-management behind the gates of the chi chi subdivisions that host the soirees they attend on weekends? Regardless of whose weddings these people grace, the fact is, they shamelessly associate themselves with parties and groups that are ok with terrorism. That’s not being woke. That’s just plain being crooked. Why so Filipinos continue to tolerate these crooks? The mystery persists. ",1

GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Whatever industries Filipinos and Chinese-Filipino industrialists put up, shut down during the post-Marcos period because of labor unrest triggered by leftist-militant groups identified with the Communist Party, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army..."" I keep wondering why everything that is wrong with this country is blamed on former President Ferdinand Marcos and current President Rodrigo Duterte and not the political bloc that was in power for thirty years since 1986. Marcos was in power for twenty-one. Duterte six. That’s a total of twenty-seven. You don’t need to have a PhD in any discipline to analyze what went wrong with the Philippine economy. You just need to read history and analyze the political structure. Yet here is PhilSTAR columnist Andrew Masigan in his piece “Clarity of need and strength of intention” telling us that “the Philippines is Asia’s sick man again after electing a Chief Executive who thought that illegal drugs was our most pressing development barrier.” ""The tragedy is that the Duterte administration failed to sustain the National Industrial Strategy. The manufacturing sector eroded since 2017, decelerating to 5.1 percent in 2018 and 3.2 percent in 2019 until it collapsed during the pandemic, contracting by -11.5 percent. Instead of further developing local industries to generate jobs, exports and wealth, this government relied on infrastructure spending (and other types of spending) to drive economic growth. It was the wrong prescription."" Marasigan should recall the Philippines’ economic history. The Spanish and American periods saw the Philippines producing coconut oil, abaca and sugar. These were the main exports. Manila then was the Pearl of the Orient. A trading outpost similar to Hong Kong with a large expatriate community of Europeans and Americans. It was a plantation-style economy which was nothing but a modern version of fief and serf in medieval Europe. The monarchy was the Catholic Church. What was not manufactured was imported. Was there an economic policy in place by the Commonwealth government? None. That was dictated by the American colonial masters. After World War II, the Americans upped and left. But they retained parity rights for their businesses and kept their military bases. Then as now, economic activities were concentrated in Luzon. Visayan and Mindanao housed the large plantations. Politicians and the oligarchs were busy rebuilding the wealth they lost during the war. Pre-war, the Philippines had no manufacturing sector. Post-war, it was the Chinese who set-up shop to churn out was viable to be produced locally. The only time an economic and infrastructure development plan was in place was after Ferdinand Marcos was elected. Post-war, the country had to deal with a communist insurgency. By the time the 60s rolled in, it was back. Then there was the Muslim separatist rebellion. Both of these were instigated by the late former Senator Ninoy Aquino. Marcos declared martial law and put forth an economic development policy anchored by the New Society — Ang Bagong Lipunan. Why did Marcos fail? Oil price shocks in 1973 and 1979 and the fact that the only lender of development funds was the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (IMF-WB) which was an American-controlled institution. It didn’t help that by 1976, the US wanted Marcos out for not renewing their parity rights and shortening the US military bases agreement shortly thereafter. Cory Aquino’s tumultuous administration was wracked by political instability, labor unrest and military adventurism. Fidel Ramos, who succeeded her, was able to restore a semblance of order. Philippines 2000 was his vision but it was rudely cut short by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Following him was Joseph “Erap” Estrada who was ousted by the ruling power bloc despite the overwhelming support of the masses which catapulted him to the Presidency. It again fell on Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) to restore order which she did, despite the fact that she was a party to the instability to begin with. We all know what happened in recent history. Think about it, there wasn’t enough monies in the economy in the 1950s that the Cojuangco clan had to borrow money from Manufacturers Hanover Bank to purchase Hacienda Luisita from Tabacalera. Whatever industries Filipinos and Chinese-Filipino industrialists put up, shut down during the post-Marcos period because of labor unrest triggered by leftist-militant groups identified with the Communist Party, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army, and its “legal” front the National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF). How can the economy grow when there is no power supply? After that came the high cost of power. All of the Marcos development plans were thrown in the garbage can. No investment in infrastructure projects. Whatever projects were there was controlled by the oligarchs. Even if foreign investors wanted to come in, they were precluded by the Constitutional limitations on business ownership. This is why our economy is consumption-driven. Demand is fuelled by overseas Filipino worker (OFW) remittances and business process outsourcing (BPO) operations. We don’t export agricultural commodities because our packaging industry isn’t as modern as our ASEAN neighbors. It was only recently that a petrochemical plant was established but its output is still short for the demand. Its convenient for people like Masigan to lay the blame on Marcos and Duterte when this is farthest from the truth. He should stick to selling popcorn which his family imports. That’s where they made their money. Popperoo. Might as well be Pooperoo given the crap he comes up with with his economic “analysis.”",1

The Opposition are shittin’ bricks over the implications of President Rodrigo Duterte being in a position to appoint people to the Commission on Elections en banc in February next year. Retiring by then are Chairman Sheriff Abas and Commissioners Rowena Guanzon and Antonio Kho Jr. and, in addition to those, there is one vacant position. Such is the chilling effect of all this on the Opposition — specially the “leading” bloc within it, the Yellowtards — that they are now calling for a “public vetting” of these appointments. This call for is unconstitutional because the Constitution already provides for duly-elected representatives to do that job. ""SECTION 18.

The Chairman of the Commission shall not vote, except in case of a tie. The Commission shall act on all appointments submitted to it within thirty session days of the Congress from their submission. The Commission shall rule by a majority vote of all the Members."" More important to note, however, is that back in the lead up to the 2016 elections, President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III and his cabal of Yellowtards were in power and guess who served as no less than COMELEC Chairman at the time — Andy Bautista. Bautista is clearly a lackey of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan. Upon his ascent to power in 2010, Aquino appointed him Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) — an agency created in 1986 by Aquino’s mother and then President Cory Aquino to hunt down cronies of “deposed” President Ferdinand Marcos. While it is clear that Bautista was a trusted lieutenant of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan during his stint as COMELEC chief, evidence of his big personal stake in the success of the Liberal Party goes even further back. According to current Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin, Bautista was also involved in Mar Roxas’s senatorial campaign as an “adviser”. Bautista was also beset by allegations of being in possession of “ill-gotten-wealth” which many suspect could have been acquired as PCGG chief and possibly as COMELEC chair. ""Patricia Bautista, the estranged wife of the Chairman of the Commission on Elections Andres Bautista, has submitted an affidavit disclosing evidence against the COMELEC chief that he has a total estimated value of almost P1 billion in money in banks, properties, interest and shares in companies established overseas that he did not declare in his 2016 Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN)."" Again, this is just another case of the selective “activism” of the Opposition who have nothing much to work with as far as a strategic vision for the Philippines beyond their traditional negative campaigning style. Like the way an empty drum makes a lot of noise and bounces up and down as it rolls down a hill, the Yellowtards are in the midst of a tililing rampage — randomly flailing over every morsel to feed their Martial Law Crybabyism and lashing out at any perceived slight against their latest hero-saint Leni Robredo. Truly a dishonest lot that one can only imagine would further set the Philippines back should they ascend power at any time in the future.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""The Catholic Church locally has allowed itself to be whored out by a desperate political party that keeps changing its name since they destroyed what they used to have."" This PM came to me the morning of March 29 2019. ""A not insignificant group of some 130 lay Christian leaders heeded the call. They organized themselves and discerned together the best senatorial candidates to support among the 62 contestants. Since 2015 these Christian leaders from the Catholic, Evangelical and Protestant persuasions have come up with GABAYKRISTO, a set of Christian criteria by which to measure the politicians. They researched the stance of the 62 candidates on various important national issues. They got the profiles of the candidates and they met several times to set up the criteria for screening the candidates. This is a serious kind of discernment circle that the bishops have been calling out. They call themselves the PEOPLE’S CHOICE MOVEMENT (PCM). They came out with two layers of screening. The first screening is to vet the candidates on two know-out issues: belief in God and federalism/charger change. They believe that a person who does not have the fear of God in him can easily abuse others. They also believe that the present state of the country is not ready for federalism and charter change. 30 candidates were eliminated on these two knock-out issues. The 32 candidates who remained in the pool were then subjected to the second screening. They were rated using criteria based on GabayKristo, a guide of 20 specific questions which are divided into four categories – Character & Honor,Competence & Abilities, Faithfulness to public service, Faithfulness to God, the Constitution and the laws. Each of the 20 questions was graded from 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. The ten candidates with the highest scores were declared the selected candidates. The following, in alphabetical order, were the selected “10 BEST SENATORIAL CANDIDATES THAT OUR COUNTRY & PEOPLE NEED DURING THESE TIMES” – – 1. Alejano, Gary 2. Aquino, Bam 3. Cominares, Nery 4. Diokno, Chel 5. Gutoc, Samira 6. Hilbay, Pilo 7. Macalintal, Romy 8. Poe, Grace 9. Roxas, Mar 10. Tanada, Erin Our lay leaders, with the People’s Choice Movement, have done their work of discernment. Now is the task for all the lay faithful to campaign the deserving candidates so as to counter the money and the political machineries that the TRAPO politicians are using.

It claims to have done the research for us and expects us to be like sheep and follow their prescription. Whatever that committee claims to be wanted those 10 people from the start. Then they came  up  with some B.S. formula to justify the 10 people they want. It is a lot like hiring a pinoy survey company. Before you finalize the rate they usually ask what do you want the survey to say and you pay them to come up with the justification of what you want the survey to said. So that famous D’Strafford survey from three years ago. The only thing new was the name. The technique was not. Look at their list . They are all silent on the following issues: None existent drug war pre 2016. Measures taken by that administration to limit the distribution of illegal drugs. Dengavaxia  ( children dying from a state sponsored vaccine) and its funding. Janet Napoles connection with the previous administration. Who should be responsible for the deaths of the  #SAF44 if anybody? What DAP was used for and what was manipulated  in order to make DAP possible? The constitutionality of DAP? COMELEC’s role in the validity of the 2016 elections.  The disappearance of Andy Bautista and funds in his possession not mentioned in his SALN. Do you know why they are silent on these issues?  They only care about issues they can blame on Duterte so that makes anything  they say personal.  Their list reeks of a personal vendetta. The Catholic Church officials are one with their candidates and have been for a long time and want you to believe these candidates have merits outside their clandestine relations. Even during the previous term 2010-2016 they mostly turned a blind eye on the sins of the administration at that time. The Catholic officials that did speak out against  the balding , bewildered, bespectacled  one were not offered main stream media coverage.   Weird how we can have truly defenseless children dying    yet this is the only evidence of the Catholic Church speaking for any kind of accountability .   Of course the list is endorsed by Bam Aquino.  He who spent his entire term cosplaying the uncle he never met who he included in his initial bid for the Senate. Bam apparently is far more academically accomplished than his presidential cousin yet shares the same lack of originality. A Google search I did using the terms ” cbcp pastoral letter fake news” produced the results above. How charming! Page 1 results are exclusively composed of Rapple, ABS CBN and the CBCP itself.  A look into the Rappler article dated June 24 2017 shows that this humble website that I have been writing for since 2012 is mentioned. The other websites they list all seem to defend the Duterte administration and nor do they  list websites fiercely loyal to the yellow cause to the point they function as attack dogs.  Funny how Rappler is not included in their witch hunt and is in fact spreading the fake news list. Rappler faces a host of charges ranging from libel, foreign ownership and tax evasion. CBCP seems to be in too much of a rush to declare certain people fake news.  If Rappler is indeed guilty of dodging local foreign ownership laws wouldn’t any of their publications by definition be fake news since they have a fake foundation? Rappler like the CBCP  mouthpieces no not hide their political agenda very well. For both of them one side is flawless and one side is eternally damned.  By favoring Rappler, wouldn’t they be in favor of media outlets who flaunt the local laws? The officials speaking for the Catholic Church go through a lot to hide their obvious bias towards the yellow movement whose last president was Noynoy Aquino. They are here to dictate to you politics not morality. They had very little in terms of public sermons for Noynoy Aquino even though he faced accusations of squandering lives and public money.  They also feel extremely offended when their punching bag punches back. This is a personal fight. The bigwigs of the local Catholic Church want you to believe it is really about following God.  I believe in God and I refuse to blindly follow some agenda filled vendetta disguised as a “work of  discernment“. The local Catholic Church is more focused on kissing up to the Liberal Party than respecting their flock as children of God.  If I was fond of blindly following people with a personal agenda who expect me to swallow their proclamations hook, line and sinker. I would read Rappler.",1

Why? He was obsessed with becoming President..."" This is an excellent proposal by one of the few objective academicians of the University of the Philippines, retired political science professor Clarita Carlos. On a Facebook post, she articulates her idea of convening a team of scholars to mount a “scientific” evaluation of the 21 years that Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines… ""Quite troubling that many among us choose only certain segments of the 21 years of Marcos’ administration but make conclusions for all of the other aspects of his administration… 1. Note that Marcos ruled the country for 21 years assisted by thousands of us who continue to live to this day; 2. I, for one, had been a consultant of PM Virata and had been one of the first trainors of the Career Foreign Service Development Program at DAP, in the early 70s; 3. If we want a scientific assessment of 21 years of his administration, then, let us compose a team of scholars who will agree on ff: a. Methodology for assessment b. Relative potencies of variables like agriculture, education, health, foreign policy, etc c. Data sources d. Data analyses 4. The results of (3) shall be made public and a series of RTDs to be conducted to give way for any and all challenges to the assessment report. Trivia: If some bright minds will again label me as pro Marcos because of my views above, you have two options: 1. Read my PhD dissertation on FM and RM2. Find a deep lake where you can drown yourself"" I hope that this initiative flies seeing that even that chi chi educational institution in Katipunan that has become a den of Yellowtardism, the Ateneo, has so far dismally failed to exhibit the same scholarship when it comes to their favourite bogeyman. Indeed, Marcos is not all good but he was not all bad either. Proof? Look at Cory Aquino’s administration! Unfortunately there aren’t many other academics who can be objective in their assessment. Why? It would debunk the narrative which has been spun for Marcos by his detractors. As Winston Churchill said “Study history, study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft.” The declaration of martial law wasn’t meant to extend Marcos’s term. He already addressed that by amending the Constitution to adopt a parliamentary form of government. With or without martial law, that would’ve been the outcome of the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Martial law was brought about by Ninoy Aquino because he meant to topple Marcos through the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Why? He was obsessed with becoming President and he wouldn’t have the opportunity for as long as Marcos was in office. Ninoy probably thought it was his birthright considering his provenance. Marcos had no provenance to speak of. He only had his brilliant mind. It is for this reason that he was cleared of the murder of Julio Nalundasan even if he was actually complicit. Jose P. Laurel thought it would be a waste of such a man if he was jailed for a crime borne out of political rivalry. The Yellows and the Reds have been having their cake and eating it too. Why should individuals who have taken up arms against government be regarded as “heroes” as they have been glorified in the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City? Why is Marcos being blamed for the lost youth of the 60s and 70s? Why can’t we move forward from Marcos and martial law? The simplest answer is it’s a convenient excuse for the failures of the Yellows and the Reds so history will not judge them as failures. It has become evident that they are fuming over the election of Rodrigo Duterte to the Presidency in 2016. This is the will of the people which they refuse to respect as they did with Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 1998. They employed the same with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) after she had a falling out with them. The Yellows and the Reds are going all-out in their vilification of Duterte and Marcos because they realize that it makes perfect sense for both to run and will likely win as a tandem in 2022, this will be the end of them.",1

Reading John Nery gush like a starstruck teenager about senatorial candidate Risa Hontiveros (Akbayan and the Liberal Party) in his recent Inquirer.net piece A Catholic vote for Risa, you could be forgiven for thinking Hontiveros is some sort of Filipino Mother Theresa. To Nery, Hontiveros is a “true child of Vatican II” and “most embodies Catholic social teaching”. Nery also cites how “A group that calls itself Catholics for Risa Hontiveros has circulated a statement online endorsing her as a Catholic candidate” noting that “[a] few of the signatories are his friends, some [he] know[s] only by reputation.” Of course, no endorsement of a candidate would be complete without a bit of pandering to certain politically-charged advocacies… ""She was, of course, and controversially, among those who led the fight for the Reproductive Health Law; what many of her Catholic critics fail to see is that it was precisely her Catholic conscience, schooled in the gritty reality of Philippine society, that moved her to join the fight."" So let me ask Mr Nery and Risa’s prayerful followers this: How does one go from being a communist (the true adherents of which are avowed atheists) to suddenly becoming a celebrated Catholic pinup? The multiple layers of confounding inconsistencies surrounding the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of the candidacy of Risa Hontiveros are too hard to ignore. Lest we forget Risa Hontiveros is chairperson of militant Leftist group Akbayan. There is scant literature on the history of the Akbayan partylist, but a GMA Network report categorically states that the roots of Akbayan along with its bitter (albeit similarly Left-leaning) rival Bayan Muna “can be traced to the division of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its allies in the 1990s. Akbayan was formed by those who refused to be associated with both factions.” But did Akbayan renounce its communist roots? According to a report published on the World Socialist Web Site, no. ""Akbayan was formed in the wake of the break-up of the Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) in the early 1990s. Every decision made by Akbayan over the past two decades has born the stamp of its origin. The nationalist, opportunist and class collaborationist politics of Akbayan are the continuation of the Stalinist politics of the CPP. What differences now exist between Akbayan and its Maoist rivals are born out of the contingencies of alliances formed with different sections of the bourgeoisie."" Interestingly, the “official” history of Akbayan as laid out in their “official” website Akbayan.org is mute on the topic of its commie roots…""After twenty years of dictatorship under the Marcos regime, formal democracy in the Philippines was restored in 1986 through a broad “people power” movement. This democracy, however, proved to favor only the political and economic elite of the country. The moving force behind the anti-dictatorship struggle–concerned citizens and progressive groups–has been relegated to the periphery of decision-making and policy implementation. In response, social movements, trade union groups, and political organizations have emerged to challenge state policies through lobbying and pressure politics. Despite the dynamism of Philippine movements, formal institutions of democracy remained in the hands of the few and the wealthy. It was within this context that the idea of building an alternative, a citizens’ political party, first emerged. Social movement groups wanted to be part of the formal processes of government. Akbayan was thus conceived as an effort to institutionalize people power and thereby deepen Philippine democracy.Consultations on the party-building project began in 1994. Throughout the country, pro-democracy groups were enjoined to help shape the party concept and strategy. Aspirations of various sectors–labor, peasants, youth, women, gay and lesbians, professionals, overseas Filipino workers, urban poor–were discussed and consolidated into a program of governance, while ad hoc structures were formed in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Four years later, in January 1998, Akbayan was formally established through its Founding National Congress. In May of the same year, the new party tested its strength by participating in the local and party-list elections and won seats in the House of Representatives, and several local government units."" Hmmmm… “conceived as an effort to institutionalize people power and thereby deepen Philippine democracy.” That, together with the euphemism that these “social movement groups” of which the founding members of what was to become AKbayan were presumably part of “wanted to be part of the formal processes of government” sounds consistent with a Third Party perspective provided by GlobalSecurity.org on what the agenda of commie movements suddenly made irrelevant by 1986 “people power” politics…  ""As a result of the world-wide known ""People Power"" revolution in the Philippines, the National Democratic Front (NDF) made a comprehensive analysis on the new situation in the Philippines. The new government was viewed as a fragile coalition of the right and bourgeoise liberals. However, the Aquino government has a broader power base than the Marcos regime. As such, it adopted a critical collaboration stance with the present government fielding some of its members to fill some some post in government. With this style they could penetrate the bureaucracy while waiting for the Aquino government to weaken so the NDF goal can be fulfilled."" In summary, senatorial candidates who trace their political roots to communism seem to have a talent for metamorphosis to suit the most current political landscape. Some remain true to these roots and present themselves for who they really are in their campaigns. Others simply sell out to the Establishment and jump into bed with the mainstream hands outstretched ready to embrace whatever sort of label and branding it will take to win. To be fair, with the enormous sums of money involved in political campaign, it will really be always all about winnability — even for ex-commies.",1

Leni Robredo got herself into another embarassing pickle again. Back on the 23rd October, Reuters published the report “Philippine vice president says time for Duterte to halt failed drug war”. Most political observers would agree that this headline pretty much sums up Robredo’s position on the matter. In a subsequent statement translated to English by Interaksyon, however, Robredo seemingly denied taking such a position… ""It’s hard… because headlines are sending another message. For example, I saw headlines that claim I called the drug war a failure so it should be stopped. “If you review the interview, I said something else. If you look at it, what I said what the government should assess if the counternarcotics strategy being used is still right. Because it isn’t, it should be tweaked. Isn’t that to ‘tweak’ means to massage, to shift it a bit.” Even translated into English from her native Taglish, Robredo’s statement comes across as utter jibberish. She has long been known for her lack of eloquence and her public statements have been consistently inarticulate resulting in much confusion. Reuters, for its part, stands by its story. “Reuters fairly and accurately represented the statements of Philippine vice president Leni Robredo, and we stand by our story,” Reuters Asia Pacific Communications Manager Tyler Thia said. The problem with the Opposition, however, is not Robredo but its core community of Yellowtards — partisans loyal to the Liberal Party led by Robredo and the Philippines’ powerful Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan. Despite the lack of intelligence evident in the “vice president”, the Yellowtards continue to latch onto every word that leaves her mouth that then gets immortalised on the pages of the Philippines’ top newspapers. Such rabid loyalty to an obviously incompetent and unintelligent official is what is behind the inbred nature of the Opposition rhetoric. It’s time the leaders of the Opposition take stock and re-evaluate their choice of leaders.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"""The fact is, there is no evidence that these 'sex tapes' actually exist. Even if they do, they are unlikely to be authentic as it does not take much nowadays to create and spread deep fake videos..."" The week has barely started and the Yellowtards have cooked up a new outrage fad. The venerable Philippine Star “reports” on this dubious subject today in its article “Robredo camp slams sex tape allegations involving daughter, urges supporters to ‘hold the line’”. Note, however, the use of the term “allegations”. What then is the Robredo camp “slamming” then? What are they calling on people to “hold the line” against? Looking into the article itself, we find out that these are not even allegations per se but mere “rumors of an alleged sex video involving one of the daughters of Vice President and presidential candidate Leni Robredo”. PhilSTAR, it seems, is not reporting news. It is “reporting” the cries of bloody “victimhood” that Robredo, her daughters, and the entire Yellowtard Camp are now filling social media with. Evidence of this familiar modus operandi is all there in the PhilSTAR article which “reports” the whole point of this latest circus being all about pinning the blame on “[accounts] supporting the campaign of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late ousted dictator who is also running for president.” What evidence do they cite that supports this rather hasty conclusion? Nowhere in the article is the answer to this simple question revealed. The lack of any verified evidence that all this noise constitutes a legitimate issue that deserves to be taken seriously evidently did not stop a who’s who of Yellowtard honchos from issuing their two-cent ululations on the matter. PhilSTAR “reporter” Franco Luna does his part and uncritically amplifies it in his “report” as he does quoting a recent tweet from Yellowtard senatorial candidate Chel Diokno… ""Ito ang latest script ng kabila, targeting the daughters of VP Leni. Alam nating desperado na sila dahil sa paglakas ni VP, but it takes a special kind of evil to resort to misogynistic attacks against the kids. Ito ba ang uri ng pulitika na gusto natin para sa ating mga anak?"" Interestingly enough, the tweet seems to have since been deleted. It is, however, easy to see in the way Diokno worded his tweet that the aim was to use this latest circus as a platform to demonise administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who are leading the race by an effectively insurmountable margin. By now, however, this latest Yellowtard lie seems to be spreading. One culprit is a certain Dr. Gia Sison who uncritically (true to Yellowtard form) takes a “stand” to “defend” the Robredos in a tweet despite not enjoying the benefit of any verification that these sinister conspiracies to disrespect the Robredo family are actually true. What does spreading a lie make one? Well, logically that would make one a liar too.",1

Aika Robredo, daughter of Opposition Yellowtard presidential candidate and current “vice president” Leni Robredo finds herself yet again in the midst of another media circus. An old tweet of hers had surfaced that seems to have been fielded at the time woke hashtag #EveryWoman was “trending” on social media. The tweet very likely makes reference to a purported sex video “scandal” then Senator Leila De Lima was allegedly involved in and this tweet of Robredo very likely was made to jump on the bandwagon of expressing “solidarity” with the disgraced senator. Curiously, the tweet which would have been accessible here seems to have been deleted. Speculation is now running rampant over why Ms. Robredo would delete what seems to be a tweet made in the context of a fashionable woke activist movement at the time. Indeed, Abigail Valte who served as Deputy Presidential Spokesperson for the late former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III was one of the bozos who jumped onto this “trending” bandwagon, issuing the same scripted tweet. Evidently, being a fashionable sort of tweet at the time, woke Yellowtards had been busy parroting the same text all over Twitter — which all the more makes mysterious Ms. Robredo’s motives for deleting the tweet. It is possible that this deletion followed a recent outrage fad seemingly concocted by the Yellowtards this week to arm them with yet another Victim Card to exploit for political gain. Indeed, this stunt was one enthusiastically amplified by Yellowtard-controlled Big Corporate Media… ""Nonetheless, it is not just PhilSTAR that is amplifying this latest Yellowtard-created circus. The Philippines’ biggest media organisations have themselves jumped on the bandwagon. In “Robredo camp mulls legal action over malicious video”, CNN Philippines quotes Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas who screeches “This is a cheap, sexist online attack meant to demean women and to distract the public from VP Robredo’s crusade for good governance, health-based pandemic response, and people’s welfare”. The Inquirer puts in its own two-cent piece on the matter in “Leni Robredo on hateful attack vs daughter Aika: Stay focused, fight it with truth” which it closes by pointing out that “fact-checker Tsek.ph said that Robredo is the biggest victim of negative misinformation, while her opponent in the 2016 vice presidential polls and in the upcoming 2022 national elections, Bongbong Marcos, is the beneficiary of positive but misleading messages on social media.” Imagine our shock over this “revelation”, right?"" Lack of conviction is evidently what is sinking these elections’ Opposition campaign. Filipino voters are seeing through the consistent inconsistency of the ideological foundations of the Yellowtard “cause”.

If this is how she is now, do you still think that she’s fit to be President...""As of today, the Opposition continues to be in a state of flux. Vice-President Leni Robredo finally came out with a statement about the consecutive setbacks her “unification” efforts suffered with the announcement of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao and Isko Moreno that they’d be running for President. The supporters were also dazed and confused. Wasn’t former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio’s coalition 1Sambayan tasked with the purpose of unification? What happened? Etta Rosales said they were split on Robredo and Isko but they would make an announcement on September 30 after survey results were in. Huh? 1Sambayan’s credibility has been put to question because of the non-transparent selection process and the unanswered question of who died and made them god? Meantime, the Vice-President voiced her “heartbreak” about her seeming failure while continuing to justify the delay in her final decision. This, despite the fact that she categorically stated that she would run if only to prevent a Marcos from ascending to the Presidency or six more years of the kind of governance the country “couldn’t take anymore”. The leader of the Magdalo Group also pressed her for an answer. If she won’t run, then Antonio Trillanes was prepared to take her place because the genuine opposition was what the people need and not the “Duterte-enablers” who have declared. Interestingly, Isko was laying big fat eggs beginning on the day of his announcement continuing throughout the end of the week. Pac-Man wasn’t heard from until the yesterday when he said he was in favor of “unification.” Apparently, he met with the 1Sambayan convenors even while Robredo was busy trying to “unify” the opposition. So the operative questions became: Who was actually talking to whom at what point? How could they unite if the two others have declared while Robredo was still dilly-dallying in her Quezon City office? In the meantime, her loyalists were busy taking potshots at Isko on social media since he was the latest object of their disaffection with his announcement. Foe its part, Opposition “social news network” Rappler also made a mess by releasing the latest trust and approval ratings of the President. The first version had it at an all-time high which it promptly corrected to suit its propaganda that it sunk to an all-time low of 62%, which is actually the highest for any post-Marcos President and this in the midst of the pandemic where his administration has been criticized to no end by the opposition. Dick Dastardly would probably come after Muttley already with his drats and double drats with this development! They have been at it for five years now with the same result. It’s simply not working. The President signed his Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance (CONA) as the Vice-Presidential candidate of PDP-Laban. Reporma Chair Sen. Ping Lacson was swearing in new members and signing their respective CONAs as well in preparation for the filing of certificates of candidacy which begins next week. Opposition political analysts continue to label the NPC-Reporma Presidential bet as “Duterte-enabler” while also expecting him to give way to a common candidate once they get their act together. What I do know is while the Opposition has been running around like a headless chicken seemingly unaware of whether or not politics is addition or subtraction, the administration, NPC-Reporma and Aksyon Demokratiko have been adding to their ranks. Robredo is like Nero fiddling while Rome burns or Wendy in Peter Pan who can’t ever figure out what she wants to do. If this is how she is now, do you still think that she’s fit to be President given how she fails at consensus-building and lacks the cognitive ability for the need to make decisions in a timely and orderly manner?",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"""All that these rallies really prove is that Yellowtard supporters are willing to dress in their pink best, get on a chartered bus, and scrunch together in a rally at the beck and call of their 'leaders' on a Sunday afternoon."" From what started out as an estimated 80,000-strong crowd before sunset yesterday, the “official” estimate issued this morning (and amplified by mainstream media) ballooned to 137,000. In its “report” on the event, Inquirer “reporters” Jeannette I. Andrade and Krixia Subingsubing further bumped up the estimate to 180,000. As expected, most participants in this rally wore pink — a reminder that theirs is an exclusive club of partisans who identify with a political brand. This latest “show of force” was impressive — impressive in how it demonstrates the resolve of a beleaguered political camp to send across to the public an unfounded perception that they are “winning”. But are the Yellowtards actually winning? This is the more important question. How many voters are the Yellowtards actually converting? The most recent reports on voter preference polls issued by reputable research firms show that administration tandem Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte continue to maintain a formidable — very likely insurmountable — lead over the rest of the Opposition candidates. Pulse Asia, reporting off the results of a survey conducted over the 18th through the 23rd February showed Marcos and Duterte attracting 60 and 53 percent of survey respondents’ preferences respectively. Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo attracted a measly 15 percent while Opposition vice presidential candidate exhibited a more respectable 24 percent of respondents. The recent Publicus Asia Pahayag report made use of an even more recently-collected sample acquired over the period 9th through the 14th March. This period would have likely captured any change in voter sentiment accounted for by successful Yellowtard rallies conducted then. The fact is, however, there is no evidence that the proverbial needle had moved. The more recent Publicus report remains generally consistent with the Pulse Asia numbers with Marcos and Duterte attracting 55 and 56 percent of survey respondents’ preferences respectively. All that these rallies really prove is that Yellowtard supporters are willing to dress in their pink best, get on a chartered bus, and scrunch together in a rally at the beck and call of their “leaders” on a Sunday afternoon. As to the number of non-Yellowtards who would suddenly experience a miraculous change of preference and express this by doing the same? There is no reliable way of measuring how many people fit that story. In short, it is only a fool who would conclude on the bases of these “shows of force”, impressive as they may be, that voters are being won from rivals. More importantly, the manner with which the Yellowtards are trying to win over voters is intellectually-dishonest. All of what they contribute to the national political chatter are no more than appeals to emotion. The colour, crowds, and, notably, the celebrities who perform for free at these rallies are targeting only one thing — an emotional response. Even this far into the campaign, the Yellowtards would be hard-pressed to articulate clearly what their “movement” even stands for. They proclaim themselves Filipinos’ “champions of democracy”, yet show no evidence that said democracy is even being threatened to begin with. They claim on one hand to to be “in solidarity” with gay people and feminists yet, on the other, schmooze with the conservative Roman Catholic Church whose members and honchos are dogmatically opposed to both. These bald inconsistencies are likely at the root of why a strong colour branding is being used in this campaign — to distract Filipinos to the vacuousness and dishonesty of Yellowtard ideology. With just a little more than 40 days to go in the campaign it looks like rallies like these are all the Yellowtards really have to show the Filipino voter. Anecdotes of members of their lot “converting” their parents, their driver, their maids, and even their own children are being exchanged in Yellowtard echo chambers. But if the polls are to be believed, even if all the rest of the Opposition candidates stand down from their candidacies and back Robredo as a “unified” force, Marcos would still enjoy a comfortable lead. And if they lose these elections? There are indications that they have already thought that far ahead. One cannot put it past them to incite rumblings of another “people power revolution” that they hope would result in an illegal change in leadership. The Yellowtards, quite simply, feel entitled to an electoral win this year as they are of the strong belief that God himself is on their side. For the sorts of people who think that way, any means justify the end.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"""Bongbong Marcos does not have to campaign any further. The Yellowtards are doing that work for him."" T-minus 2.5 months. The Philippine Opposition have abandoned all pretense of a positive campaign and are all-hands-on-deck mounting a demolition campaign against their common “enemy” of this brief moment, administration presidential and vice presidential candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte. It is an interesting exercise considering the Opposition bring to bear methods and information they have been using since the late 1970s — allegations that the Marcoses are thieves, that they are murderers, that they are liars, and that they oversaw an “unprecedented” decline in the Philippines’ economic fortunes. Considering the age and bluntness of the “weapons” of demolition they wield in this homestretch, it continues to baffle most sensible observers how Opposition purveyors of these methods are able to expect their political fortunes to change for the better. The major Opposition bloc, now effectively composed of Leni Robredo’s Yellowtards, Nery Colmenares’s communists, Big Corporate Media, and the Roman Catholic Church (the latter two effectively the Philippines’ biggest and wealthiest political parties), have for so long been drumming up the “Evil Marcos” narrative. But have they drummed that story in successfully? In actual fact, they have. Every single Filipino is aware of all that the Opposition have been screeching about with regard to that Evil Marcos narrative. Indeed the public consciousness is saturated by it. Members of Marcos’s formidable base of committed supporters are very likely even more familiarised with this Evil Marcos narrative than the Yellowtards and commies themselves. You wonder then who the Yellowtards and commies are preaching to? What new information are they delivering? They have been investing so much of their meagre brains and precious time to this exercise — to the extent of neglecting building any sort of intelligent platform — that it leads us to wonder if they have, at any point, stepped back and taken stock of any returns on that dubious investment. The Opposition to date offer nothing transformative or visionary to Filipinos. Several “presidential forum” media circuses organised in rapid succession over the just the last two to three weeks have so far achieved nothing other than to exhibit the vacuous nature of the collective Opposition pitch to the Filipino people. Tired old pandering to “the poor” are all we get from the Opposition nuisances. What do they propose is the path to building a strong and great nation? We don’t know yet. But, hey, they still have two months and a half to tell us. More importantly, the way the Opposition are desperately posturing over the remaining days of the campaign have only proved one thing — without Marcos in the picture they essentially have nothing much to work with. This is made readily-evident just by a quick peruse of the social media timelines of just about every Yellowtard and commie Netizen — from their most lowly troll to their chi-chiest Katipunan-educated “thought leaders”. Marcos this and Marcos that. Small wonder that these bozos routinely all go tililing whenever Marcos declines an invitation from their most revered “journalists”. A media circus is not a media circus unless a Marcos graces the occasion. Bongbong Marcos does not have to campaign any further. The Yellowtards are doing that work for him. If the Yellowtards and commies insist on continuing their negative campaign, they should at least apply a bit more originality and imagination to their effort. At least tell Filipinos something they don’t know. Perhaps it is about time the Opposition consider what they had long convinced themselves to be unthinkable — that Filipino voters are making truly informed choices on who to support in the coming elections and that they should regard these choices respectfully for a change. For now, if they truly believe they are the “good guys” in this “fight” they tell us we are in the midst of, well, that narrative is proving that it has come down to them competing with an “evil thief” of their own fashioning and are losing.",1

In his Manila Times column today, former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao handily sums up the challenge the Opposition need to step up to in order to “whittle away” (in the words of The Noted One) the enormous lead of administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos. How to make the dumb Yellowtard presidential candidate appear smart? That is the million-dollar question. It’s time Robredo pull the biggest feat of transformation of her career. She has, after all, gone through many wardrobe changes over the last several years and the time has come for the fat lady to sing (pardon the pun). To be fair, erasing the Dumb from her personal brand will be a monumental challenge, specially over such tight time frames. This is, after all, a perception that was many years in the making. There is no need to go into the detail to grasp the vast foundation of dumbness upon which the Robredo brand had been propped. Fundamental to all this is Robredo’s inability to string together a statement in straight English. This trait alone is the single biggest indicator of just how dismal her cognitive faculties are. It gets worse. Robredo is surrounded by stupid people. This is evident in the incoherence and downright kabaduyan (campiness) of her campaign. To begin with, Robredo was dumb enough to allow a motley group of supporters to cobble together a “grassroots” campaign for her. One wonders if it was plain laziness to fail to step up to the role of Chief Architect of one’s own campaign or just a bad case of a total lack of vision or, at least some imagination, to apply to the craft of strategic planning. Whatever it is that was behind this massive failure of leadership, it is clear that Robredo oversaw an astounding amateurish desperate trial-and-error campaign management fiasco. That, folks, was dumb. How then can DUMB be fixed in three months? Even if the Yellowtards had an infinite bucket of money to throw at this challenge, it is hard to imagine how such an untenable problem could be solved. No, it is not just untenable, it is an intractable problem. Perhaps if we translate that latter word to Tagalog, Robredo and her Yellowtard followers will be better able to grasp just what a big problem this is: hindi magkandaugaga. Plain and simple, there’s just no solution that adds up to solving the problem of just how stuck the dumb perception is to the Robredo political brand. What then? How does one proceed from here? That’s a difficult question — probably a good one the next presidentiables interviewer should add to her list of questions to ask Robredo. There are a couple of guiding principles for a good interviewer — one who has the balls to ask those questions — to keep in mind when listening to Robredo explain what she plans to do in the remaining three months of the campaign: (1) Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. (2) You cannot solve a problem using the same thinking that created it. Does it take a “Peabody Award” or a Nobel “Peace Prize” to ask the right questions when interviewing politicians on a desperate campaign trail? Absolutely not.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Duterte and Marcos are seen by many Filipinos as leaders who offer a roadmap that could see the Philippines return to the stoic disciplined meritocracy it once was."" Filipinos are coming to terms with the political reality underlying the presidential race today. Following the EDSA “revolution” in 1986, the pendulum had swung too far out the side of ultra-representative “democracy” in the Philippines. As a result, the deeply disturbing reality of the true nature of the way Filipinos have squandered their “freedom” has all been revealed. Rather than apply a mature discipline and sense of accountability in the way they exercise their democratic freedoms and rights, Filipinos have, instead, used their freedom to turn their country into a sad global punchline. It is hardly surprising. Politicians who are products of the popular vote reflect the character of their constituents. So if, now, Filipinos lament the banal thievery of their government officials, the mediocrity in the thinking applied to development goals, and the incompetence of their top leaders and sovereigns, the highways of blame lead nowhere else but back to themselves. Indeed, the culmination of the culture of worshipping the notion of “sacrifice” that Filipinos have perverted beyond all recognition and, on the back of this, the favour bestowed on politicians who pander singularly to this perverse rule of “sacrifice” is no less than current President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III, son of the late former President Corazon ‘Mrs Sacrifice’ Aquino. Something’s gotta give. And evidently something has today. After three decades of emo governance, sacrifice platforms and mediocrity agendas have been pitched once too many to Filipinos and now two politicians representing the antitheses of bakla politics have emerged as serious contenders — Rodrigo Duterte and Bongbong Marcos. As compelling challengers to the no-results victim-mentality-pandering campaigns that dominated presidential elections over the last 30 years, Duterte and Marcos are seen by many Filipinos as leaders who offer a roadmap that could see the Philippines return to the stoic disciplined meritocracy it once was. Indeed, none of the other candidates offer any semblance of a vision to begin with. Administration candidate Mar Roxas, for one, is seen to be no more than a sad compromise for the once-venerable Liberal Party. The Daang Matuwud (‘straight path’) doctrine that started out as a campaign catchphrase of BS Aquino back in the 2009 campaign has long been tainted by the incumbent administration’s bald six-year-long reign of hypocrisy. Under the Aquino administration, pork barrel thievery was perpetrated at unprecedented scales and appalling human rights abuses were not only tolerated but sanctioned by Malacanang. Indeed, BS Aquino has been slammed by no less than the United Nations for his human rights abuses thanks to the efforts of international lawyer Amal Alamuddin who earlier this year brought the case of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the UN High Commission on Human Rights Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) which recently ruled that her detention under the Aquino regume was “arbitrary” and, therefore, unwarranted. ""In her e-mail [to her Filipino lawyer, Lorenzo Gadon], Clooney said the UN body found Arroyo’s detention arbitrary and illegal because “the Sandiganbayan failed to take into account her individual circumstances, failed to consider measures alternative to pretrial detention, and because of undue delays in proceedings against her.” The WGAD also found her detention “politically motivated” because her confinement was due to “her exercise of her right to take part in government and the conduct of public affairs” and “because of her political… opinion,” Clooney said. She reported that the UN body underscored the Aquino administration’s decision to stop Arroyo from traveling in November 2011 in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to seek medical treatment for her neck and spine illnesses."" But Aquino one-upped all his predecessors by upping the ante of criminal rule. The possibility of President BS Aquino dabbling in high treason may also be emerging. Investigators both in the Philippines and in other countries may already be in the process of piecing together the puzzle of what exactly was behind the involvement of embattled Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in Aquino’s controversial Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) project. Left to the devices of BS Aquino and his shadowy partnership with Kuala Lumpur, a vast chunk of Mindanao would have been carved out and handed over to the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front which at one time or another in its history had been funded in various capacities by the Malaysian government. And what do detractors of Duterte and Marcos deliver in the way of intelligent arguments in light of all of the above? Predictable ones. They cater mainly to the tired old assumption that Filipinos continue to harbour an irrational fear of a return to the bad old days of “authoritarian” rule. In the case of Duterte, it is his track record of turning the southern Philippine city of Davao into a model metropolis with an iron-fisted leadership style that is admired by constituents and condemned by the chattering classes of Imperial Manila up north. As for Bongbong Marcos’s detractors, the epic tantrums they are throwing over his recently-announced candidacy centres around just three quaint points: (1) He is the son of former President Ferdinand Marcos. (2) He and his family should return their “ill-gotten wealth” first. (3) He may declare martial law again during his term. But is there anything else beyond these? (sound of chirping crickets in the background) Specifically, is there anything about the possibility of seeing a Marcos Vice Presidency that one can argue against that has something to do with how he might actually perform his duties during his term? Unfortunately, Filipinos are known for their inability to think that far ahead and focus on relevant arguments that pass the So What? Test. This can be gleaned when one closely examines the nature of their support for the other presidential candidates. The support for these candidates is underpinned by shallow ideas lacking in substance. The thinking is focused on concepts of “honesty” (i.e. lack of a history of “dishonesty”, for one), “sacrifice”, and none much else. Instead of true platforms these politicians exhibit mere lists of issues they promise to “tackle” if elected all of which do nothing but insult the already meagre intelligence of their supporters. In contrast to the rest of the uninspiring presidential candidates, Duterte and Marcos do offer something different — an alternative to the idiotic dogma of the Yellow rhetoric that dominated Philippine politics for 30 years. All it takes is a bit of imagination to think outside the square that has framed the Philippine political “debate” over the last several decades. It is time Filipinos think beyond their girly fear of “martial law”, their infantile aversion to disciplined governance, and their lazy habit of substituting modern logical thinking with a fixation on political superstition.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Bolet Banal 'would arguably be—if President Duterte were to step down before his term expired in 2022— the most powerful man in the country, as he would be the last person Robredo would talk to at the end of each day'."" Members of the Philippine Opposition are coming to the defense of their “hero” and presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo following a column by writer Bobi Tiglao published on the Manila Times today. According to Tiglao, Robredo has so far failed to confirm or deny whether she is having an affair with House representative of Quezon City’s third district, Jorge (“Bolet”) Banal who is married. Both Banal and Robredo have, according to Tiglao so far refused to comment or give a straightforward answer to reporters’ requests for comment. ""In media convention, or simply out of sheer rationality, a refusal to confirm or deny a report is interpreted as a confirmation, unless it is preposterously baseless, or is predicated on a falsehood."" The main argument of Robredo’s supporters is that this is none of the Filipino public’s business. However, as Tiglao points out, this is an issue of national consequence considering that Banal “would arguably be—if President Duterte were to step down before his term expired in 2022— the most powerful man in the country, as he would be the last person Robredo would talk to at the end of each day.” More importantly, Robredo routinely exhibits her devoutness to her Catholic faith in public displays of piety much of which is conveniently staged in front of reporters’ cameras. But the most pious of the Roman Catholic faithful frowns upon liberal expression of one’s sexuality and engaging in sexual acts outside of marriage. As such, given the public persona Robredo cultivates for her and her party’s poltical ends, her alleged relationship with Banal, an illicit one within the frame of the Catholic faith if it has been consumated, is a matter of consequence to her constituents. When one openly exhibits religiosity, the increased scrutiny into one’s private life is par for the course. This is the reason sex scandals involving religious leaders and the pious are such lucrative fodder for the media — because people just love stories about the pious and the judgmental falling from grace. The question Robredo therefore needs to answer if she insists on not “humouring” the matter of her alleged affair with Banal is why. Why is it important that she keep her relationship (or lack of relationship) with Banal a secret? Is it because Robredo is afraid of being judged? Does her value as a politician and public servant rest entirely on her ascendancy as a devout Catholic? What does this say about her regard for ordinary Filipinos who are also in a similar situation? Does she presume to judge people who may be in such a situation? As the presumptive second most powerful Filipino, it is telling the way Robredo shrinks from the responsibility of being forthright to her constituents about her personal life. As a public official and personality, Robredo should recognise that with that role comes responsibility of ensuring the consistency the public expects of a leader. In Australia, a scandal involving the extramarital affairs of former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce sparked a similar debate on how much the media should be reporting about the personal lives of public figures. The principles at stake at the centre of this debate are no different… ""In politics, convention has long been that there needs to be a public interest, such as a misuse of public money involved, for an affair to be deemed newsworthy. Or when there is a rank hypocrisy that begs to be exposed. An MP who moralises about the sanctity of marriage and family values, while philandering on the side, is a ripe target."" Clearly, Leni Robredo fits the mold of the latter. She needs to face the confronting question once and for all. Indeed, though her most vocal supporters prefer that she dismisses these speculations, it is quite likely that much of the interest around this aspect of her personal life comes from within her community of supporters. After all, it is her supporters who are the biggest stakeholders in how consistent Robredo’s practices are to what she preaches.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""Robredo and her camp are very quiet about the woman troll who threatened to 'plant' bombs during a pro-Duterte rally and who also planned to assassinate Duterte if the impeachment bid against him doesn’t succeed."" Women who use The Woman Card – the act of claiming they are being victimised because of their gender – so liberally are disappointing and do not help advance the real issues rational women are fighting for. One woman who quite often use The Woman Card is current Vice President Leni Robredo. She claims that today’s world is not safe for women anymore: ""Attacks and harassment on social media, including threats of rape and bodily harm, are just as painful as attacks in real life. But on social media, we are a lot more vulnerable. Safety and protection are a lot more difficult to find in the digital arena."" While I don’t condone “threats of rape and bodily harm”, Robredo made it sound like it was only women who receive violent threats online. There are actually men from the pro-Duterte supporters who have received death threats from rabid Liberal Party supporters. One person who was publicly threatened on Facebook was public prosecutor Darwin Cañete. Someone threatened to enter Cañete’s home and massacre his whole family recently. The troll even posted Cañete’s home address for everyone to see and yet Cañete did not cry foul and claim to be a victim of gender inequality. He just went straight to the process of prosecuting the troll who made the threats. That is not something we can say about Robredo. It seems all she does is complain about her critics online and cry foul that she is being unfairly persecuted. Never mind that she produced a video persecuting President Rodrigo Duterte and the members of the Philippine National Police for the world see in the hope that the European Union and United Nations would do something to topple the current government. Robredo did not realise that there are also women in the police force and by maligning the agency, she inadvertently put everyone, including the female officers, in a bad light. There are women and men who work tirelessly and quietly, but Robredo lumped them all with the others who are supposedly rotting the system. It seems both men and women are not safe against Robredo’s speculative and reckless remarks. What’s unfair about this sorry situation is Robredo is the one crying foul after she received backlash from the public after she painted a very bad picture of the Philippines to the international community. She made it look like the country has become the wild, wild West – where people cannot walk the streets safely anymore. Her picture is far from the result of the latest survey that found that 82% of Filipinos feel safer with the ongoing Duterte government’s war on drugs. Speaking of trolls, Robredo and her camp are very quiet about the woman troll who threatened to “plant” bombs during a pro-Duterte rally and who also planned to assassinate Duterte if the impeachment bid against him doesn’t succeed.  “LYN Ouvrier threatened to bomb the Luneta on April 2, and swore to plot the assassination of President Rodrigo Duterte in the event that the impeachment complaint against him does not prosper. She thought she could get away with this. She is dead wrong. Lyn Ouvrier is not her true name. It is an alias that she uses as she inflicts her vitriol on Duterte supporters. Lyn is also a certified Leni troll. In fact, she is even willing to commit a crime in her name. After all, only a loyal and committed follower would publicly state this in Facebook: “We are going to plant bombs at the Luneta Park on April 2nd, 2017 in order to protect the Vice President and disrupt the rally to be organized by fanatics of Duterte.” It is strange that she can label supporters of the President as fanatics, without thinking that only fanatics would plant bombs in a rally to protect a public figure. In fact, people who would do so are not just fanatics, but are also terrorists.” A woman terrorist is not good for women’s image, indeed. Robredo should be outraged. It shouldn’t matter that the troll is her supporter, what matters is Robredo should help fast-track her prosecution because the troll is willing to murder people for her ideology. While Robredo is claiming that women are not safe in today’s world anymore, the truth is, Filipinos are not safe while Robredo is in power because she is using her position to destabilise the Philippines and she is inspiring her supporters to harm innocent people. During a radio interview with commentator Ted Failon, Robredo admitted that she asked herself “What have I gotten myself into?” Damn…the public including her supporters should ask her why she ran for the Vice Presidency in the first place if she didn’t know what she was getting herself into. Did she think it was going to be peachy being in the second most powerful position in the land? Did she expect everyone to agree with her views all the time? She must have been in a daze when she was campaigning – intoxicated by all the attention from the Liberal Party supporters who deluded themselves into believing she was the second Cory Aquino. If only Robredo listened to her own daughters who begged her not to run for Vice President. They had more wisdom than her to foresee (in that instance) they would be embroiled in the bitterness of politics the higher up the food chain you go. In her attempts to blame others for her current woes, Robredo also admitted in the same interview with Failon that she sometimes blames her dead husband, former Department of Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Jesse Robredo, for the situation she is in. She said that if he hadn’t died, she would never have entered politics. She inadvertently admitted that her motivation is not to serve the people, but to continue the so-called “legacy” of her late husband. And you might ask, what legacy? There are people close to the Robredos who are coming out now saying that Jesse wasn’t as squeaky clean as his supporters claim him to be. But these are all loose talk by people who want to remain anonymous online. You also wonder why they didn’t come out with the “truth” prior to the election. That could have helped bring down Robredo to earth. Instead, we have to deal with a Vice President who is so delusional to think that she is the answer to the Philippines’ problems. In another speech during the Belle du Jour Women’s Summit, Robredo encouraged women to “speak the truth all the time”. She should follow her own advice and stop lying to the people. She should start backing her claims with facts and stop denying her own statements when critics are calling her out for spreading false information. It is kinda depressing to watch Leni speak in public. She lacks charisma and wisdom. It’s hard to imagine how she got the VP post without foul play and it’s even harder to imagine her as the President just in case. The only thing going for her is her skill at playing the woman/victim card. The fact is, Robredo is adding to the division in Philippine society. After releasing unsubstantiated claims, she would then spend a lot of time defending herself from critics like the time she denied that she said there were more than 7,000 victims of extra-judicial killings due to the war on drugs, which contradicts the PNP’s much lower figure of over 2,000. Robredo also insisted that she wrote a letter to the DILG and the PNP asking about the palit-ulo scheme — a letter that PNP Chief Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa denies he had received. The letter she showed the public did not even state she was inquiring about the palit-ulo scheme. Instead of apologising for her errors, Robredo stubbornly sticks to her guns and denies them even when what she said was on record. It goes to show that she is more concerned about her image and her ego than serving the people. This is not just bad for the women she claims to represent; it is bad for the entire population of the Philippines.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com,"""In terms of production quality, scale of organisation, and overall pizzaz, the performance delivered by Team BBM-Duterte outclassed all the rest. As many in the audience observed, ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga was in her element as host of the event.""  Yesterday’s campaign kick-offs again made the writing on the wall even more evident with the clear topping of the shows of the day by administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who “rocked” a packed Philippine Arena. Even communist “journalist” Inday Espina Varona was moved to admit, “[in] terms of numbers, the son of Ferdinand Marcos and the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte won the campaign kickoff mobilisation game, no ifs nor buts.” In terms of production quality, scale of organisation, and overall pizzaz, the performance delivered by Team BBM-Duterte outclassed all the rest. As many in the audience observed, ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga was in her element as host of the event. Her booming voice could have filled the arena even without a mike. To that, Rapplerette Lian Buan sourly points out, “Toni Gonzaga, one of ABS-CBN’s biggest celebrities, introduces Rodante Marcoleta who pushed to deny the franchise renewal of the network costing thousands of Kapamilya workers their jobs.” Buan, still likely butthurt from that “assault on press freedom”, seems to suggest that Gonzaga owes utang na loob (a debt of gratitude) to ABS-CBN. That’s just typical of kiddie “journalists” glossing over the real facts underlying the demise of the top Yellowtard media conglomerate just to push their preferred narrative. Of course, a lame attempt to cut down the the host of the show is futile considering not just the star power that was on exhibit in the event but also the chemistry between the candidates. This was evident in the service vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte did herself in the clear and articulate speech she delivered to introduce herself and the grace she exhibited giving her running mate a rousing introduction. Speaking of stars, third-generation Marcos star Sandro Marcos seemed to be making his dad proud demonstrating an ability to steal the show from the latter as the crowd roared when the big background screen briefly cut to him as he flashed the victory sign. Indeed, it was a wild night — the culmination of steady consistent work over the last eight to twelve months to secure the numbers, form the best relationships and alliances, manage communications and messaging, and, overall, deliver an engaging and sticky brand to Filipino voters. Of course, this was a journey very-well documented by the more objective contributors to the national debate that the Opposition’s chi chi Katipunan-educated “thought leaders” like to pretend do not exist. As such, to really appreciate the remarkable nature of what was achieved by the administration camp would be to note what a respected member of the Opposition camp has to say himself (albeit a tad grudgingly) about even just the latter two to three months of that journey and what, by now, should be an outcome that no longer surprises… ""Marcos’ refusal to slide down and Inday Sara eventually sliding down to number two coated him with a veneer of toughness and finally lent him the air of being a winner; it also gave both him and her (Marcos Jr. and Inday Sara, respectively) something they’d lacked thus far: the sense of being backed by a significant […] durable coalition featuring former president and speaker Arroyo (plus the Romualdezes). It was this drama, and the coalescing of the veteran politicians, that boosted Marcos’ presidential numbers, and made Sara the person to beat for the presidency. It sucked all the air out of the room, politically speaking, stalling the moderate momentum of Leni Robredo who’d kept the remnants of the opposition guessing, and absolutely depriving the other candidates, Moreno, Pacquiao, and Lacson, of what their candidacies needed, too: drama. The keep ’em guessing plus substitution gambit of 2016 succeeded in its 2021 rerun."" The point Inquirer columnist and former Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III was leading to in making the above observation taken from his piece today “Now for the hard part” really had more to do with what he regards as the hard slog the Opposition is in for over the remaining weeks of their campaign. ""This early, his campaign can claim the tantalizing possibility of the first majority presidency since (take your pick) either 1986 or 1969. But there remains hope of the others, currently in the teens or less, percentage-wise, to somehow convince the public to join them and thus start giving the Marcoses a run for their money."" Quezon’s statement of “hope” for the Opposition clearly doubles as a warning. It is a warning because the Opposition, specially the “leading” Yellowtard bloc within it rallying around presidential candidate Leni Robredo show no signs of reforming the negative messaging that characterises their campaign and which contributed to the running to the ground of their campaign. Even more important for the Opposition is that they reconsider the sorts of characters they habitually associate themselves with. In the case of the Yellowtards’ chummy-chummy relations with the Philippines’ Catholic Church the officers of which are held to a vow of obedience to their overlords in Rome, displays like these — of nuns in ancient habits performing ancient rituals — raise questions around how serious Robredo’s camp are about upholding their supposedly progressive character. The standout example, in this instance, is their supposed championing of women’s issues and their supposed alignment with the “causes” of feminism and gay rights. The Roman Catholic Church, we might remind everyone, stands for everything that feminists and the gay community are against. The big challenge in the coming weeks is mainly on the Opposition nuisance candidates. Will they continue competing amongst themselves for the Number Two position? Or will they be able to pull together the mettle, the creative chops, and the groundbreaking originality required to gun for Number One? Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",1
GetRealPhilippines.com," ""...the communists should be throwing their support behind the first ever Philippine president who will be leading a government that will, out of necessity, have to operate outside of America’s sphere of influence."" Members of the Opposition Yellowtard bloc are making it look like presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos’s being banned from setting foot on the soil of the Philippines’ former colonial master is a bad thing. It could be because of their recent falling out with the communists and, now as a result, are opposed to the single biggest pillar of the latter’s “activism” — the fantastical idea that every Filipino president is a tuta (lapdog) of the United States. To remain consistent to their moronic ideology then, the communists should be throwing their support behind the first evah Philippine president who will be leading a government that will, out of necessity, have to operate outside of America’s sphere of influence. A Marcos presidency should therefore be regarded as a gift to Philippine communism. Shortly after President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in 2016, Joma Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), reportedly said in “online interviews” that “[if] deemed necessary by the revolutionary movement, I will return to the Philippines to fight the Duterte puppet regime of US imperialism”. Indeed, communist “activism” has remained consistent to this ululation since time immemorial. The Philippines has long been the United States’ Mini Me. It is a quaint legacy of American aspirations to create a beacon of democracy in the region to assure a world fearful of the communist onslaught that at least one southeast Asian domino will remain standing as the others (as the thinking at the time went) fell. Filipinos of a certain generation — particularly that of Sison’s himself — continue to cling to the obsolete notion that their duty as a people lies in upholding that mission to be instrumental to the containment of any threat to America’s hegemony in the region. This is a notion Sison and his communist henchmen have been battling for decades; to the extent of perpetrating terrorist activities in the countryside through its terror arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). Still, beyond the perverse ideology Sison and his ilk espouse, many traditional Filipino politicians have long demonstrated a cockiness that far exceeds their country’s ability to stand on its own two feet both economically and militarily. Recall in the early 1990s how twelve senators duly elected by the popular vote (and as such presumably representing the Filipino people’s “will”) voted to boot the American Military out of Philippine shores…""Thanks to the 12 bozos who voted against US military bases in the Philippines in 1991 — Senate President Jovito Salonga, Sens. Wigberto Tanada, Teofisto Guingona, Rene Saguisag, Victor Ziga, Sotero Laurel, Ernesto Maceda, Agapito Aquino, Juan Ponce Enrile, Joseph Estrada, Orlando Mercado, and Aquilino Pimentel — Filipinos have, right in their faces today, a sad lesson twenty years in the making in what it is like to languish outside the American sphere of what is globally relevant."" Well herein now, by all accounts, is presented a candidate in Marcos Jr. who, whether he himself likes it or not, promises to slam the door on any further “imperialism” the United States presumes to effect on its former “brown brothers” in the Far East. What then of the old Cold War rheroric of the CPP-NPA? The other day, Inquirer columnist Ma. Ceres P. Doyo issued a veiled threat writing that “[a] Marcos win will fuel the armed insurgency. 1980s redux, a déjà vu.” That will be an interesting circus to behold indeed specially the part where these commies engineer further convolution into their propaganda in their continued lame attempts to navigate the landscape of inconsistencies they’ve laid before their “cause”.",1

By implying that those who challenge their account of the “Martial Law Years” and slapped the label “revisionist” across their faces, they have elevated their Martial Law narrative of superstitious fear and loathing into no less than a national dogma. So now, right up there with Roman Catholicism is the second state religion: Martial Law Crybabyism. The two national dogmas now stand as non-debatable edifices of traditional Filipino thinking. The tenets of these two vast frameworks of thought are what Filipinos are told to think by the powers that be. In essence, those who use these two state religions to win arguments are not contributing to creating a true Filipino thinking class. They are, instead, further dumbing down the discourse and making Filipinos even more susceptible to the very “fake news” the Yellowtards profess to hate. Rather than encourage Filipinos to critically challenge ideas and not engage in groupthink, the Yellowtards prefer that their flock toe the line and sing from a single hymn book.

That's beside the point. Credible institutions all over the world are not Filipinos.

Pinoy Trending News,"The appointment of former PNP Chief Camilo Cascolan has been met with raised eyebrows and mocking Laughter from the anti-Marcos groups including the Dilawans/Pinklawans on Twitter. A certain Jezreelle De Guzman Domingo - Hortaleza, apparently a Marcos supporter took to Facebook to defend Cascolan's appointment as one of the Usec's at DOH. Hortaleza appealed to people to hear her first before before mocking the appointment of former PNP Chief Coscalan's as DOH Usec. Hortaleza enumerated 7 reasons why Cascolan's appointment as DOH Usec is nothing to scoff at. Hortaleza ended the FB post by telling anti-Marcos critics to act like they are better than the President, they should become president first. BTW, the author is a medical doctor and affiliated with KonsultaMD, a telehealth membership service that allows you to have 24/7 unlimited access to licensed doctors, no appointment needed. You can consult a doctor via voice or video call anytime and as often as you want. You may now read Jezreelle De Guzman Domingo - Hortaleza's FB post below.  Bago niyo pa pagtawanan si Former PNP Chief Cascolan bilang Usec ng DOH... 1. Usec lang po siya at hindi Secretary... alamin niyo muna kung saan siya Usec bago kayo magmagaling. 2. Kahit pa secretary, wala pong requirement sa batas na dapat Doctor ang maging secretary or high official ng DOH 3. Ang DOH po ay isang departamento at hindi isang Ospital, ang kailangan higit sa anu pa man ay Administration and Management... 4. Kahit sa Ospital nga may mga opisyal n hindi rin naman doctor... may abogado, may Engr. depende kung saan sila nakaassign... 5. Si Gen. Cascolan ay may Masters Degree in Public Administration... 6. Kung gusto natin ng reporma sa DOH... hayaan natin ayusin ang problemadong administrasyon ng departamento, baka kailangan natin ng administrative expertise ng hndi naman isang doctor... 7. Sorry to burst your bubble, Hindi po lahat ng posisyon sa DOH, puro doctor ang kelangan....basa muna bago reklamo...@ Wag magmarunong... otherwise, ikaw muna maging Pangulo... Reaction? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"For the nth time, a Marcos loyalist from Bicol found the need to explain to netizens, particularly the Dilawans/Pinklawans why a Bicolano like him is a PBBM supporter/defender and not a Robredo supporter. If you've been following Engr. Benjie Contreras Jr. for quite some time because he is a Marcos loyalist like you, (he is the older brother of La Salle Professor Antonio Contreras) I assume you already know why he is a Marcos loyalist. According to Engr. Contreras, their history with the Marcoses started in 1965 when former PFEM ran for President and his father was a lawyer and a member of the Nacionalista Party. Engr. Contreras's father was so impressed with PFEM's intelligence. A bit of trivia, Engr. Contreras' mother was pregnant of their youngest at that time so his father made a promised that he will name the baby after Imelda if it was a girl and after PFEM, if it was a boy. Their youngest came out a boy, so the rest is history. In the 2022 presidential election, Engr. Contreras organized the Oragon Bicol BBM-Sara campaign headquarter in Naga City together with an unnamed individual who also served as the HQ's financier. Because of this, they experienced harassments from Leni supporters but they did not mind it. You may now read Engr. Contreras' original FB post below. Sa mga nagtatanong kung bakit ang katulad kong Bicolano na mismong kababayan ni Leni Robredo sa Naga City, Camarines Sur ay isang Marcos loyalist na ngayon ay mahigpit na tagapagtanggol ni Pres. Bongbong Marcos Jr. heto po ang aking kuwento. Namana ko ang pagiging Marcos loyalist ko sa aking mga magulang. Noong 1965 ng unang tumakbo ng pagkapangulo si Pres FEM, siya ang kandidato ng father ko na isang lawyer at NP member. Hangang- hanga ang father ko sa talino ni PFEM. Noong panahon yon buntis ang Nanay ko sa bunso namin and PFEM won over incumbent Pres Diosdado Macapagal. My father promised to name our youngest sibling Imelda if she would be a baby girl and Ferdinand if he would be a baby boy. Our youngest came out a boy so my parents named him Ferdinand. So from 1965 until present day, the Contreras have been Marcos loyalists including Engr. Contreras' wife who was pro-Aquino but he managed to convert her into a loyalist. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The San Juanico Lighting, which was actually the initiative of the previous administration, has been criticized by some people, including the netizen below. The netizen questioned the P81M spent on lighting the San Juanico Bridge while the country are facing three major problems like inflation, insurmountable debt and the pandemic. She asked if it was necessary when Filipinos families have a hard time putting food on the table. She said the government must focused on building good quality infrastructures like bridges to protect the lives of ordinary people. She shared the photo of the collapsed bridge in Pangasinan for emphasis on the point she's trying to make. Meanwhile, not all netizens disagree with the much-needed facelift of San Juanico. Government prosecutor and a self-confessed anti-Dilawan influencer named Darwin Canete (Canete is pronounced with enye) took up cudgels on behalf of the government. Canete said that the facelift of San Juanico Bridge is very much-deserved under the administration of PMarcos Jr.. The bridge he argued basically saved the devastated areas ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan because it was the singular lifeline to deliver life-saving provisions when ports and airports where unusable. On Atty. Darwin accusing PNoy admin of abandoning the typhoon Haiyan victims, Rappler and Vera Files will disagree with Atty. Darwin's allegation that PNoy abandoned the Typhoon Yolanda victims.

De Leon quipped that the 31M aren't scared of somebody who just suffered the greatest presidential electoral defeat in Philippine politics, an upset that stunned the world of wokes and liberal progressives. De Leon added that the wokes and liberal progressives were clueless that the Marcos brand was unbeatable during that time.

In that regard, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza cannot help but take a swipe at former colleagues in the news and broadcasting industry. In a Facebook post, Sonza said that the journalism profession isn't for cowards, pretentious and full of themselves. Sonza added that if you are not ready for any eventuality like getting vilified and what not, scratch off journalism profession as an option of your career choice. Sonza said his secrets how he retired unharmed from the journalism profession are prayers, the truth, staying humble but at the same time security conscious and knowing how to defend himself.

The broadcaster and vlogger offered the nice gesture to the basher, a rabid Kakampink, knowing his critic started the boycott call of his restaurants. But before that, Ka Tunying who took offense of the critic's generalization that all 31 million voters of PBBM have no purchasing power or penniless dismissed that notion as untrue. He also denied rumor Ka Tunying's restaurants are hurt by their boycott call, claiming the sales of his restaurants are still okay. BTW, the Kakampink supporter was triggered by Ka Tunying who made the remark that the Kakampinks aren't learning their lesson that cancelling businesses owned by what they call Marcos enablers does not work. For example, #BoycottShopee, #EngBee Tin and what. Out of anger, the Kakampink critic urged fellow Kakampinks to boycott Ka Tunying's restaurants to teach him a lesson that will hurt his pocket.

Nick Nangit, a known pro-Duterte influencer to the revelation of Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Hidilyn Diaz that she's facing another funding issues for her training. ICYMI, the Philippines 1st and lone gold medalist in the Tokyo Olympics is training for the 2024 Paris Olympics and once again, she ran to her mainstream media friends and told them about her funding issues. While some pinoys are sympathetic to her cause, some Pinoy netizens, especially the so-called pro-Duterte crowd, including Atty. Nick Nangit are sending strong message to Hidilyn to not expect financial help, even sympathy from them. In a Facebook post, Atty. Nick asked Ms. Hidilyn Diaz how come she is having funding issues in light of the many incentives she received that most ordinary Pinoys can only dreamed of after delivering the Philippines 1st Olympic gold medal? Where did all your money go? What are your expenses? Are the financial support the government give you for your training not enough? Atty. Nick asked. Why not talk to the PSC first (instead of taking your case to socmed)? Or better yet, ask financial help from your Ninang (Leni)? Atty. Nick's FB followers took the cue from him and did not respond positively to Hidilyn Diaz's appeal for financial help. Instead, Pinoy netizens made hurtful remarks towards the Tokyo gold medalist in weightlifting. ""Its not enough. She wants more!!!! Dilawan move..."" wrote one person. ""Nung nanalo ka parang hindi ka man lang nagpasalamat sa pamahalaan. Pag sure diha dzae ka ng NINANG mo"" another person took this as an opportunity to reproach Diaz for being an ingrate. anak ""Naging mukhang pera na cya. Magpa sponsor ka sa angat buhay ni lenifink.

But after a day of waiting, dashed hopes and teeth gnashing dominated the mood in the camp of SOJ Boying Remulla's critics after PBBM issued a statement saying he has found no valid reason to let go of SOJ Remulla for the simple reason that his mature son did something against the law, thus the critics of SOJ Remulla were left with dashed hopes and perhaps reduced to teeth gnashing. But before PBBM made the statement, Ms. Krizette Laureta Chu of Manila Bulletin seemed to know that the critics of SOJ Remulla were in for a huge letdown.

Sandro Marcos' now famous ""piso is not weak"" statement, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes took up the cudgels on Sandro's behalf. Reyes offered 2 reasons why the PH peso is weak such as the PH is a net importer and the US Federal Reserve's aggressive actions versus inflation. Reyes lamented that some people would rather mock Sandro Marcos and the administration instead of trying to understand the situation and what they can do to help the country. Reyes said these are the same ""unselfless"" people, if they have the means, would rather buy dollars and invest in the US instead of investing their money in the country to help the local economy. In other words, bunches of hypocrites. Reyes said she is fine if people criticize Sandro Marcos for the staged photo ops in Singapore but not on his recent statement: re peso versus the dollar. She clarified she is not defending Sandro but to expose the ignorance, hypocrisy, and 'unselflessness' of some people. You may now read MJ Reyes' original FB post below. The PHpeso is weak: 1) Because we import more and export less 2) Because of US Federal Reserve's aggressive actions against inflation which made US $ stronger - consequently devaluing peso and other currencies. 3) Because some people would rather laugh at Sandro and bash him and this admin than try to better understand the situation and do what they can to help our country. The same ""unselfless"" people who, if they have the means, would rather buy more dollars and invest in US and spend their money abroad than help strengthen our peso or help boost our economy. Tsk! P.S. People can fairly criticize Sandro for his 'staged' photo ops sa SG and other matters, but not on his recent statement re: peso & dollar. I'm not here to defend him (as he does not need one naman). This is just to expose the ignorance, hypocrisy, and 'unselflessness' of some people. ",1

ICYMI, SP Zubiri claimed that the Chinese Ambassador to Manila told him that the Philippines has been included in China's Tourism blacklist for hosting Chinese POGO establishments. However, SP Zubiri's insider's info did not age well as the Chinese Embassy in Manila quickly issued a statement denying the claim of the senate president. On that note, radio host and vlogger Mark Lopez can't help but give SP Zubiri a tongue-lashing in a Facebook post for peddling fake news.

It has caused undue stress and panic not to mention strained relations with China because of one careless mistake este lost in translation as the senator claimed and worse, he did not think twice to spread his wrong translation to mainstream media and beyond.

Si First lady Liza pa ba naman ang magpapahamak at gagawa ng dahilan upang hindi maging matagumpay ang ating mahal na Pangulo BBM? Walang lohika ito.

Abines began by pointing out that hoisting an inmate at the center of national attention is doing any justice for the Filipino people. Unbeknownst to us, the Camp Crame incident might be a sequence of schemes after the murder of a radio broadcaster (media block timer) failed to punch a hole in PBBM admin ship. He warned more might be coming. Constructive criticism Abines warned that unless PBBM change his strategy of playing nice and being compromising President, his entire term of 6 years will be reduced to reacting and putting out fires his enemies will start in an attempt to bring him down. Abines recalled that when PRRD assumed office, his enemies gave him difficult test right away. Remember the Bohol siege and Marawi? PRRD did not blink and made sure all terrorists were neutralized and that sent a strong signal to his enemies to behave. Abines remarked that PBBM will also be tested by enemies just like what they did to PRRD. That is why Abines is advising PBBM to start calling the shots because he has the impression, sorry to this, PBBM isn't. Otherwise, his enemies will run him over. Lastly, Abines implored PBBM to rid the country of leeches and parasites that suck the blood of the country. You may now read Jun Abines original FB post below.

For all we know, the whole incident was a sequence of scheme after the murder of media block timer did not punch a hole in the PBBM Admin ship. More might be coming. If PBBM does not change his strategy of being the good, likeable and compromising President, his whole term of six years will be spent on reacting and fire fighting. He will unknowingly dance to the beat orchestrated by his enemies. When Duterte became the President, his enemies tested him by having terrorists sieged Bohol and Marawi. Duterte did not blink. He made sure all terrorists were killed and no siege attempt was made after that. Same for PBBM. He will be tested by his enemies. He either call the shots or he will be made to sweep every mess caused by his enemies. Just to prevent him from doing the most important task of the President: Serve the people by getting rid of all the leeches and parasites that made this country poor for the longest time. God help Philippines! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"PBBM's tweet he will speak to former Senator Leila De Lima following the hostage-taking incident at Camp Crame to check on her condition and to ask her if she wishes to be transferred to another facility seems very unpopular among Duterte supporters who grudgingly supported him for President in the 2022 polls because they can't stand Leni as President. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu, a known Duterte defender/self-confessed anti-Marcos/Leni supporter in 2016 VP polls/rabid anti-Leni since she began attacking ex-PRRD, has wrote an open letter to PBBM in reaction to the president's tweet (see below for context). In the said open letter, Ms. Chu began by reminding PBBM about the fine line between unity and pleasing people. Chu remarked that PBBM telling his DOJ Secretary to talk to De Lima and convey his message is acceptable to Duterte supporters in the name of unity but him saying he will speak to De Lima to check on her and what not borders on pleasing people. Chu said that not everyone gets or will get the same treatment from PBBM because he does not have the time. Chu politely asked PBBM not to help critics perpetuate the idea that he only deals with VIP. Chu ended the open letter by imploring PBBM to send his Secretary to speak or call De ima just like the way he sent his Secretary to deal with other issues to avoid sending mixed signals to the public. Ms. Chu's followers, more than 10,000 of them, hit the like or heart button, signifying their support of her antagonistic stance to PBBM's intention to personally visit De Lima after the Camp Crame incident. Some netizens can't help but compare PBBM to President Duterte while others say they are starting to believe what ex-PRRD said that PBBM is a weak leader. Weak leader talaga walang ka bayag bayag.. nakakalungkot.. l-oust na natin yan para si VP Sara na pumalit sa weak leader na yan. Known drug coddler, may special treatment pa? Nkakamiss si PRRD.. kaya siguro nag 90% ulit ang rating sa latest survey, marami rami na nakarealize na mas maganda ang pamumuno ng palamurang mama. Buti na lang talaga nag abstain ako sa voting sa President last election. Sara lang talaga may bilang eh.. This one is starting regret about voting PBBM. Although I am truly happy that Leni isn't our president, ngayon ako nagsisisi kung bakit against ako na tumakbo for president si Inday dati coz I banked more on BBM. Kaya pala sya pinupush ni PRRD noon at pinatakbo rin si SBG. I now understand the wisdom of PRRD.I don't see BBM as totally weak though. His strength is maybe lurking somewhere. Everyone has a weakness. Trying to prove the accusations about him and his family wrong is BBM's that his kindness becomes too good to be true. I am sure he has fangs somewhere. I hope he makes use of them at the right time and for the right people. This sentiment is echoed by another. Nabudol pala ako. Nagkamali yata ako ng binoto. Tama si Ex-PRD. He is a weak leader. Style niya bulok. Wala pinagkakaiba kay PNOY, RAMOS, GMA. CORY... Just want to look pleasing. Kung baga, papogi sa International Community. Some netizens want to give PBBM the benefit of the doubt. PBBM has a lot of information that are not available even to the VP. Trust PBBM. he knows what he is doing. He could even be sending a message to those secretly hatching something at the dark!#TheGameOnlyMastersPlay I am not a Loyalist and I don't normally defend BBM. But I think I get what he's doing. There's an obvious plot against BBM by blaming the administration for all the 'attacks' on the opposition. By personally checking up on De Lima, I think that will counter the accusation thrown towards him on the recent 'attacks' to the opposition. I think that is how BBM personally countering the stage play of the enemy. Well he's the PRESIDENT of the Republic of the Philippines, he can do what ever he wants in accordance with the law, hndi nman cguro na porket galit tyo o ang tao kay Delima eh gnun din ang galit ng President sa knya...ika nga bawat President ay May iba ibang paraan how to handle things.. There's a line for how you treat people because you hate her. She's still human and has pending cases thus she's still innocent. Any decent people like BBM will protect her even if she's an opposition. P.s I hate her too Dear PBBM, There's a fine line between unity and people pleasing. You can have your DOJ Secretary talk to De Lima but for those of us who hate her, you saying ""I will speak to her and check her condition and ask her if she wants to be transferred,"" seems like its bordering on people pleasing. Not everyone gets or will get this same treatment from you. You won't have the time. Please don't help your critics perpetuate the idea that you only deal with VIPs. In the way you sent your Secretary to deal with issues of the others, we hope we don't get mixed signals from you and you also just send someone else to call or speak with De Lima. Salamat. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Following the Camp Crame incident today wherein 3 fellow detainees allegedly took hostage of former Senator Leila de Lima after a botched prison break, netizens on Twitter and Facebook have mixed reactions. As expected, the Dilawan supporters and pro-de Lima crowd hijacked PBBM's thread on Twitter and took this as an opportunity to demand the release of the former senator from detention and let her walk away as a free woman. wuy thanks. if i were you i would release her instead of transferring her to another detainment bago ka pa pag hinalaan na ikaw ang may gusto magpapatay sa kanya. unahan mo na mga plastic friends mo Release her now, Sir! She does not deserve to be in jail in the first place.  Meanwhile, the anti-de Lima crowd have a different idea. Since she’s not a senator anymore, suggesting she be in a city jail while on trial.  Hindi nan ga sya senador kaya dapat nasa bilibid nay an at di sa Crame. On Facebook, influencer and staunch Duterte supporter Krizette Laureta Chu opened a thread to propose a solution how to keep former senator Leila de Lima safe while she is on trial. I hope they put Delima in an isolation cell for the rest of her stay so she doesn't become a target for hostage taking since she's a high profile inmate.Please DOJ protect De Lima and put her in a bartolina.

Pinoy Trending News,"Radio host and vlogger Mark Lopez slammed former Vice Presidential candidate Kiko Pangilinan on Facebook after his photos during a public market tour while on a visit to Thailand went viral, of course with the help of his friends in mainstream media like the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Kiko Pangilinan's photos highlighted the stark difference of the prices of agricultural products like garlic and onion between Thailand versus the Philippines. Lopez described Pangilinan's photos as nothing but a publicity stunt to project himself as the champion of Philippine agriculture who can provide the answer to cheap agriculture products but in reality, he did nothing when he was appointed by PNoy as Food Security Adviser. Lopez told Kiko Pangilinan to stop pulling such publicity stunts, posing himself as some kind of Philippine Agriculture's knight in white shining armor because that won't work anymore to Filipinos who are now wiser than ever. Mark Lopez's FB followers jumped in and joined him in slamming Kiko Pangilinan. Nung nasa posisyon at may magagawa tahimik! Ngayung Wala sa posisyon Panay Ang kuda! wrote one person. Another person wrote that Kiko Pangilinan did not pass a bill to stop smuggling of onions etc but now he has the gall to point out cheap onion and garlic. Wala nga siya nagawang batas laban sa mga smugglers ng sibuyas at bawang nung nakaupo siya, ngayon, turo-turo sya ng murang bawang at sibuyas. This netizen joked that since he discovered that prices in Thailand is cheaper, then Kiko should do his shopping for ingredients there. eh di sa Thailand at Vietnam ka mamalengke ng pang sahog mo pag mag luluto ka You may now read Mark Lopez's original FB post below.

Eagle Broadcasting news anchor CJ Hirro and influencer is one of those who took to social media to belittle Renato Reyes' death threat story in a Facebook post. Hirro asked if Renato Reyes really have to make everything about him that even the death of a respected journalist is an opportunity to portray himself as some kind of a hero? Hirro said there was nothing special or startling about Reyes' statement regarding the Singapore trip of PBBM that warranted him to be shut down for good. Hirro also asked if Reyes still thinks that his rehashed battlecries he used in every administration still make an impact? Hirro remarked that even his colleagues have tired of them and have turned their backs to the organization Reyes is part of and everything it claims they stand for.

Pinoy Trending News,"Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile, the ever outspoken legal luminary, does not disappoint his FB followers because despite his busy schedule, he still finds time to impart his wisdom to the reading public, be it on legal matters, politics or even personal opinion on burning issues of the day. Speaking of personal opinion, JPE as his colleagues and even the media call him, talked about people who tends to bite more than they can chew, sort of in his latest FB post. JPE remarked that some people tends to overestimate themselves. He said that these people should reflect on the proverb, which was later made part of a song that goes like this, ""Fool rush in when angels fear to tread or walk."" To give a hint to what he was alluding, JPE mentioned about Harvard and lecturing on esoteric subjects Like ECONOMICS, especially at this time in history is no laughing matter, not even for renowned names in ECONOMICS such as Adam Smith and Keynes. I had to ask Google what is the meaning of the word esoteric and this is what Mr. Google has to say- ""ESOTERIC"" means intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest. In fairness to JPE, he did not name names but reading at the comments on his thread, netizens dropped their guesses who JPE was talking about. Here are some of the comments of netizens. One only needs to be unselfless to not overestimate their limitations. Ask mama leni what unselfless means, sa kanya galing yun, can't wait for video lectures in harvard.

On Twitter, Tanada condemned the killing of Percy Lapid while at the same time, attempted to galvanize public anger against PBBM admin because the k*ll*ng occured on his 100th day in service, actually in office, made the rounds online. As predicted, Vince Tanada's jab at PBBM did not go unnoticed and elicited an equal, even more vicious response from a Duterte supporter who also supports the Marcos administration. In a Facebook post, Lopez scrutinized Tanada's statement and lo and behold, Lopez found a hole in Tanada's statement which prompted him to alert his followers.

Pinoy Trending News,"The successive resignations of the Press Secretary and the Ombudsman in just a day has triggered celebrations and ululations figuratively speaking on Twitter and Facebook among the critics of the PBBM administration, particularly the Kakampinks and rabid anti-Marcos to annoy the Marcos supporters. Of course, the Marcos supporters did not like the taunting from the supporters of the Kakampinks and the rabid Marcos critics, including Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu who is a long known anti-Marcos. But obviously, when she has to choose between Leni and PBBM, Chu's choice is apparently PBBM hands down. In a Facebook post, Chu responded to the taunting of the supporters of Leni, saying even PBBM changes his Cabinet men, it is still fine with her than when Leni is President. Chu remarked that if Leni was President, when she changed her ES (Executive Secretary) the choices would be limited to Drilon, Gordon, Lacierda and Bam Aquino. Chu is horrified at the thought of Leni as President and the ES would be the above-mentioned names. Chu cheered PBBM while urging him to change ES every day until he feels the need for it in jest. Chu's FB followers responded to her FB post on a positive note, generating 11,000+ reactions in just 10 hours and counting. 8,000+ of the reactors hit FB's laugh emoji, proof that Chu's followers were amused of her response to the taunting of Kakampinks.

Pinoy Trending News,"PBBM's weekend visit to Singapore to watch the F1 Grand Prix, the highly anticipated return of the most prestigious racing event in the world after 2 year hiatus is turning out to be the focal point of attack of his critics and the administration. The wokes, mostly Leni Robredo supporter and Marcos haters, had a field day on Twitter criticizing the weekend trip of PBBM. The wokes raised mixed issues against the Singapore weekend trip of PBBM to watch F1 Grand Prix. One certain Gerry Cacanindin, a rabid Leni Robredo supporter and influencer, focused in painting the presidential weekend trip as a extravagant waste of taxpayers' money by sharing a rundown of the cost of the flight from Manila-Singapore. To agitate the public and even the Marcos supporters, Cacanindin claimed that PBBM used the presidential jet. Meanwhile, the #1 Dilawan blogger and influencer Jover Laurio, who is no longer tweeting as Pinoy Ako Blog, but as Jover herself, is more subtle in attacking PBBM by making sarcastic comments. Meanwhile, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu, a staunch Duterte supporter and self-confessed anti- Marcos influencer ran to PBBM's defense on Facebook. Chu said the criticism on PBBM for flying to Singapore to watch the F1 Grand Prix is unreasonable because its only a question of what's offensive to the morals and sense of propriety of the critics. However, if PBBM used government resources for a personal trip, then that altogether a different story and that is something even pro-BBM supporters should talk in the open. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post below. The question isn't if PBBM watched the F1 races. The question is, did he spend government resources doing so? If no, it's only a question of what's offensive to your morals and sense of propriety. You don't think he should have gone to something so ostentatious, but he is not in violation of anything, but offending you. If yes, he used government resources for a personal trip (it's not a state visit), then it's something that even pro government people should discuss openly. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The Kakampinks are launching a spirited campaign online, particularly on Twitter, urging fellow Kakampinks and anti-Marcos peeps to cancel #ShopeePH for hiring Toni Gonzaga as their brand ambassador. In my opinion, these toxic Kakampinks need a tap in their shoulders to tell them, ""Hey, whatever you guys are doing isn't just going to harm ShopeePH but also your fellow Kakampinks in the process."" Speaking of which, Tio Moreno, pro-Duterte influencer and now defending the Marcos admin just took to Facebook and gave the Kakampinks a very timely reminder that razing ShopeePH to the ground will not only hurt the so-called Marcos enablers but also fellow Kakampink business owners who are doing business with ShopeePH. Moreno debunked the Kakampinks' insinuation ShopeePH is downsizing in order to pay for the huge talent of Toni Gonzaga is simply not true. Because the downsizing isn't exclusive in ShopeePH but a global phenomenon. Moreno ended the FB post without disappointing his FB followers. How? By taking a jab at the Kakampinks' political leader, saying their behavior tells a lot about the kind of influence their political bet have on them. Ouch! You may now read Tio Moreno's original FB post below. Cancelling SHOPEE because they got Toni Gonzaga as endorser means cancelling local business owners and workers regardless of political leaning. Remember, you stan Nina Ellaine Dizon Cabrera (CEO of Colourette) because she's a KAKAMPINK--but did you know that Shopee is one of her business outlets and it is where she and her employees earn their income? Are you aware that Shopee has been cutting headcounts, not only in the Philippines, but globally? Cancelling them in our country will make things worse. YOU--being consumed by your hatred because of politics speaks volumes of the influence your political bet has shown you. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Twitter is abuzz with Kakampinks and anti-Marcos wokes talking about ShopeePH choosing Toni G. over its employees that that downsizing was inevitable because of her huge talent fee. A ShopeePH employee who is affected by the downsizing took to Facebook to debunk this fake news. According to a certain Aigy Rose Alba, (senior Shopee analyst) they saw it coming long before it reached the Philippine shores after the closure of its overseas headquarters due to the global recession. But they were not expecting it to happen this fast and they weren't ready. Ask her why? Because prior to the downsizing notice, ShopeePH never burdened them with the company's losses. The perks they enjoy like free ice cream in the office, salaries and what not continue coming and on time. Ms. Alba bragged that until the very end, ShopeePH was very generous by securing them a separation package that is more than what they expected. So big that the separation package can even tide them over, celebrate the upcoming holidays, even start a new business or even buy a new iphone. On people saying that ShopeePH chose Toni G. over their employees, Ms. Alba told them to stop sowing intrigues because the real reason is just purely business, no more no less. Like any other companies, Shopee have a business plan and timeline, including budgeting for that purpose. Marketing and OPEX (Operating expenses) are two different things. She clarified she's not from the Marketing side and anyone can google if they wish to know more. On people saying that Toni G is an enable, Ms. Alba dismissed this allegation as hogwash since ShopeePH has demonstrated in the past that they don't make decisions based on politics because they had Ambassadors in the past who came from the Opposite political camp. Ms. Alba punctuated the highly emotional FB post by appealing to the unnamed people to stop using their heartbreaks for their political advantage. You may now read Ms. Aigy Rose Alba's original FB post below. You probably saw me posting different goodies with #SalamatShopee. But this one is different. Yes, my role was impacted with Shopee's down size of workforce here in PH. But contrary to the chismis ni marites. We did not loose our job because of the endorser's TF. Somehow, we saw it coming. With the closure of overseas headquarters due to global recession, we knew we will be affected one day. We weren't expecting though that it would happen that fast and we weren't ready. Why? Kasi Shopee never burdened us with their losses. We were just enjoying our free ice cream in the office, perks, goodies, salary etc name it, we get it. On time, on the dot, without fail. Even until the very end, Shopee secured a separation package that is more than what we expected - to make sure that us employees and our families can start anew and still celebrate the upcoming holidays. Probably start a business or buy a new iphone? Sana all! Sa mga nagsasabing Shopee choose the endorser vs us, their employees. FYI, Shopee is a business. May business plan and timeline yan. Budgeting didn't happen overnight. It was already forecasted beforehand. Marketing and OPEX costing are way different. Wala ako sa marketing, pero pwede nyo i-google yan. Also, sa enabler claims nyo, pls don't forget that we also have ambassadors from the different political spectrum. Wag double standard. Kaya please! Don't use our heartbreaks for your political advantage. Stop using us with your cancel culture. You have the right to stand for your political views. Pero wag kami! Iba na lang. Nag momove-on pa lang kami mahirap mawalan ng mabuti at maalagang employer. Basta kami, we wish them to soar back higher. And hopefully, have us back sooner.

Pinoy Trending News,"Angat Buhay Isabela shared Lian Buan of Rappler-inspired quote card to send a message to the Marcos government that when the going gets tough, it's the journalist from mainstream media who will show up to deliver the news to the public, especially during disasters, not the vloggers and influencers which they are so enamored to provide the so-called unbiased content. Angat Buhay Isabela also shared a photo collage of mainstream media reporters from ABS-CBN and GMA News who answered the call of duty during typhoon to drive home its point. The message of Lian Buan and Angat Buhay wants to deliver to the Marcos admin is that they were wrong to chose the vloggers and influencers over journalists is wrong. However, this line of argument from Lian Bian did not sound pleasing to the ears of Ms. Sass Rogando Sasot, a vlogger and influencer herself and wasted no time in bursting their bubble. According to Sasot, the journalists went there because their employers told them so, accompanied by crew and riding a company vehicle. They did not go there as volunteers like Angat Buhay and Lian Buan wants us to believe. Pinapunta po sila dyan ng network na pinagtatrabahuhan nila at sila po ay may crew at sasakyan provided by the network. Akala mo naman nag ""volunteer"" sila dyan. Ms. Sasot's followers also share her sentiment as shown in the comments below. True Ms. Sass, even if they don't want to go there but it's their job they are employed so they have no choice. one person said. That is their job. The Network - Their Employer sends them there, chimed in another person.

Actually, we can now get real information from locals who has access to social media. They can post real time events without twisting the facts like these paid journalists. This comment from a netizen deserves space for articulating the sentiment of the majority of Ms. Sasot's followers. It is their duty and they are paid for it, period! They have all the resources and protection to go to their assigned area, why would they compare themselves to the vloggers. ",1

Take advantage the cheaper price like what India and China did, one netizen said. Another netizen seemed upset with the news though. That is just a stupid move! I hope its not true. Another netizen doubted the news report is true. Negotiating with Russia will have repercussion. Pressure will come from us and Europe and other allies. Highly unlikely. Meanwhile, this netizen very much welcomed the news report. Time to change direction. We should stop patronizing Middle Eastern countries oil which keep rising in price. Another wrote that little by little, he has been proven that he did not make the wrong choice when he voted PBBM in the last election despite earning the ire of some friends and classmates. until until kunang napapatunayan sa sarili ko na Hindi talaga Ako nagkamali Ng binoto. kahit nagalit pa saakin mga kaibigan at kaklase ko.ang nasa isip kulang noon.para sa Future Ng mga anak ko. You may now read Jay Sonza's original FB post below. After meeting with American leaders and investors in New York, our government is in talks with Russian oil officials. Balak ng Pilipinas na umangkat ng langis mula sa Russia. Mr. Marcos wants to secure a steady supply for our country, and at a much reasonable price. Now who says, the son of the former dictator, a school drop out, and a weakling leader is not good to become the president of the Republic? The more than 31 million Filipinos think otherwise. It seems to me they are right! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Filipinos, especially the 31 million Pinoys who voted PBBM in the last election are gnashing their teeth in social media after Greta Thunberg, the controversial international climate activist, was quoted saying there can be no climate justice under Marcos. Link here to read news article re Greta Thunberg statement on Marcos and climate justice. As predicted, the anti-Marcos netizens welcomed Thunberg's jab at PBBM and the Marcoses with, I imagined, celebratory dances. Meanwhile, foreigner from the United Kingdom went out of his way to write an open letter addressed to Greta Thunberg expressing his disappointment at his fellow European. Malcolm Conlan, a Brits married to a Filipina and a pro-Duterte and now Marcos supporter clarified in the open letter he has no issue whatsoever Thunberg trying to support the Philippines and her people regarding the issues of climate change, as he is very sure that this is within her expertise. But as for Greta Thunberg having a lot to say about the PBBM and his government's climate policy and the issue on Martial Law, Conlan was apparently disappointed at the Swede international climate activist for speaking out without an iota of idea of what she was talking, like Martial law and the Marcoses. Conlan ended the open letter by leaving Thunberg with some words of wisdom - continue to campaign for your own advocacy and do not speak about anything that you know absolutely nothing about. Ouch! You may now read Malcolm Conlan's open letter below. AN OPEN LETTER TO GRETA FROM A CONCERNED NETIZEN FAO: Greta Thunberg 'Climate Activist' Dear Ma'am Greta Thunberg, I hope you don't mind me writing to you like this ma'am, but from what I have read on various news sites, you have been quoted as saying the following: 'There can be no climate Justice under Marcos. We stand with solidarity with the Martial Law victims seeking justice and the human rights defenders pursuing democratic rights of people and climate justice! With the greatest respect, how old are you? These events which you have completely misunderstood happened long before you were even born!!! You say there could be no climate justice under Marcos? Maybe you were asleep or blinded by ignorance during the UNGA where President Bongbong Marcos specifically addressed the issue of climate change in his recent speech? The President actually shares your concerns over the effects of climate change to the Philippines and her people. I didn't hear him mention you and call out the name 'Thunberg' at all anywhere in the speech. What gives you the right to not even address him by his proper title, the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Please have some respect for the Office of the President ma'am. Also do you have any Filipino relatives or does anything that happens in the Philippines concern or affect you in anyway? I, on the other hand do have Filipino relatives both here in the UK and the Philippines and of course I am therefore concerned, like you over the effects of climate change. However the difference between you and me is that I am always polite and respectful to all I address and meet, unlike the manner in which you have chosen to speak about President BBM and his family. I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with you trying to support the Philippines and her people regarding the issues of climate change, as I am very sure that this is within your expertise. However, I am not sure that you have any understanding whatsoever regarding the Marcos family or the Martial law era or reasons behind the declaration of Martial law? So with only the greatest respect, I would ask that you continue to campaign for your own advocacy and do not speak about anything that you know absolutely nothing about. Thanks so much and kind regards, Malcolm Conlan Social media advocate and supporter of the Philippines and her people. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A Marcos admin-leaning influencer has called out a Kakampink-leaning FB page for a deceptive post by sharing two photos - the view on the UN Assembly participants during the speeches of two leaders, one view purportedly that of Guatemalan President Dr. Alejandro Giammetai and the other view belongs to President Marcos. Mark Lopez, a pro-Duterte but now leaning towards the Marcos government, was apparently incensed because as pointed out by Manila Bulletin's preeminent Cyber Security Analyst Art Samaniego Jr, the man on the wide screen and on camera wasn't the Guatemalan President but UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierres. Lopez quipped that because of the burning desire of PBBM's critics to embarrass him, they need to resort to deception using imagery. Lopez turned his attention to the Kakampinks who are sharing the photos and asked how do they feel after it turned out that the photos they share are fake. He can't help but ask if they are part of the conspiracy? Otherwise, they are too stupid to fall for such chicanery. You may now read Mark Lopez's original FB post below.

Pinoy Trending News,"The irony or symbolism of PBBM, son of the most maligned Philippine president in history, taking the spotlight at the United Nations to talk about human rights, peace and security etc.. during the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law did not escape the keen eyes of Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu. In a Facebook post, Ms. Chu cannot help but remarked that indeed fate has a wicked sense of humor. Why? While PBBM and the Marcos name is relevant again and have all the spotlight and back in power, the so-called ""freedom fighters"" who have been in the spotlight after the Marcoses left are struggling for relevance. Ms. Chu ended the brief FB post by asking the Universe for explanation of the changing tide of political fortunes. Here are some the comments from netizens in reaction to Ms. Chu's FB post regarding PBBM's speech at the United Nation coinciding on the day of the 50th anniversary of Martial Law declaration. karma is the meaning of all these... the universe ensuring that everything is in the right order, the right audience, in the right place at the right time, one person commented. To which another netizen chimed in: karma is real.can never bring a good man/heart down! MARCOS PARIN.. that's divine justice, replied another netizen. Sa kanila ang huling halakhak ganito maglaro ang tadhana ms KLC added another. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post.

Fate is funny. Meanwhile the ""freedom fighters"" we've known all our lives are struggling for relevance. Ano meaning nito, Universe? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The DDS or diehard Duterte supporters aren't very assuming lot but VP Inday Sara Duterte is the consensus among Duterte and Marcos as the favorite to win in the 2028 presidential election. Why the confidence? Well, 32 million+ Filipinos voted VP Inday Sara Duterte in the last election so that's where the confidence of DDS is coming from. Unless, she commits a political blunder that will make the majority of the 32 million Filipinos to change their minds and turn their backs against her, which IMO will never happen. VP Inday Sara has learned a lot from ex-PRRD as a politician. Like her father, VP Sara isn't stupid to commit a blunder to make the 32 million voters turn their backs on Inday Sara. However, if you ask the supporters/sympathizers of VP Sara's rival, that 32 million isn't going to stop them from trying to slowly chip away VP Sara's 32 million strong supporters. The 32 million+ voters of VP Inday Sara Duterte is the Mt. Everest that her potential rival or rivals must climb and conquer if they wish to pull of a come from behind win in the 2028 election. No wonder, the DDS vloggers and influencers believe that the camp of VP Inday Sara's potential rival is starting very early to attempt to chip away her 32 million+ voters by discrediting her with black propaganda in the hope of diminishing her popularity to Filipino voters. DDS vlogger and influencer Mark Lopez took to Facebook to give Duterte supporters an example what I was trying to explain but failed. Lol.

Propaganda 101 by the Philstar group of Manny Pangilinan ""How to destroy and diminish the popularity of Vice President Inday Sara Duterte"" First, slant a news related to current work of VP Sec Inday, and paint it as very negative. Even as ang sinabi ng DepEd eh they made the effort to include the budget of SPED, hindi ito naisama sa NEP. But they will make sure to source and allocate funds. Pero itong ImpactLeadershipPH quote card? ""WALANG BUDGET FOR SPECIAL LEARNERS with DISABILITY!"" Tapos ang icing sa agitpropaganda?

Pinoy Trending News,"Ogie Diaz, hwag puro tsismis... This is basically the emphatic message of international relations expert and SMNI host Sass Rogando Sasot to the above-mentioned showbiz reporter and talent manager who tweeted on September 26, 2022 saying he joined 31 million Filipinos in prayer, hoping for a clear weather and a government we can depend on in times of calamity. In a Tiktok video, Sasot began by asking Ogie Diaz to elaborate what he tweeted. Sasot wasted no time in reprimanding Ogie Diaz, telling him to stop gossiping so that he will know... The next time we know, Sasot began flashing a series photos, starting with the photo of a Philippine Coast Guard personnel. She asked Ogie Diaz if he know what is the Philippine Coast Guard? If not, Sasot was generous enough to educate the showbiz reporter that the Philippine Coast Guard is part of the government. They are deployed before a typhoon make landfall to conduct search and rescue operation. If I may add, do pre-emptive evacuation. Next, Sasot flashed a photo of the Philippine Army, particularly their transport unit. They were ready even before the typhoon arrived. Next, Sasot flashed a photo of soldiers loading DSWD boxes full of relief goods to PAF helicopter and airlift these to remote areas which cannot be reached by the government's land assets. Sasot hoped that before Ogie Diaz opened his mouth, he should know first how the government runs and be a responsible Filipino and not just spread gossips. And also, she hoped the next time Ogie prays, he prays sans the sarcasm because according to Sasot, God won't to sarcastic prayers. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. One person wrote perhaps Ogie Diaz expects PBBM to do the rescue himself of the typhoon victims and they want the president to swim in the flood. baka ang ineexpect nila si PBBM ang susugod dun para irescue ang mga nasalanta ng bagyo baka ang gusto nila ang president ang lumangoy sa baha Another netizen wrote that Ogie and fellow Kakampinks understanding of a reliable government is that, the President and VP will personally visit the disaster areas for photoops with the typhoon victims. Yung understanding kasi nila sa maaasahang gobyerno, si Pres. At VP mismo pupunta dun at magpa picture sa mga nasalanta. This sentiment is echoed by another netizen. Ang alam Lang kasi nilang Gobyerno ay si PBBM Lang Gusto nila si PBBM ang gumawa lahat ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Alin ba mas importante para sa bayan at mga Pinklawan? The frustration of the admin of the Luminous FB page is very palpable at noisy Pinklawans piggybacking on the issue of SpEd (Special Education) getting no funds for 2022 from DepEd to take a jab at the concurrent DepEd Secretary and VP Inday Sara. In a previous FB post, Adrian Pascual, admin of the Luminous, took a swipe at the Pinklawans saying he was hoping those who are making a big fuss on social media regarding the zero budget of DepEd for SpEd will also be taking the lead to demand the transfer of funds appropriated for Martial Law Museum to SpEd instead. Pascual asked the critics to tell him what is more important to them? Their priorities? The Luminous FB followers have mixed reactions on Adrian Pascual's rant versus the Pinklawans but judging by the number of likes generated by the FB post, it is safe to say that majority share the OP's sentiment. One person agreed with Adrian Pascual's suggestion that Pinklawans must use their voice to call for the realignment of the budget for the Martial Museum to SpEd if indeed they are after the country's welfare. Dapat yong budget ng martial law museum e realigned nalang sa deped para sped This sentiment is also echoed by another netizen. That would be the most sensible thing to do - optimize scarce resources for the basics - agric/food security, educ'n, health, transpo needs/issues, housing, energy woes.

Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, former VP Leni Robredo has been heavily criticized, mocked even by her critics because she was caught on camera reading Pinocchio's book to high schoolers during the launching of Siembrigada Pagbasa at Pagbilang Project. BTW, Leni Robredo's Pagbasa at Pagbilang project is her pet project to address the alarming numbers of Filipinos learners in primary and secondary schools who are categorized as non-readers. Many netizens said also the same thing that Pinocchio's book is not age-appropriate hence the criticism on former VP Leni Robredo. Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza, who is back from suspension, attempted to defend VP Leni Robredo from critics in his latest FB post but instead of getting mad at him for defending Leni Robredo whom he criticized in the past, netizens simply laughed at Sonza's post.

Ms. Sasot countered that it's not true each Filipino or family has that amount of debt to pay. Ms. Sasot added that the national debt is not paid by each Filipinos. In fact, nobody in their lifetime has even paid national debt according to how it is divided by stupid journalist and equally stupid politicians. Ms. Sasot asked her readers if their parents' debt divide their debt according to the number of siblings? Ms. Sasot reiterated that dividing the national debt by the number of population is pointless because that's not how things work.

Pinoy Trending News,"VP Inday Sara Duterte Carpio's office asked for P2.3B budget for the year 2023 and in case you missed the news, Congress approved the request during the budget deliberation in just a few minutes. Critics, especially the Kakampink supporters, can't help but lament the huge disparity of the OVP budget then and now. One netizen even remarked that Robredo's budget was obviously ""inipit"" to borrow her word, by the previous Congress while the same cannot said of the current Congress who are generous in granting VP Inday Sara's request for a bigger budget. Here are some of the tweets of Leni supporters lamenting the disparity. they are actually capable of giving an over a billion budget for ovp, pero wala yun when atty leni was vp.. look at the numbers, its almost 5 times more vp leni's opening budget in 2017 In response to the noisy Kakampinks on Twitter comparing VP Inday Sara Duterte-Carpio's 2023 budget and Leni Robredo, a loyal supporter of the Dutertes will try to explain why Congress gave VP Inday Sara a huge budget for 2023 while the previous Congress did not give Leni Robredo that amount. Basically, the loyal Duterte supporter put herself in the shoes of an investor looking for an opportunity to invest her money. To make the story short, the lady investor found two businessmen who needs P200,000 and P600,000 respectively. Can you guess where she decided to put her money in? The businessman who P600,000 capital. Do you know why? According to her, she chose the latter because she has confidence the said businessman will give her a good ROI (return of investment) for her money and of course, there is an element of trust. In other words, CONFIDENCE matters. This is also the same reason why the current Congress did not hesitate to grant VP Inday Sara's request for P2.3B budget because they have faith in her. But here's what the loyal Duterte said in the end, which in my opinion, left 13,650 netizens awestruck if judging by their reactions on Facebook: ""It's not the amount, it's the value. Filipinos LOVE value. It's called worth. One is WORTHIER than the other."" By the way, the loyal supporter who penned the brilliant FB post is none other than Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu. You may now read the original FB post below. Meron akong 500k to invest. May dalawang gusto mag invest ako sa kanila. Yung isa, 200k lang daw ok na sya. Yung isa, 600k daw need nya. Binigay ko sa 600k yung money. Dinagdagan ko pa ng 400k para maging P1M kasi bilib ako sa kanya. Kasi alam ko my money is safe with her and totoong may result. Sabi nung 200k, kahit daw 20k nalang invest ko sa kanya. Sabi ko Kahit 2k hindi ako mag i-invest, because she doesn't deserve the 2k because wala akong bilib sa kanya at sa kompanya nya. Kahit 200 ayoko. And that is why nobody cares about the disparity between the 900 million and the P2.3 billion. Something is only expensive if it's wasted on the wrong people. This is what we call value for money. It's not the amount, it's the value. Filipinos LOVE value. It's called worth. One is WORTHIER than the other. ",1

Cacanindin said in jest that the country's economy needs to bottom out first before we can start climbing back again to the road to recovery because essentially this is the spirit of PBBM's campaign slogan. But before that, another Luminous admin made the courtesy of deflating whatever self-confidence Cacanindin has for writing such preposterous piece of tweet against PBBM admin. Adrian Pascual, the other Luminous admin, responded to Cacanindin's tweet point by point. First, Adrian Pascual debunked Gerry Cacanindin's claim that the PBBM admin added P96B to our national debt in July when external or internal debt cannot be processed in just a month.

Pinoy Trending News,"Told you so. This is essentially what International relations expert Ms. Sass Rogando Sasot was trying to say in her latest FB post after Atty. Leni Robredo made a 180-degree turn with regards to her policy on trolls. Turned out, Ms. Sasot, she has been saying all along that Atty. Robredo's brand is lacking consistency which unfortunately her people do not care about. Atty. Leni Robredo engaging trolls after declaring she is unaffected by trolls hence she does not respond to them is proof of her inconsistency. Meanwhile, Ms. Sasot's message to Atty. Leni Robredo is to have consistency. If she said so she is unaffected by trolls, the logical thing to do is to not even them at all.

Fast forward...today, ang mga sinsasabi pa rin ng mga ""trolls"" sa kanya raw. And her awards? She herself compares them to what she said trolls kept calling her.

Imagine, nauna pa syang bigyan ng attensyon ng Dyos kaysa sa mga nasa laylayan? What have I been telling you that's lacking in Leni's brand? Which her people don't care about? Consistency. If you declare you are not affected by trolls, then the logical thing to do is to not even mention them at all, even what they say about you: if something is out of your mind, it should be out of your mouth.

Pinoy Trending News,"Recently, former VP Atty. Leni Robredo was interviewed and the highlight of the said interview was her response when asked about her thoughts on the so-called ""trolls"" calling her ""lutang"", ""Madumb"" and ""bobo"". According to the former VP, when trolls kept calling her ""Madumb"", Ateneo gave her an honorary degree. Do you think Ateneo will give someone who is ""lutang"" and ""bobo"" a degree? Robredo asked. ""I don't think so."" Robredo answered her own question. ""And now, it is not just Ateneo but also Harvard."" ""Not to sound like bragging but I feel this is God's answer to trolls."" Robredo said in an emphatic tone. Meanwhile on Facebook, Atty. Ahmed Paglinawan aka agp just burst Leni Robredo's bubble. How? Atty. Ahmed countered that being an honorary degree recipient does not necessarily mean she is awarded because of intelligence and academic excellence. He said Atty. Leni Robredo's line of thinking Ateneo gave her a honorary degree because she is intelligent is wrong. Atty. Ahmed said the Latin word honoris causa literally means ""just for the sake of honor"" not because the honoree is excellent in academics. Atty. Ahmed said he knew people who never set foot in school but being granted honorary degrees. They were honored not for their ""intelligence"" but for some other reason that honorary community deemed valuable to society as a whole. Atty.

Ahmed's original FB post. I was just about ready to cut this woman some slack. But here she is again. Does she realize that by saying this, she just affirmed what people really think of her? Honoris Causa is latin for ""just for the sake of the honor"". It clearly does not explicitly or implicitly mean the honoree is excellent in academics. I've seen people who've never spent a day in school being granted honorary degrees. They were honored not for their ""intelligence"" but for some other thing they've done that the honoring community decided was valuable to it. And in their ensuing speeches, they never once intimated that they think they were smart because of the said honor. Which is to say, this woman is...

In the said FB post, Ms. Sasot clarified that she has no issue with the DSWD Secretary forging an alliance with the Dilawans/Kakampinks like Leni Robredo whom she called ""mamshie"" in line with PBBM's message of ""unity"" during the campaign period. However, Ms. Sasot appealed to DSWD Secretary Erwin Tulfo not to forget that the group of Leni Robredo were the ones who called the BBM supporters who fought for BBM trolls and fake news peddlers. Ms. Sasot warned Secretary Tulfo to do not turn his back on the political base of the BBM admin by welcoming easily the woman who accused BBM as the one behind the fake s$x scand@l video of Aika Robredo. Ms. Sasot ended the FB post asking Sec. Tulfo if Leni Robredo calling the supporters of BBM trolls did escape his memory? You may now read Ms. Sass Rogando Sasot's original FB post below. Sec.

Pero hwag po sana natin munang kalimutan na yang grupo nina mamshie rin ang tumatawag na mga trolls at fake news peddlers ang mga supporters at bloggers na nakipaglaban para kay BBM. Don't turn your back on the political base of the BBM admin to welcome so easily the woman who accused BBM as the one behind the fake sex scandal videos of Aika Robredo.

Pinoy Trending News,"In case you missed it, Leni Robredo has changed her FB page from VP Leni Robredo to Atty. Leni Robredo. This is expected since she is no longer the Vice President. In light of this development, Adrian Pascual, admin of the FB page Luminous, dared Atty. Leni Robredo to prove she is deserving to call herself ""Atty"". How? Simple. Take on cases and clients where in she will stand as the lead counsel and argue the case before a judge of the court. Pascual proceeded to ask hypothetical questions to netizens whether Leni's allies who have cases in court is amenable to the idea of the former VP and now Atty. Leni Robredo acting as their lead counsel. Pascual remarked that challenging Atty. Leni Robredo to prove mettle as a lawyer is just fair. Pascual ended the FB post by encouraging Atty. Leni Robredo to take the challenge. You may now read Adrian Pascual's original FB post below. Since nag rebranding na si Leni ng may ""Atty."" sa FB account niya, dapat siguro patunayan niya na abogada na siya talaga no? At hindi ito branding gimik lang. Dapat siguro kumuha na siya ng mga kaso o mga kliente na siya mismo ang tatayo na lead counsel at makikipag talo sa hukuman. 1. Papayag kaya si Leila na si Leni na mag takeover ng kaso niya at tatayong lead counsel niya? 2. Papayag kaya si Ressa na si Leni na tatayong lawyer niya kasi mukhang lagi naman palpak si Ted? 3. Kukunin kaya siyang lead legal consultant ni Risa sa senado? 4. Mag pafile ba siya ng mga petitions sa SC ukol sa mga kaso o mga policies ng gobyerno na ayaw niya at siya mismo ang mag argue sa SC para ito ay mapatigil o mapawalang bisa? Fair lang naman siguro na ichallenge siya na patunayan ang galing niya, diba? Go go go Atty. Leni Robredo!!! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"It is not surprising that showbiz reporter and vlogger Ogie Diaz will come running to Leni Robredo's defense after Lifestyle magazine editor Christine Cunanan took a jab at the former VP's graduating speech she delivered to the graduates of Ateneo de Manila University Loyala campus recently. In the said FB post, Cunanan asked her followers if they also had a hard time decoding part of Leni Robredo's speech. It can be recalled that Christine Cunanan was the founder of the ABL (Anybody But Leni) movement on Facebook during the height of the 2022 presidential campaign. On Twitter, showbiz reporter Ogie Diaz said he is not surprised of Cunanan's criticism of Leni Robredo because haters gonna hate no matter what, questions her every move, find issues with her. Just like Cunanan's brain, we need to look for it, Diaz joked. If Ogie Diaz got Leni Robredo's back, Adrian Pascual, one of the admins of the Luminous, also got Christine Cunanan's back so to speak. In a Facebook post, Pascual defended Cunanan from Ogie Diaz's insults on Twitter, saying that Cunanan's brain works that way because of her rigorous academic training and decades of experience as a writer for for international publication. The same cannot be said of the rigidity of showbiz gossip and very low standard writing Ogie Diaz is accustomed to. Pascual agreed with Cunanan's observation that Leni's speech, part of her speech, was indeed challenging to decipher because the former VP was not talking to someone like Ogie Diaz. According to him, Cunanan was simply asking her readers the question of coherence of the thought and writing processes of Leni's speech. Pascual joked that Leni was either writing using codes or in some moronic language. Pascual turned his attention once again to Ogie Diaz and said that his palengkera style of writing won't pass the standard of lifestyle writers, especially editors like Ms. Cunanan. Ouch! You may now read Adrian Pascual's original FB post below. Ganon talaga The Ogie Diaz kasi ang utak ni Christine Cunanan ay na train sa academic rigor at decades of experience in writing international standard content for her international publication and other known international publications, brands, and organizations. Hindi kagaya sa rigidity ng showbiz chismis and very low standard of writing na kaya mo lang ilabas sa mundong ito. Real talk lang po ha. Mahirap mo maarok talaga ano ibig niyang sabihin kasi hindi naman siya nagsasalita sa o para sa mga kagaya mo. For your own benefit, sisimplehan ko ha. She was simply asking her readers the question of coherence sa thought and writing processes ng speech ni Leni (na very questionable). Either Leni wrote it using codes or in some moronic language kasi. Hindi pupwede yung palengkera style mo sa mga travel and lifestyle writers, lalo na sa mga editors na gaya ni Ms. Cunanan. Yun lang po yun. Sana medyo naintindihan mo na kasi Pilipino naman mostly ginamit ko dito with hints of Binisaya diction. ",1

Tutulong daw ang volunteers ng Angat Buhay para magbigay ng information sa DSWD tuwing may sakuna. Ano po ang added value nyan? Hindi ba sapat ang info gathering ng LGUs kaya kailangan maging middle man kayo? Walang cellphones mga tao para direkta sila sa DSWD? Tamad ba field workers ng DSWD? Hindi ba gumagalaw ang military na nagrerelay talaga ng info, at mas reliable pa? Walang capacity any coast guards? Yung info ba from your volunteers eh magiging iba sa info na ibibigay nila? Sasot's point was well-taken by her FB followers and offered their own theories why Leni Robredo wants to have a tie up with DSWD. One netizen held no punches and exposed Leni Robredo's motivation in hooking up DSWD. kasi po kapag member ng angat buhay ang source of infos ay syempre ""kasama name ni madam"" yun po ang rason...in short si madam ang bida...si PBBM walang silbi.

For context, in 2019, PRRD was awarded an honorary doctorate by the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations.

This netizen appealed to Ms. Sasot and fellow anti-Leni Robredo to let this pass because correcting them is an exercise in futility because people like them who are ""educated"" seems they haven't learned anything at all.

Do you know why? Because, aside from the reasons cited above, they want PBBM to emulate PRRD's strongman persona but to their dismay, Marcos isn't keen granting their wish. But thanks to Marcos loyalist and Bicolano vlogger Edwin Jamora who wrote a reassuring words to counter whatever doubts the Duterte supporters who are now calling PBBM weak because he is not copying ex- PRRD's strongman image in a Facebook post published recently. Here's what Jamora wrote: I saw friends asking PBBM to be a strongman! PBBM is weak daw. I disagree with them. PBBM grew up with the Master. He was trained from Day 1. He's been in politics since birth. Besides, he is Machiavellian. That alone should give you comfort. Tse! Netizens who read Edwin Jamora's defense of PBBM against ""weak leader"" label has offered their own take on the issue. One netizen shared what his Ilocanos friend told him about PBBM. Sabi ng isang taga Ilocos, dati nilang Congressman si PBBM, he's a silent doer daw. Kaya wag mangamba. A second appealed to Duterte Diehard supporters to stop the deception. Being gentle doesn't mean PBBM is weak. Those who really voted for his leadership have full trust and confidence in him to lead the nation. Enough is enough to deceptions. A third said that PBBM is similar to his father, calculating but more cautious. Lahat nang kilos ng mga marcos's calculated yan... gaya ng patibong ni PBBM sa mga taga DA. Binigyan nya ng power para makita nya kung anu gagawin. Yung iba kasi REACTORS na vloggers e ma mema na lang. Parang si FEM din si Pbbm pero mas maingat na sya. A fourth commenter shared what he read from a former general blogger who said PBBM is utilizing his Scout Ranger training in tackling the national issues. A former general blogger says PBBM looks like he's using his former training as a special forces scout ranger with stealth and deception instead of direct frontal attacks. One should also remember that Sebastian had been an USec of former Sec Dar. Nalusutan nila si PRRD kaya kala nila mas malulusutan nila si PBBM pero nabisto ang kanilang modus! ",1

Contreras give DSWD Secretary Tulfo a heads up of a possible backlash from the 31M if he decides to work with Robredo. DSWD Sec Erwin Tulfo walang tiwala sa mga LGUs at mga teachers. Pero kung sakali, sa Pink Nanay at sa Angat Buhay NGA niya meron? Grabe naman ang pagdududa ni Sec Tulfo sa mga LGUs at mga teachers. Remember Sec Tulfo ang backlash ng 31M Filipinos pag ikaw naki-tie up sa Angat Buhay. You will feel the wrath of those who supported PBBM. Another Marcos Loyalist and social media influencer named Mark lan finds no problem with the possibility of the DSWD linking up with Robredo's Angat Buhay. Para sa akin, walang masama dito. Kahit sinong gustong tumulong sa pamahalaan ay hindi dapat kinokontra. Mas maraming tulong, mas mainam ! Mas madaming makikinabang. Ang magandang pagtanggap ng DSWD ay pagpapakita lamang din na seryoso si Pangulong Bongbong Marcos sa kanyang panawagan, ito ay ang pagkakaisa kahit ano man ang iyong kulay sa pulitika.

Tulfo's statement did not sit well with some netizens, including Dr. Ethel Pineda, a radio host and social media influencer. In a Facebook post, Dr. Pineda asked DSWD Secretary if he was serious of his allegation against the teachers. Dr. Pineda was apparently pissed because Secretary Tulfo was quick to accuse teachers of misdeeds and apparently for his distrust of teachers who live in the community where he or she teaches. Dr. Pineda remarked that Secretary Tulfo's behavior is unacceptable and he should be ashamed of himself. Dr. Pineda was hopeful that VP Sara Duterte will not take this sitting down as well and take up the cudgels on behalf of the teachers. Netizens have mixed reactions on Secretary Tulfo's statement.

Ms. Chu said that the supporters of the Opposition including celebs like Juday and Cherry Pie are very passionate about onions and sugar, particularly white onions.

Ms. Chu warned the supporters of PBBM and VP Sara to brace for more attacks on these departments in the next 5 years from the Opposition because they are not interested in nation building but to hit PBBM and VP Sara where it causes more damage - their personal projects. If I may add, the Opposition will attempt to cause as much damage against VP Sara and chip away her popularity until the 2028 election and derail the VP's presidential bid, in case she will not change her mind and run for President.

It's because PBBM and VPSD are heading these departments. Gird for the next 6 years na super involved at may care ang tao sa education at agriculture the way super care sila sa mga human rights ng drug addicts the last six years.

Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the merger of TVS and ABS-CBN, supporters of the Kapamilya network have every reason to be jubilant because that means their favorite network is returning to free TV via TV5 frequency sooner than they expected. However, the marriage between TV5 and ABS-CBN appears to be on the rocks even before they get to enjoy their honeymoon? Why? Here's what political writer Mr. Raymond Satnamul revealed in his Facebook post dated August 14, 2022. According to Mr. Raymond Satnamul, Executive Order No. 546 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. mandated the NTC ""to supervise and regulate, among others, radio and television broadcast stations to encourage a larger and more effective and efficient use of radio and television (RTV) broadcasting facilities and to maintain effective competition."" Another gem found by Mr. Raymond Satnamul is the most recent Executive Order drafted by the NTC last June 2022 which in my opinion, further gave teeth to the NTC with explicit instruction to prohibit mergers and acquisitions with those who have outstanding obligations to the national government and local government units. Mr. Raymond Satnamul shared a Filipino sayings regarding 'third wheels' having an accompanying glitches. On that note, Mr. Raymond Satnamul ended the FB post urging the NTC Commissioner to scrap the ABS- CBN-TV5 deal. You may now read Mr. Raymond Satnamul's original FB post below for a detailed explanation of his assertion. MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS It seems that the recently done 'marriage deal' between TV5 and ABS-CBN is about to be ruined, spoiled or thrown in the garbage bin. Last Thursday, ABS-CBN signed an agreement with TVS allowing it to acquire 6.46 million primary common shares, equivalent to 34.99% of capital and voting stock of the latter for P2.16 billion. Following the acquisition of shares, the equity of MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., headed by Manny V. Pangilinan - which operates TV5, will be trimmed to 64.79% of voting and capital stock. For me, this is a classic example of the metaphor - ""if you can't make it at the front door, do it at the back door."" Cleverly, ABS-CBN has entered into blocktime agreements with Zoe Broadcasting Network and TV5 for some of its shows to return to free TV since its broadcast operations were shut down following the denial of its franchise application in 2020. Is there a violation with all of these transactions? Here's my humble opinion.  According to Executive Order (E.O.) No. 546, signed by President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos in 1979, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is mandated ""to supervise and regulate, among others, radio and television broadcast stations to encourage a larger and more effective and efficient use of radio and television (RTV) broadcasting facilities and to maintain effective competition."" In a Memorandum Order drafted by the NTC last June 2022, section 2 provides that ""In addition to the conditions and limitations provided in the grantees' legislative franchise on mergers and acquisitions, the grantee shall NOT enter into mergers, joint venture agreements, sale, or any other commercial agreements/arrangements on matters within the Commission's mandate and jurisdiction, such as transfer of authority and sale/use of NTC regulated equipment, with those who have outstanding obligations to the national government and local government units."" I repeat... NOT to enter into mergers and acquisitions, joint venture agreements, sale...with those who have outstanding obligations with the national government. In other words, 'basta kabit, talagang may sabit. Scrap the deal! Commissioner Gamaliel! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"When a photo of former President Rodrigo Duterte visiting Harley Davidson Manila made the rounds on social media, his rabid critics, mostly Pinklawans went overdrive in making innuendos that the former President is now shopping for his favorite hobby - motorcycles - thanks to kickbacks from government contracts during his presidency. Of course, such innuendos from the Pinklawans do not sit will with staunch Duterte supporters like social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes who immediately took to Facebook to defend the former President. In fairness to the Pinklawan critics, the former President indeed went shopping for new motorcycle but contrary to their malicious insinuation that ex-PRRD spent taxpayers' money or kickback from government contracts to buy his new toy, Reyes said the former president purchased it using his lump sum pension. Here's what Reyes wrote on Facebook: PRRD got his retirement pay a month or so ago. ""Totoo pala,"" kwento nya (sabay naki-maritess na rin kami kung magkano natanggap). If I'm not mistaken, this is the big bike (or is it big trike?) that PRRD got for himself promptly after receiving his retirement/pension. Katas ito ng ilang dekadang pani-nerbisyo nya sa bayan. ctto PH Here are some of the comments of netizens below. One netizen slammed the Pinklawans for accusing the former President of using stolen money from the taxpayers to pay for the motorcycle. Tapos chismis sa kabila ninakaw daw pera. As if naman walang sweldo ang presidente Another netizen expressed disinterest what the other camp against the former President. He believes ex- PRRD deserved the new motorcycle. Anumang sabihin nila... he deserves it for his utmost dedication in serving our country A third echoed the sentiment of the above commenter. He deserved it naman tlaga Kasi super sipag n tatay digong someday ma.meet ko din sya Inshallah A Generally, Reyes' FB followers have nothing but love and support for the former President. In fact, out of the 9,654 reactors, only 1 netizen hit the angry emoticon. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Former Vice President Leni Robredo gave glowing review of the movie Katips, calling it a ""wonderful piece"". Robredo added that Katips is yet another proof that art is integral in the way we shape the world. Robredo shifted to Tagalog and continued her endorsement of Katips to the Pinoy moviegoers and read: Mahalaga ang mensahe dala ng pelikula...sa panahon pilit na binabago...ang kasaysayan at marami...ang napapaniwala sa kasinungalingan. (The message conveyed by the movie is important...at a time when history is being revised forcefully and many are convinced to believe the lies.) Radio host and vlogger Mark Lopez, one of the harshest critics of Leni Robredo even when she was the Vice President, can only arrive with the same conclusion that the former VP is still boba then and now. Lopez offered 2 theories how Leni Robredo came up with glowing review of Katips. First, she did not really watch Katips but said something to stay relevant. Second, she indeed watched the movie but she did understand it and for the sake of relevance, she has to say something. Let us read the comments of netizens below and see if they agree with Lopez. One netizen commented that Mark hit the nail right on its head and wanted to say the same thing. Lahat ng binanggit mo Sir Mark ay puros tumbok at yan din sana sasabihin ko A second netizen said Robredo's statements were vague and he knew the former VP was simply playing safe. Very vague sentiments. Alam mong play-safe lang mga take aways niya. Tama nga, either di napanood, napanood pero di naiintindihan or naki-marites lang sa SocMed. A third netizen doubted Leni Robredo did watch the movie unless there is a photo of her in the theater or watching it on her laptop. If she watched Katips, how come there is no photo of her in the theater? If she saw it on her laptop, there still ought to be a photo. You may now read Mark Lopez's brief FB post below. Dalawang bagay- Either hindi naman nya napanood talaga at nag me mema lang para maging relevant... Or napanood nya pero hindi nya naintindihan at mema lang sya para maging relevant. Having said that, isa lang ang malinaw - Boba noon, Boba ngayon. ",1

Espiritu's allegation like a fly that the libel case against his Walden Bello is politically motivated. Why? VP Sec Sara Duterte has nothing to gain by suing Walden Bello. Atty. Nick accused Atty. Espiritu and his ilk of having this illusion that Bello, the tail ender in the vice presidential race, and VP Sara Duterte are in the same league. Atty. Nick asked Atty. Espiritu whether the complainant in the libel case (Jeffrey Tupas) and VP Sara Duterte are one and the same person? If there is anyone worthy of condemnation, it is but the likes of Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"Radio host and vlogger Mark Lopez can only raise his eyebrows, figuratively speaking, in reaction to Senator Nancy Binay preaching to the public in general and to Darryl Yap in particular, director of the movie 'Maid in Malacanang' the importance of truth-telling to the healing of a nation. According to the senator, imaginary events can never be history. Historical trueness will always prevail over historical fiction. The path to healing a nation begins at truth-telling. Speaking of truth-telling, Lopez offered an unsolicited advice to Senator Nancy Binay and that is, stop dipping her fingers in the discussion about truth-telling. Otherwise, the public will start taking interest again and ask questions regarding the origin of her family's wealth. Here are some of the comments of netizens in reaction to Senator Nancy Binay's statement. One netizen echoed Mark Lopez's advice to the senator from Makati. Truth telling will put ur family in trouble! Mag suggest ka na lang batas na makaka tulong sa mga Pilipino. 090 A second netizen said the Binays are simply deflecting the attention of the public to the Marcoses by telling the pubic not to forget them. If the people starts scrutinizing the Binays and see for what they really are, they will follow the footsteps of the Aquinos and out of power. Of course never forget kasi after Marcos, nakilala ang mga Binay. If people see and realized the real them, they will be next to the Aquinos, out of power. A third commenter can only laugh at Nancy Binay for being oblivious that the dark reputation of all members of the Binay family are as dark as their skin. Ahahahah nakakamangha din kase nakakalimot ata lahat ng myembro ng pamilya ng Binay na kasing itim nila ang reputasyon nila sa pulitika hahahaha Finally, this netizen's comment regarding the Binays made my day.

Pinoy Trending News,"Veteran movie director and actor Manuel Castaneda was apparently happy for the success of Darryl Yap's 'Maid in Malacanang' movie. In a Facebook post, Castaneda said he has no doubt the movie Maid in Malacang is a box office hit. However in a surprising twist, Castaneda thanked the Dilawans, the communist and all the anti-Marcos groups for the free publicity, hence its success. He said because of their over the top epal, the Marcos camp benefited from the attention-grabbing noise they created. Of course, Castaneda also thanked MIM (Maid in Malacanang) whom he credited for reviving the local movie industry after a long period of dormancy due to the pandemic. The Filipinos, Castaneda said, have regain their enthusiasm to go to the movie theaters. Castaneda confessed in the end that he has yet to watch MIM but not because he does not like it but because he ran out of tickets of the time he preferred to watch it. But he promised to come back the following day to watch it. You may now read Manuel Castaneda's original FB post below. There's no doubt Maid in Malacanang is a box office hit. Salamat sa mga dilawan, komunista at iba pang mga anti Marcos for giving it more than enough publicity. Dahil sa kanilang sobrang epal, yung kabilang kampo ang nakinabang. Salamat din sa MIM ay binuhay nito ang industriya ng pelikulang pilipino pagkatapos ng mahabang pahinga dahil sa pandemya. Ganado uli ang mga Pinoy na manood ng sine.

She thanked God for Boracay but forgot to thank PRRD who made Boracay beautiful again. Twitter influencer and anti-Dilawan blogger named The Buried Lead by Ramon Ortoll quickly jumped in opportunity to call out Mae Paner, whom he accused of creating a lot of noise on social media protesting against the Boracay closure for rehabilitation, for being an ingrate. But now that the closure turned out to be roaring success, these critics can't even acknowledge Duterte for bringing back Boracay to its glorious days! Bicolano vlogger Edwin Jamora, who is a rabid anti-Dilawan, a Duterte supporter and Marcos loyalist joined Ramon Ortoll of the The Buried Lead in criticizing Mae Paner aka Juana Change, but this time on Facebook. Jamora urged Mae Paner to read aloud a short message he prepared for her thanking former President Duterte for her enjoyable Boracay experience. Repeat after me, Mae Paner!

Radio host and vlogger Mark Lopez made such remark while reposting the official statement of Vice President Inday Sara Duterte for the indulgence of his followers on Facebook. Lopez's FB followers reacted positively to Lopez's FB declaring undying support for VP Inday Sara Duterte. In fact, of the 9,500 reactors to Lopez's FB post, only 1 netizen dared to hit the angry emoji. The same FB post also generated 419 comments and 632 shares in just 16 hours and counting. Here are some of the comments from netizens, in reaction to VP Inday Sara Duterte's declaration to spearhead the campaign in ending Makabayan Bloc's reign of deception of the Filipino public. One netizen expressed gratitude to God for giving VP Inday Sara to the Filipinos as the voice against terrorism and recruitment of children by the NPAs. Salamat Paniginoon at binigyan ninyo sa amin si VP Inday Sara, ang aming boses against terrorism and recruitment sa mga kabataan. Mag GOD be always with you VP Inday Sara! A second commenter can't help but take a swipe at National Security Adviser Prof. Clarita Carlos, saying that if she can't speak out against Makabayan Bloc, VP Inday can. If Prof. Carlos can't. Our VP Inday CAN Kaisa kami sa inyong pinaglalaban. Hindi kami nagkamali na iluklok ka bilang Bise Presidente. This netizen also called the attention of Prof. Carlos to tell her this is how to do it. Calling the attention of Sec. CLARITA CARLOS. Ganyan po ang statement, DIRETSO at hindi puro malalalim na english na hindi naman maintindihan ng marami. Nice!

I kinda like that. You may now read VP Inday Sara Duterte's statement below. I always have time for Makabayan bloc. The laugh that I get reading Makabayan bloc's hypocritical and dramatically rehashed statements - while thinking about how the Filipino people rejected the bid of Bayan Muna and two other Makabayan bloc partylist groups to once again infiltrate Congress and legitimize their existence while pretending that we do no know about their 'love affair' with the NPA, the NDFP and the CPP- is a way to de-stress from all the challenges the Department of Education and the government need to address without the help of Makabayan bloc, of course. Marami na ang naloko ng Makabayan bloc. Magaling sila sa propaganda at sanay sila sa pagsisinungaling. Sa loob ng maraming panahon, walang naglakas-loob na ilabas ang katotohanan tungkol sa kanila. Gagawin natin ito ngayon. Ilang batang Pilipino na ang kanilang nahikayat na sumanib sa NPA para sumali sa isang gyera na hindi naman nauunawaan ng mga kabataan - isang gyera na hinding-hindi nila maipapanalo dahil isa itong gyera na laban sa kapwa nila mga Pilipino. Ilang pangarap at magandang kinabukasan na rin ba ng mga kabataan na ba ang hinayaan ng Makabayan bloc na masira sa loob ng maraming mga taon? Ilang kabataan na ba ang namatay bilang NPA? Ang pagsasabi ng katotohanan tungkol sa relasyon ng Makabayan bloc at sa teroristang NPA, CPP, at NDFP ay hindi red-tagging o terror-tagging- ito ay pagsasabi lamang ng katotohanan.

Pinoy Trending News,"When asked how he was doing during plenary debates, Senator Robinhood Padilla confessed to reporters that he is experiencing difficulty following because his colleagues normally engage debates in English. 'Nahihirapan lang ako. Pwede dahan-dahan lang?"" the neophyte senator told reporters. Senator Robinhood Padilla's confession made it to the headlines of the Inquirer, giving his critics the opening to make a mockery out of him, especially the rabid supporters of the Kakampinks like Audie Gemora who felt strongly that their senatorial bets, you know who they are, were deserving of a senate slot more than the action star and neophyte senator. On Twitter, the stage, television, film actor and singer Audie Gemora wasted no time in throwing shades at the supporters of the former and the incumbent administrations how wrong they were in sending a kinder- gardener (kindergarten is the correct term) in graduate school and expect the class to adjust? Perhaps due to Gemora's eagerness to put Senator Robin Padilla to shame and at the same time, make the neophyte senator's supporters cringe in embarrassment for voting somebody whom Gemora thinks is unqualified because of Mr. Padilla's non-mastery of the English language when compared with Kakampink senatorial bets, he also put himself in an embarrassing situation. In other words, his attempt to embarrass Senator Robinhood Padilla backfired! To understand what I was talking about, you may now read MJ Quiambao Reyes' original FB post below. To Mr. Gemora & to others who think & tweet like him: Una, bago po kayo mang insulto, siguruhin n'yo po muna na tama ang spelling nyo ng KINDERGARTNER para di ka naman nakakahiya. Pangalawa, hindi sukatan ng talino at competence ang galing sa pananalita ng wikang banyaga. [Otherwise, ano na lang ang magiging tingin sa iyo Audie now that you can't even spell a simple word correctly?] Pangatlo, ang pagiging mapagkumbaba at ang pagmamahal sa sariling wika ay hindi kailanman kabobohan o kakulangan ng kakayahan magsilbi sa bayan. Isinusulong ni Sen. Robin Padilla ang pag gamit ng sariling wika hindi lang dahil sa doon sya mas bihasa at mas kumportable kundi dahil gusto rin nyang mas maunawaan ng nakararaming mamamayan ang mga mahahalagang isyung pinagdedebatehan sa senado. Tulad ng sabi sa amin mismo ni PRRD noong July 18 (if my memory serves me right): ""Mahusay man yan talaga si Robin. That guy can express himself in English if he wants to. Pero gusto nya talagang gamitin ang Filipino. Bakit naman hindi."" [Oo, SRP, pinag chismisan ka namin ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"So what did exactly former Bayan Muna Representative say about VP Sara Duterte wearing a Lumad attire during the first SONA of President Bongbong Marcos Jr? Basically, Eufemia Cullamat said everybody is welcome to borrow their Lumad attire blah. blah. But, VP Sara must recognize their rights and advocacies. According to Cullamat, VP Sara wearing the Lumad attire is nonsense and just for show because she red- tagged the students and teachers of the Lumad schools. Cullamat accused VP Sara Duterte of terrorizing and evicting the Lumads in their sanctuary in Davao City. As predicted, VP Sara did not take Cullamat's remarks sitting down and immediately launch a scorching offensive, literally tearing Cullamat into several pieces before getting razed down to the ground. In her official statement, VP Sara Duterte said she wore the traditional Bagobo Tagabawa dress to pay tribute to one of the tribes that comprises the 11 groups of Davao City, apart from the Christians. In addition, it was a show solidarity with the Lumads of Mindanao and many other IPs all over the country who have been uprising against the NPAs for the chronic exploitation of their children, arming them as new recruits never mind if they are minors and unable to comprehend the madness of terrorism espoused by the NPAs. In short, VP Sara wore the Bagobo dress during a widely televised public occasion to raise awareness of the plight of our Lumad brothers and sisters throughout the country who are the victims of the NPA atrocities if they don't cooperate with them by rejecting their ideology. Finally, VP Sara went for the jugular by telling Cullamat that as a mother of a dead NPA fighter, she should apologize to her daughter for sending her to her untimely gruesome demise. The last part of VP Sara Duterte's statement made the solid Duterte supporters cheering for the VP, including radio host Mark Lopez and Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu. Mark Lopez wrote: Leeches like EUFEMIA CULLAMAT should really be put in their proper place. Thank God that we have a courageous Vice President who stands up to evil like Cullamat. With VP Inday Sara Duterte, the future of this country, and our children, is brighter than ever. Krizette Chu wrote: Eufemia Cullamat, who sent her own child to death by teaching her the wrong ideology and is FULLY RESPONSIBLE for the death of her own child for brainwashing her, gets a tongue lashing from VP SARA DUTERTE. How painful must it be to be reminded that you're the reason your child died. Or not, if you don't have a heart Here are some of the nice words from netizens... VP Inday Sara is not PRRD's daughter for nothing. The fruit does not fall far from the tree, wrote one netizen. VP Sara is really good with words. A great prospective leader of our country in 2028. She is evolving as a season politician, ok ang timing niya sa mga isyu. Magaling sasagot, remarked another. A third described VP Sara's statement ""savage"". She devoured Cullamat entirely.

Pinoy Trending News,"Some of the so-called solid Duterte supporters are very vocal with their disappointment of PBBM on social media because he did not blurt out expletives to show his disgust against the criminals, drug lords, corrupt politicians and government people during his first SONA like what then President Duterte did. Are you one of the so-called solid Duterte supporters who supported PBBM in the last election because you were expecting continuity including PRRD's style of expressing himself but now a little disappointed? Well, of your answer is ""YES"", Atty. Darwin Canete, one of President Duterte's staunch defenders on social media during his time as President, has a timely message for you. What works for PRRD will not work for PBBM. He should not even try because it is dishonest. He should be himself and govern his way. Mar Roxas tried to curse and it made him look stupid and pretentious. The best way to emulate PRRD is his authenticity and love of country. And for me, you can have essence without necessarily duplicating the form. Here are some of the comments on the FB thread of Atty. Darwin. One netizen commented that we are called individuals for the simple reason we are not the same. That's why we are called individuals because we are different from each other. We have our own ways in making things happen. I hope pro-dds ani-marcos will give him a chance. This sentiment is echoed by the netizen below and defended PBBM saying he is not weak but just soft spoken and a good person. Indeed...hindi pantay ang ating mga daliri...ganun din bawat tao hindi pareho ng style at pag uugali. Wag nating piliting baguhin si PBBM...mas relax at gamay nya ang kilos nya mas magiging maayos ang trabaho nya...PLS LANG SA MGA GUSTO CYANG IKUMPARA O ITULAD KAY PRRD. Ask nyo na lang sarili nyo kung gusto ba ninyo kung sa inyo yan gawin! PBBM is not weak... HE IS JUST SOFT SPOKEN AND REALLY MABAIT. Makikita mo yan agad sa kilos at mga mata nya. Finally, this netizen perfectly articulated the sentiment of many PBBM supporters in light of the criticism coming from the so-called DDS. PBBM is NOT PRRD. Magkaiba sila ng style. Parang essay lang yan, puwedeng same essence but two students will write in different way. They will express their thoughts and insight differently but the same idea. Si PRRD, masa talaga. si PBBM yamanin. si PRRD, patola. si PBBM, deadma. Pero they both have the good of the nation in their hearts and mind. they became leader at different times and with different priorities and circumstances. yung naayos ni PRRD, hindi na urgent need ni PBBM. iba ang urgent sa times ni PBBM. yung law and order, nagawa ni PRRD. i am surre, PBBM wants to MAINTAIN. kaya hindi na yan nasa focus. but does not mean he is not concerned about it. just because hindi nabanggit sa SONA doesn't mean he is not giving it attention. hindi lang urgent priority kasi ongoing na and ok naman. hindi din naman maganda na yung priority ni PRRD e yun pa rin ang need sa time ni PBBM. ibig sabihin, hindi effective si PRRD kaya even after 6 years, urgent need pa rin siya. let's give them both credit. PRRD left his post with our country in a better place than when he first sat as president. this is why PBBM now can shift a bit of his focus to something else. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Leni Robredo's tweet praising DSWD Secretary Erwin Tulfo for his quick response by visiting the quake- ravaged areas in Northern Luzon has prompted a staunch Duterte supporter and social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes to share their conversation with former President Duterte in Davao City. According to Reyes, they asked PRRD regarding his plans, like whether he'll serve as PBBM's adviser and their astonishment, the former President replied he is not interested because his time is done. The former President even said that making a comment on the Marcos administration is not in his plans. Reyes praised PRRD for surely knowing his place and only wants the new admin to shine and succeed. Reyes ended the brief FB post by sharing her wish about Mrs. Robredo having the same mindset with former President Duterte.

Here's how netizens react to MJ Reyes' FB post. She's epal to the max trying to stay relevant, commented Benjie Contreras, a staunch Marcos supporter. Another netizen commented that Robredo must have been drowned by the importance showered on her during stint as VP. Mahilig masyado po sa limelight. Nalunod masyado sa importansya na binigay during her stint as VP and campaign. Haays nde na maka move Another wrote that Leni is simply lacking wisdom.

While the supporters of the former VP saw nothing wrong with private citizen Leni Robredo praising DSWD Sec. Erwin Tulfo, many citizens, including Publicus Asia Founder and Political strategist Malou Tiquia, think otherwise. Here's the original FB post of Malou Tiquia below. Totally uncalled for!

A second netizen expressed disbelief why some Pinoys are laughing at VP Sara showing love to our indigenous brethren's culture. I don't see there's something wrong that they should laugh at this. That is how our VP is loving our country & our culture & the Filipino people. This is a symbol of patriotism, loyalty & love for our indigenous brothers & sisters. Mabuhay ka Inday Sara! A third remarked that the comments of some Pinoy netizens is the impetus to recalibrate our knowledge of Filipino arts and culture. There must be a recalibration in our knowledge of Filipino arts and culture. Some can't even distinguished which is just for entertainment and a tribal costume that must be respected. Meanwhile, some netizens did not let the opportunity to pass without taking a swipe of their hypocrisy, like this commenter. Pero nanay nila ginawang miss Universe during campaign period tuwang-tuwa sila Let me end the post by sharing a very informative comment from a netizen regarding VP Sara Duterte's attire during PBBM's first SONA. That attire ensemble could well be a Pusaka, an heirloom embedded with spirituality, for the owner's family. That's the case for attires among the Kidapawan Monuvu (who share many cultural similarities with the Davao Tagabawa), we're curating an exhibit of Pusaka this August and among the items are heirloom clothes considered sacred by the tribe. But what is certain is that after Inday has worn this ensemble, the Tagabawa family which lent these clothes to her will forever consider them priceless Pusaka too. Mindanao has a rich indigenous tradition of sentimentality like that, and as you can see in these comments by Pinks, Filipino identity with its shallowness and coloniality will spit in the face of that tradition. Pusaka? Entertainment at cosplay lang yan sa Filipino Gaze. Pakialam ng Manila Republic sa kultura ng Mindanao e mga savage infideles lang naman tayo dito.- KAGD ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"TV host Bianca Gonzales' tweet, a known Leni Robredo supporter in the last presidential election, in reaction to PBBM's first SONA has elicited mixed reactions from netizens. Why? Because the TV host acknowledged that PBBM's SONA was good. She said she was hoping the Marcos admin delivers on the promises, for the country. If the Marcos admin succeeds, the country also succeeds. However, the TV host categorically stated she still wants the Marcoses to be accountable for the stolen wealth and ML human rights abuses. The part when the TV host said she wants the Marcoses to answer for the stolen wealth and ML human right abuses did not make a lot of Marcos supporters very happy and jumped in the comment section to express their feelings towards the TV host. One netizen asked if dragging the ""stolen wealth and human rights abuses"" is necessary. The netizen shared her theory that the TV host is simply playing safe to avoid earning the ire of Leni supporters. The heck, does she really have to insert"" stolen wealth and human rights abuses?"" Para hindi mabash ng todo ganun? She's playing safe now! A second netizen asked the TV host if she is in possession of evidence to back up her ""stolen"" allegation. A third said that the TV host's comment was ok but unfortunately, she can't hide her bitterness. OK na sana pero bitter parin mga iba nyang linyahan... ""STOLEN"" is such a BIG WORD. May ebidensya ka girl? Meanwhile, some netizens welcomed Bianca Gonzales' positive comment on PBBM's SONA despite being a Leni supporter. This netizen praised the TV host for doing the right thing. Ganyan move on para masaya ka sa buhay mo til the end Ms. Bianca you are doing the right thing haha sana all Another netizen could only hoped that all Kakampinks are like Bianca.

Pinoy Trending News,"Vice President and concurrent DepEd Secretary Sara Duterte Carpio announced that school uniforms is not mandatory in public schools to avoid incurring costs the families of learners. On Twitter, a certain Summer Santos has criticized VP and concurrent DepEd Secretary Sara Duterte Carpio's who declared that school uniforms are mandatory in public schools in the school year 2022-2023 because as Santos said, the Vice President does not know that wearing school uniforms equalizes all students. Nobody's self-esteem will be at risk if all public school students are in school uniforms. Santos lamented the wasted opportunity of making school uniforms mandatory and said the Vice President did not think about this very thoroughly when making the decision. Meanwhile on Facebook, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu had 10,000 or more netizens laughing at her reply post to Summer Santos' tweet. How? Chu spoke from the perspective of a mother telling her 5 children to make do with ""asin"" or salt to go with cooked rice because what matters most is they can buy self-esteem (school uniforms) especially how they have outgrown their school uniforms in the last 2 years. They will no longer fit to their self- esteem este school uniforms. In addition, the family will skip paying the electricity bill because they need to buy 2 pairs of self-esteem. This is to make sure that their self-esteem will not be destroyed. Chu turned serious and slammed the critics of the Vice President. She said Santos' argument just goes to show that Sara's critics are clueless of the reality in public schools in the provinces or in small barangays. She said public schools in the provinces are not some kind of private schools where school children are competing for the bragging the rights who owns the most expensive gadgets hence requiring school uniforms is mandatory. In the provinces, all of them are children of poor parents. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post below. ""Mga anak, pasensya na, magdildil muna tayo ng asin ngayon. Importante kasi kayong 5 na magkakapatid na nag aaral sa public school mabili natin yung self esteem nyo kasi ang laki ng linaki nyo nitong nakaraang 2 taon. Hindi na kayo kasya sa dati niyong self esteem. Wala din munang bayad sa kuryente kasi kailangan ninyo ng tig dadalawang self esteem. Siguraduhin ninyo di masira yang self esteem nyo ha. Kasi baka di na kayo makapasok sa eskwelahan pag Wala kayong self esteem."" KALOKA ANG MGA CRITICS NI SARA NO? HALATANG WALANG ALAM SA MGA PUBLIC SCHOOLS SA PROBINSIYA O SA MALILIIT NA BARANGAY. HOY MGA TEH HINDI ITO PRIVATE SCHOOL NA NAG IINGGITAN ANG MGA BATA NG MAMAHALING GAMIT KAYA KAILANGAN NG UNIFORM. SA PROBINSYA LAHAT SILA PARE PAREHONG ANAK MARALITA Chu's last sentence in the last paragraph that in the province, all children are poor elicited negative reactions from some netizens. Chu was forced to jump in the comment section to explain further and make the last line in the FB post clearer to those who did not get her point. Hindi ko sinabi na Pag taga probinsya automatic maralita. Kasi taga probinsya ako. Sabi ko Pag nasa probinsya ka at sa barangay public schools ka nag aaral, maralita ka. Kasi if May kaya ka your parents will send you to the nearest good private school. Kahit May kaya lang ha, kasi mura lang naman ang private sa probinsya. Hindi rich kid, May kaya kid. Di din ako naniniwala na lahat ng ofw sa private schools ang anak, or Hindi sila naghihirap Pag ofw. Yung mga mayayaman na ofw like mga big time engineers sa oil rig, they do send their kids to private schools. Pero Pag mama mo kahit ofw hirap din sa abroad, hirap ka din mag pa aral dito sa Philippines sa private. Ang point, barangay public school kids and their parents have bigger things to worry about than uniforms. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"International Relations expert and SMNI News Statecraft host Ms. Sass Rogando Sasot found it ridiculous PBBM's critics is now picking on his grammar. In a Facebook post, Sasot can't help but share her personal observation while studying and teaching in Europe in response to grammar police among the anti-Marcoses. Because of this, it is not surprising to see student papers with very bad grammar getting a higher grade than student papers with perfect grammar. Sasot argued that grammar is neither a measure of intelligence nor a measure how one can generate ideas and apply what you learn. Hence, you will never fail a student paper because of grammar. But, you will fail if you write something like ""Ibigay mo ang CIA report kay Biden."" Sasot's FB post has been quite popular among her FB followers, generating 35,000 reactions, 2,800 comments and 1,700 shares in just 16 hours and counting. You may now read Sass Rogando Sasot's original FB post. Juiceko grammar naman ni BBM pinupuna. Kids let me tell you this. The only and final assessment in the university where I studied and taught in Europe was always a final paper. Language is only 10% of the grade. And grammar was only one of the criteria in that percentage. That's why you could see student papers with very bad grammar yet get a higher grade than other student papers with perfect grammar. Reason: Grammar is NOT a measure of intelligence nor it is a measure of how you can generate ideas and integrate what you had learned. So you will never fail a paper because of grammar, but you will fail it if you write something like ""Ibibigay mo ang CIA report Kay Biden."" Here's what I found in the internet from PBBM critics.

Pinoy Trending News,"In the midst of the raging debate online sparked by the contrasting opinion of UP Economics Assistant Professor JC Pungongbayan and Former Agriculture Secretary Manny Pinol whether the Philippines is an agricultural country or not, neophyte Senator Robin Padilla cannot resist the urge to appoint himself as the referee. Basically, Senator Robin Padilla said that both gentleman have valid points and should be given equal emphasis by the public and the leaders of the country. The senator said what is happening to our agriculture is a wake up call for Filipinos. The neophyte senator remarked that the government's goal (NFA) is not to make a profit from agriculture but to feed its people rather than import from other countries. Of course the farmers need to make a profit to earn a living, if I may add. Senator Padilla said the world trade today is in a precarious situation because of conflict or war. (Russia- Ukraine War) Senator Padilla said that the country should not wait for the day when we can no longer find a country willing to sell us food (rice, wheat) import from. In other words, we are no longer talking about what economy but the country's survival. However, Senator Padilla strongly believe that the country is on a right track under the administration of PBBM. He urged Filipinos to support our farmers and fishermen and build a new generation.

Pinoy Trending News,"Ateneo de Manila alumnus, historian, author and independent curator Ambeth Ocampo, yes the historian who chided Ella Cruz on social media for her 'history is like chismis' remark is now butt of jokes among pro-Duterte and Marcos supporters. An old tweet of historian Ambeth Ocampo making positive affirmation of Leni repeating history in the 2022 presidential election has been making the rounds on Facebook lately. In the same tweet, Ocampo declared that Historians (are) for Leni. Ocampo's old tweet of positive affirmation of Leni repeating history would have been forgotten had he simply ignored Ella Cruz's remark and simply zipped his mouth. But that is water under the bridge now. As a consequence for his action, anti-Dilawan vloggers like the Luminous and Sass Rogando Sasot resurrected his old tweet where his bias against the Marcos and for Leni was in full display. Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous described Ambeth Ocampo's tweet a case of foot in mouth disease. International Relations expert Ms. Sass Rogando Sasot poked fun at Ambeth Ocampo's tweet of positive affirmation of Leni repeating history in 2022. Leni did repeat history, Sasot wrote. She got almost the same number of votes in 2022 election but not the same result as in 2016. History indeed repeated itself: Mamshie got almost the same number of votes. Sasot's ribbing of Ocampo elicited laughter among her FB followers, generating 7,000+ laugh emojis out of 8,411 reactions. Netizens shared their take on Ambeth Ocampo's old tweet of affirmation of Leni repeating history. One netizen said it best that Pinoys are smarter than the likes of Ambeth Ocampo give us credit for. We learn from not repeat history. The Filipino people are smarter than people give us credit for, hence, we now LEARN from history rather than repeat it. As such, we have the 2022 election results. A second netizen took a swipe at Ocampo's tweet. 2022 elections was a correction of history. A third perfectly described Ambeth Ocampo as a historian. Ambeth predicts history.

Asked why? Because according to Jamora, you cannot find the Philippines in the 2022 list of countries with the highest default risk despite its 63.5% Debt-to-GDP ratio. Jamora went on to explain that when looking at Debt-to-GDP ratio, you also take into consideration the countries economic indicators like GDP growth and what not in order to get the full picture.

Pinoy Trending News,"On Rappler's Maria Ressa saying Filipinos will lose far more than she does if she goes to jail, British vlogger and Pinoy-at-heart Malcolm Conlan cannot resist the itch to respond to what he called Ressa's worn out rhetoric she is a victim of persecution by a government that hates opposing views. Conlan conceded that the offence of cyber libel should not lead to imprisonment because when it falls in the wrong hands, it could lead to unfair conviction. However, in Maria Ressa's cyber libel conviction, Conlan is convinced that Maria Ressa was at fault because while they are busy fact checking others, it seems that their own fact checking mechanism failed to actually fact check their original article before publication. Ouch! Conlan quipped that if Maria Ressa goes to prison, Filipinos would not even be bothered or loose sleep over her fate. Conlan said he disagreed wit Maria Ressa's pet line the her conviction is an affront to democracy. In fact, Conlan said Maria Ressa's conviction is solid proof that justice and democracy in the Philippines are fully functioning. You may now read Malcolm Conlan's original open letter below. Ma'am Maria Ressa, I hate to intrude on your usual well worn rhetoric, but I have no doubt and can say 100% if you do eventually do jail time following your conviction for cyber libel, then that's just the wheels of Philippine justice turning well, as they should. Of course, it can be argued that the offence of Cyber libel should not lead to such a penalty as in the wrong hands it could lead to an unfair conviction. But in this case, when you make statements in public about anyone, you have to back that up. It's called 'Fact Checking! You and your team seem to be so busy fact checking others, but it seems that your own fact checking mechanism failed to actually fact check your original article before publication. To be honest, I don't think 31 million Filipinos or more would even be bothered or even loose any sleep over your fate, you seem to use the line that this conviction is a front to democracy or somehow 'weaponising the law' well I hate to disagree ma'am, but this case is actually 100% proof that justice and democracy is fully functioning in the Philippines. Of course you have the right of appeal etc and I do wish you luck with that, nobody wants to go to jail of course, but in this case, I don't believe you can keep harking on to the international community saying that you have been somehow wronged. If anything, you should understand that this is the law as if stands and anyone who falls short of it or breaks it awaits the same fate. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the Court of Appeals decision upholding the Maria Ressa and her writer for cyber libel, the popular mantra on social media among free speech advocates is ""defend press freedom"". Speaking of ""defend press freedom"", social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes can't help but make ""sumbat"" or upbraid the people who are crying press freedom now because of Maria Ressa by asking if Maria Ressa, Leni and all these free speech advocates called out the government in 1987 and 1992? If you're wondering why Reyes specifically mentioned these years, please check the screenshot photo below to get the answer to your question. Reyes also cited the case of Iloilo journalist and blogger Boy Mejorada and asked if they ran to his defense when he got convicted by libel with Senator Drilon as complainant? Reyes clarified she is in favor of decriminalizing libel and cyber libel even way back then. However, she confessed she cannot fully rejoice on Ressa's conviction even when Ressa bashed her and called her dork (socially inept person) is that she is consistent in her stand when it comes to free speech. But the same cannot be said of Ressa and company because they only cry foul when they are at the receiving end of the law. She said Ressa and company have this grave double standard! ""DEFEND FREE PRESS"" Did Maria Ressa, Leni, & all these so-called free speech advocates call out the gov't in 1987 & 1992? Did they come to Boy Mejorada's rescue when he got convicted of libel last year with no less than Sen. Drilon as complainant? I am for decriminalizing libel & cyber libel. Dati pa man. Reason why I cannot fully rejoice on Ressa's conviction even when this woman bashed me and called me dork (after cowardly blocking me on Twitter). Consistent ako sa stand ko when it comes to free speech. Habang sila, they'll only cry foul pag sila na ang na-convict. Ang tindi ng double standard! ",1

Sonza agreed with Ressa that she will surely go to jail because she was convicted by a competent court beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, the Court of Appeals also upheld her cyber libel conviction so going to jail is a certainty. That being said, Sonza told Maria Ressa the grim reality regarding the Filipino sentiment of her going to jail and that is? Filipinos don't give a damn or care if she rots in jail.

'Good morning fr Manila' means she is really soliciting sympathy from international audience.

You're using your nobel award as cushion of your dwindling credibility. It won't sell ressa. You can still go to the Supreme Court, but for the meantime serve your term at the jail. A third netizen wondered why Maria Ressa is attacking the government when it was a private citizen who filed a case against her. Private citizens ang kalaban ni Maria rehas at hindi ang gobyerno. Bakit hindi Yung nagdemanda Laban sa kanya ang atakehin niya. Inaasahan ba niya na pakikialaman ng gobyerno ang kaso niya Para hindi siya makulong? Saan ba siya galing? Of course the law is a weapon.

Pinoy Trending News,"So bakit parang kasalanan na naman ng Marcos Administration? This is the question posed by a certain Mark lan in reaction to Rappler's Maria Ressa tweet accusing PBBM and his administration has something to do with the Court of Appeals decision upholding her cybel libel conviction two years ago. [PNA] Mark lan argued that the Court of Appeals decision did not diminish the ability of journalists to hold power to account. He reminded Maria Ressa she was convicted of cyber libel. And speaking of cyber libel, Mark lan said Maria Ressa's conviction is a timely reminder to journalist to verify facts before posting anything. Mark lan figured that Maria Ressa's article against a private citizen must have been a huge lie and damaging to the plaintiff, enough for the court to uphold its decision. Mark lan told Maria Ressa to quit using the ""press freedom"" alibi. Freedom, he said, comes with responsibility. At this juncture, Mark lan asked Maria Ressa how is it the Marcos administration's fault when it private citizen who filed the cyber libel case against her? On allegation the Marcos admin harass and intimidate journalists? Mark lan can only laugh at the allegation of harassment when when the Marcos family has been at the receiving end of their black propaganda. Did the Marcos family even harass them by filing cases? No, Mark lan answered his own question. You may now read Mark lan's original FB post below. The decision did not weaken the ability of journalists to hold power to account.

Pinoy Trending News,"Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu and her FB followers are making a lot of noise on Facebook with a petition to PBBM asking to recall or replace the National Security Adviser Prof. Clarita Carlos because they have no-confidence of her leadership to lead the NTF-ELCAC which PRRD and his men have worked hard in the last few years with the sole mission - stamp out the NPA rebels and its legal fronts in Philippine society. Of course, Marcos loyalists are asking Chu and the DDS who shares her sentiment to give NSA Secretary Carlos the chance to prove her mettle before asking her head on the platter. Besides, at the time Chu was making a lot of noise on her FB page, NSA Secretary has yet to sit down with the AFP for her security briefings until yesterday noon. So it's really premature to judge her based on her past pronouncements that made Chu and company to ask for Prof. Carlos replacement when she has yet to get all the information she needs to help her decide what to do with NTF-ELCAC and the Duterte appointees. Based on her latest interview, she has nothing to do with the firing of people as alleged by Ms. Chu in her latest FB post because those co-terminus with the president are also expected to go unless they are retained by their agency heads by making a request. Here's the link of the interview of Sec. Clarita Carlos wherein she talked about sitting down with members of the NTF-ELCAC and getting briefed. Just jump straight to around 1:15:16 if you don't want to watch the 2- hour plus interview. The briefing of Sec. Carlos with AFP and NTF-ELCAC happened around noon on July 7, 2022. In the midst of the brouhaha over the NSA Secretary Carlos, Atty. Bruce Rivera wrote a timely article with the title 'RECONCILING PROF CLARITA CARLOS AND DR. LORRAINE BADOY POSITIONS'in an attempt to enlighten the supporters of both camps and that there is nothing to fight about because both women come from the same school of skinning a c@t. You may now read Atty. Bruce original FB post below and let us hear what you think by posting your comments on the page. I watched and listened to both arguments and in all honesty, I really do not see the conflict in both positions. Dr. Badoy is talking a practical standpoint. Indeed, there is recruitment in schools by the forces of the CPP NPA. But Prof Carlos is also correct in saying that no policy supporting it will ever exist in all our schools as a matter of principle. Here is the cause of confusion. DEMOCRACY. We are against the CPP NPA because they threaten our democratic institutions. And for good reason. But it is also our adherence to democratic precepts of free speech and expression and the right to education that enables recruitment by the CPP NPA because they can only shape minds if they are in a society that allows freedom of ideas. That is what I think Prof Clarita Carlos is getting her bearings. Dr. Lorraine Marie T. Badoy and the NTF ELCAC argues that the CPP NPA is allowed to fester in schools and that is very true. Which needs to be remedied by the state and government. But from a security standpoint, we cannot prevent the flow of ideology by preventing it to flow. Because at some point, it is like a dam waiting to burst its banks when heavy rains are here. If we curtail ideology by preventing it to flow, will just encourage the morbid curiosity of free thinkers who thrives best in an environment they are not allowed to think. So, my position is clear. Badoy and Carlos come from the same school of killing the cat. But there are so many ways of punishing your pussy and killing a destructive cat. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On PBBM casting doubt on PH inflation figures from PSA, Makabayan Bloc lawmaker Arlene Brosas commented that Filipinos are now eating ""pagpag"" or leftover foods. So basically, the Leftist lawmaker said PBBM is wrong or simply clueless of what is happening under this administration. In that regard, Marcos loyalist/vlogger/certified public accountant Edwin Jamora rejected Rep. Arlene Brosas that the country is eating pagpag or leftovers to fight hunger. In a Facebook post, Jamora asked his followers who would believe Filipinos are now eating pagpag? He said he just came from Bicol. Even visited Ilocos. He did not see our fellow Filipinos eating pagpag as claimed by Brosas. What he saw are Pinoys who are social. Jamora ended the brief FB post by mentioning Brosas' barong which he found nice while calling her Miss Pagpag! You may now read Edwin Jamora's rebuttal to Arlene Brosas' quip versus PBBM. Sino naman maniniwala sayo na pagpag na kinakain ng mga kababayan natin? Galing ako Bicol. Punta pa Ilocos. Hindi pagpag nakikita kong kinakain ng mga kababayan natin. Sosyal mga nakikita ko. Pero, ha? Ang ganda naman ng Barong mo, Miss Pagpag! Tse! Netizens who are Edwin Jamora's FB followers quickly jumped in the comment section to share their sentiment on Arlene Brosas' statement Pinoys are now eating pagpag or leftover food. One netizen commented that perhaps it's Arlene Brosas who is now resorting to eating pagpag but not us. Ikaw lang kumakain ng pagpag hindi kami. A second netizen replied that they just finished their meal consisting of Andok's roast beef and definitely accompanied with cooked rice. Kakakain lang namin ng Andok's lechon baka. Tse! A third netizen slammed Brosas for her fondness of peddling fake news. Ang hilig magkwento ng chismis tapos sasabihin history. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Tricia Robredo's tweet criticizing the bill filed by a solon from Negros proposing to change the name of NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) to Ferdinand E. Marcos International Airport has drawn flak from fellow Bicolano Edwin Jamora. Jamora is US-based CPA (Certified Public Accountant) Marcos loyalist and vlogger. In a Facebook post, Jamora asked Tricia Robredo to please stop whatever she is doing on Twitter. He asked whether she is ignorant or what? He said during the Dilawan's time when Manila International Airport was changed to its current name. Jamora asked Tricia if she has any inkling how costly that change of name from MIA to NAIA? And now, she thinks she is playing the heroine with her rant? Why is she mad? Jamora ribbed Tricia by asking her what street at the airport her anger will be put down? Jamora ended the brief ""love"" letter to Tricia Robredo by telling her to stop testing the Marcos loyalists. Pwede vah Tricia Robredo! Are you ignorant or what?! Panahon ninyo when Manila International Airport was changed to NAIA! Do you know how costly that was for the country?! Tapos ngayon, akala mo hero ka with your chienes! So, bakit galit ka? Saang kanto ng Airport dapat ilagay ang galit mo?! Wag kami! Tse! Here are some of the reactions of netizens to Tricia Robredo's tweet. One netizen advised Tricia to stop meddling in politics because her mother is now citizen Leni. #TrishiaRobredo citizen Leni na lng nanay mo. Tigilan mo na pag epal Hindi Malacañang nag file ng Bill na yan. Si Cong. Teves i bash mo timang A second netizen echoed the sentiment of the above commenter. Manahimik ka kung makapag Salita ka akala MO Kung sino ka?! Pag talunan manahimik na ha.. A third informed Tricia that PBBM or Malacanang has nothing to do with the said bill. Hija, priority ni Teves 'yan. Hindi priority ni presidente 'yan. Isubmit ni Teves sa tongress 'yang panukala niya. Either na uusbong or not sa tongress. Manahimik ka na lang ha A fourth netizen was more brutal in explaining why Tricia Robredo is criticizing the proposed bill renaming NAIA to MIA. Feeling relevant yan mga pink Reaction? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, showbiz columnist/vlogger and certified Kakampink Ogie Diaz as per Global Daily Mirror's description, tweeted urging Mark Lopez to enumerate his achievements to see if he has done a lot for the country. Mr. Ogie Diaz tweet was in reaction to Lopez's Tribute column where the latter did a Richard Heydarian. In case you missed it, Richard Heydarian mocked President Duterte's foreign policy sometime in July 2019 by publishing a blank article on his Inquirer 'Horizons' column accusing the Duterte administration of having zero independent foreign policy. Of course, die hard Kakampinks like Ogie Diaz are losing their minds on Twitter because Mark Lopez's July 4 column with the title 'The performance of Leni Robredo' is a copycat of Richard Heydarian's Inquirer column. Can you imagine Lopez giving the Kakampinks a dose of their own medicine? I kennat! Lopez wasted no time in answering back to Ogie Diaz's tweet and asked if this is the same Ogie Diaz who is a rabid anti-government but was one of the firsts to fall in line to receive his covid vax by using comorbidity card to get inoculated? Lopez is apparently astonished that Ogie Diaz would asking his accomplishments like he is a public official? Lopez reckoned that perhaps Diaz is just used to Dilawan's style of enumerating their shallow achievements with matching praise este press release which is the expertise of the Kakampinks? You may now read mark Lopez's brief rebuttal to Ogie Diaz's tweet. Eto ba yung The Ogie Diaz na nukunukan ng nega sa gobyerno pero naunang pumila sa bakuna, na kunwari may commorbidity para ma inoculate kagad?

Pinoy Trending News,"Comedian and singer Janno Gibbs was quoted by news website Balita.net complaining about deadline for paying taxes. He said the poor are fine because they are not paying taxes. The wealthy are fine because he said, they have many ways. (He left the sentence hanging which can be interpreted in different ways, depending how imaginative your mind is.) The middle class are pitiful, they can't evade paying taxes. Good thing I have no job. Atty. Nick of the FB page Nick Nangit - NCN Law can't help but correct Janno Gibbs' assertion regarding PH taxes. In a Facebook post, Atty. Nick wrote the headline 'SPOTTED TANGA' to arouse the curiosity of netizen who stumbled upon his FB page. Atty. Nick wasted no time in exposing the inaccuracies of Janno Gibbs' statement regarding taxes. First and foremost, Atty. Nick asked Janno Gibbs what tax he was talking about when we are just starting the month. If he was talking about withholding tax, he has nothing to worry about since he is just the recipient and the payor with withhold the tax. Second, Janno Gibbs was correct to say that the poor are not paying taxes unless they are earning more than 250K a year. Thanks to the TRAIN Law of President Duterte. If he was alluding to PBBM, Atty. Nick said the Supreme Court has already junked the petition regarding tax evader allegation. Atty. Nick urged Janno Gibbs to read. Third, Atty. Nick slammed Janno Gibbs for insinuating that the rich don't pay taxes or correct taxes because they have different ways how to evade paying? Atty. Nick told Janno Gibbs that corporations and individual taxpayers are taxed differently so what hell was he talking about the rich have ""paraan"" or ways to evade paying tax? Atty. Nick went on for a few more paragraphs debunking Janno Gibbs's double meaning statement regarding paying taxes. You may now read Atty. Nick's original FB post below. 1. Anong tax yan e simula pa lang ng buwan? Kung withholding tax yan, e recipient ka lang, so ang payor ang mag wi-withhold ng tax. Bakit mo poproblemahin? Maka mema ka, wagas! 2. Tamo, wala talagang babayaran ang mahihirap kung hindi sila kumikita ng lalagpas sa 250k sa isang taon. Pasalamatan mo si #PRRD, dahil ginawa niyang urgent ang TRAIN Law, kaya ipinasa agad ng Kongreso. At kung itinutumbok mo naman si #BBM, ibinasura na ng Korte Suprema ang mga petisyon na ume eme emeng tax evader siya. Magbasa ka! 3. Pero, wait, ang binubuwisan ay kita, hindi dahil mahirap o mayaman. Kung walang kinikita, mahirap o mayaman man, e di walang buwis. Malay mo kung palamunin lang sila sa loob ng isang taon?! Stew feed na bansot! 4. Ang mayayaman nagbabayad din ng buwis. So, anong may paraan? Iba ang mga korporasyon sa mga indibidwal na nagbabayad ng buwis. At hindi yan dahil mayaman o mahirap sila! Saang multiverse mo natutunan yan? Btw, kahit bansot, may bidyo ka nga pala?! Dakilang iskandalosa! 5. Lahat binubuwisan, basta't may kita. Ke purita, middle class, o mayaman, obligasyon yan sa Estado! Lahat ng Estado sa buong mundo ay naniningil ng buwis. Paano mabubuhay ang pamahalaan kung walang buwis? Ganun din sa pamilya! Paano mabubuhay ang pamilya kung walang kita ang nagtataguyod nito? Despwes, kmusta na kayo ni Bing? 6. Kahit wala kang trabaho, nagbabayad ka pa rin ng buwis! Ungas nato! Kumakain ka, bumibili ng basic needs sa supermarket, at tumatawag sa telepono. Sa tingin mo, walang buwis na ipinapasa sa iyo ang mga suppliers at providers?

Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, Senator Chiz Escudero tweeted expressing doubt whether President BBM can veto a bill passed by the ""previous"" Congress when he was not yet President. If he can sign it (because the signatories will be composed of present/past officials that didn't serve at the same time) can he veto it? It's unique legal quandary, Escudero wrote. In that regard, Atty. Bruce Rivera can't help but make a comment on Senator Escudero's tweet that as a lawyer himself, there must no uncertainty on his part. Atty. Rivera asked his readers how to interpret the Constitution? Isn't it in favor of the discharge of functions of the office that is self-executing and mandatory if not provided otherwise explicitly. In theory, Atty. Rivera argued, that PBBM is an extension of PRRD because that is the intent. Continuity is the rule of the thumb. Meanwhile, Atty. Rivera remarked that Senator Escudero's argument looks very stupid. The former Congress can submit a law but it is not okay for the incumbent President to veto it. He called this argument preposterous if not illogical. Atty. Bruce conceded that Sen. Escudero is posing a legal query but the every repugnant question is, why the last minute effort to sneak in the bill? Is it life and death that it cannot wait? Atty. Bruce ended the FB post saying that the crocs have just revealed their interest. You may now read Atty. Bruce original FB post below. NAKU HA??? Abogado si Sen. Chiz so dapat walang uncertainty. Paano ba ang interpretation sa Constitution, di ba in favor of the discharge of functions of the office na self-executing and mandatory if not provided otherwise explicitly. PBBM is in theory, an extension of PRD kasi yan naman ang intent. Continuity is the general rule. Second, di ba tanga lang. Pwede magsubmit ng law ang dating Congress pero di pwede i veto ng kasalukuyang Pangulo. That is preposterous if not illogical. It may be a legal query but ang mas nakakarimarim na tanong, bakit hinabol ng last minute? Life and death ba na di makahintay. Ayan, napaghahalata ang interes ng mga buwaya. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, historian Ambeth Ocampo chided young actress Ella Cruz for comparing ""history"" to chismis (gossip) because it is filtered and even exaggerated as a result, the public is denied of real history. The idea is there but it can be denied, there is bias, Cruz said. Ambeth Ocampo, a Filipino historian as per PhilStar's own words didn't like Ella Cruz's opinion and as I've said, chided the young actress, one of the casts of Viva Films 'Maid in Malacanang' of director Darryl Yap. Don't confuse history with chismis. History may have bias but it is based on facts not opinion. Real History is about TRUTH, not lies, not fiction, Ambeth Ocampo wrote. Enter Atty. Nick of the FB page Nick Nangit - NCN Law. Atty. Nick minces no words in calling Ambeth Ocampo ""ambitious"" person, someone who likes to lift his own chair, who just answered back but his arguments were erroneous. Why? Because he is one of the guardians of the Dilawan, that's why! Basically, Atty. Nick 4 arguments to back up his assertion that Ambeth Ocampo's statement are full of holes or errors. Let me just focus on the first of 4 parts. Atty. Nick defended Ella from the get go, saying she was simply using a figure a of speech when she compared history to chismis or gossiping. Atty. Nick slammed Ambeth Ocampo for telling Ella not to confuse history with chismis when it appears he is the one looking confused, not Ella. Atty. Nick explained by citing an example. Like, when someone says he is like Roderick Paulate, it does not mean he is Roderick Paulate. He just looks like Roderick Paulate, just a resemblance. So when some is looking for you and said you look like Roderick Paulate, for sure, the person being asked will point to your direction. After proving his argument that Ambeth Ocampo's statements are erroneous, Atty. Nick proceeded to Lecture Ambeth Ocampo that writing history is not without bias, especially so when no one really knew the entire story and the the historian writing history lacks necessary data, hence he will just form his own opinion. Besides, history is always written by the victors. It would be unthinkable that the victor will paint the loser as a hero. Atty. Nick ended the long FB rant by challenging Ambeth Ocampo to know the real story behind Ninoy and PNoy Aquino's death so that he will have some use for the 31 million voters of PBBM. YELLOW HISTORIAN Etong Ambethyoso nato, na mahilig mag angat ng sariling bangko, hihirit lang mali mali pa! Bakit? E dahil isa sya sa mga tagabantay ng mga dilawang poootah! 1. Ang sabi ni Ella ""LIKE"". Hindi nya sinabing ""History IS chismis"". Ang tawag diyan ay ""simile"". Isa siyang ""figure of speech"". Kinukumpara lang niya ang kasaysayan sa tsismisan. Bakit may pa-confuse ka pang nalalaman e mukhang ikaw ang na-confuse! Parang ganito lang yan: Kung sasabihin ko, Ambethoso is LIKE Roderick Paulate, hindi ibig sabihin ikaw siya. Kamukha mo lang o yun bang may similarities kayo. Kapag may naghahanap sa inyo at dinescribe si Roderick Paulate na kamukha nung dambuhalang pakalat kalat, malamang ituturo ka, getz mo? 2. Totoo naman ang sinabi ni Ella. Habang may buhay tayong lahat, may kanya-kanyang opinyon ang bawa't isa. Dapat igalang ang pananaw. Wala naman siyang sinasabi na tumataliwas sa mga eme eme mo. Bakit ka affected? Dahil lamang kasama siya sa pelikula? Dahil lamang may pelikulang maglalahad na ng kabilang bahagi ng mga kuwentong dilaw? Ayaw niyo bang malaman ang buong kwento? Para lang yan sa away ng mag-asawa. Hindi isang panig lang ang pakikinggan. Dapat parehong panig ay pakinggan. Doon malalaman ang buong kwento. Ang mahirap sa inyong mga hinehepa, Ambethyoso, e gusto nyo isang panig lang ang ikalat at ituro. Mali yun. Kahit sa korte o sa kumpisal, pakikinggan ang dapat pakinggan. 3. Ansave mo, Ambethyso? ""History may have bias, but it is... not opinion""? Pag bias, ibig sabihin may kinikilingan. Yan pa lamang pagkiling na yan ay pagpili na ng pinaniniwalaan, kaya't lilitaw ang opinyon, dahil nga kinakailangang tumugma ang pagkiling sa paniniwala. 4. Lahat ng naisulat na kasaysayan ay may kinikilingan. Halimbawa, sa paggamit pa lamang ng pang-uri, kapag may namatay sa isang monarkiya, depende sa manunulat kung gagamitin niya ang salitang ""pinatay"" o ""napatay"". Kung gusto niya ang pumatay, sasabihin niya, ""napatay sa digmaan ang hari"". Kung ayaw naman niya sa pumatay, sasabihin niya, ""pinatay ang hari"". Magkaiba ang mabubuo sa kaisipan ng magbabasa. Sa una, ikatutuwa ng magbabasa ang kamatayan, dahil matapang at pinaglaban nang nagwagi, kaya napatay ang hari. Sa ikalawa, ikagagalit ng magbabasa ang kamatayan, dahil may masamang ginawa sa hari. Ano ang ibig sabihin nito? Na ang pagsusulat ng kasaysayan ay laging may kinikilingan, lalo pa't kung walang nakaaalam ng buong nangyari o kung kulang ang datos, kaya bubuo na lamang ng opinyon. At saka, ang kasaysayan ay laging isinusulat ng nagwagi sa tunggalian. Alangan namang isulat ng nanalo na magaling at hangaan ang natalo. Walang permanente sa mundo. Maging ang kasaysayan ay hindi permanente. Pag may naungkat na bagong datos, kinakailangang baguhin, dagdagan, o iwasto ang kasaysayan. Halimbawa, kung nakasulat sa kasaysayan na walang anak ang isang reyna, subali't lumabas kalaunan, lumantad, at sinuri pa na mayroon nga, itatanggi mo pa ba na, base sa mga naunang datos e, wala pa ring anak? Huwag kang tanga, Ambithyoso! Lalo mo pang guguluhin ang usapin, dahil pinapasok mo ang fiction. Iba ang kasaysayan sa opinyon, at pareho silang iba sa kathang-isip. Umayos ka, Ambithyoso! HINDI ka lang ang awtoridad sa usapin ng kasaysayan! Maraming awtoridad. At hindi lahat kayo ay pare-pareho ang opinyon. At lagi nga kayong nagtatalu-talo. Kung ang mga mismong saksi sa isang pangyayari ay nagtatalu-talo, yun pa kayang mga wala doon at ibabalita na lang?! Mahilig ka lang magsaliksik. Period. Pwes, alamin mo kung sino ba pumatay kay Ninoy at kung bakit kinremate si Noynoy, para may silbi ka sa 31M! At saka, laging tandaan, umasta nang naaayon sa ganda, chura neto!!! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"I don't know if former Vice President Leni Robredo is just being competitive but a day after President Bongbong Marcos was officially inaugurated as the country's 17th President, she just launched her Angat Buhay NGO. Many Duterte and Marcos supporters can't help but question the motives of Leni Robredo's NGO and think she is doing this to stay politically relevant until the next election and run again for President. Staunch Duterte supporter and Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu perfectly captured the sentiment of the Duterte and Marcos supporters in her latest Facebook post. Chu said the only way Leni Robredo's NGO will change her perception that it is for her political plans in the future is when she and her followers will work quietly in the background, sans the fanfare and stop making it appear they are better than the government like what she did to the Duterte government. Chu cited UNICEF and Tzu Chi as prime examples of NGOs who help the people without fanfare just like what they did in Yolanda-ravaged communities in the Visayas. Until then, she will not stop thinking Leni Robredo's NGO is not really to help but to keep her in the news and in the minds of the public until the next election. You may now read Ms. Chu's original FB post below. Paano daw ba malalaman na totoong NGO Yung kay Leni Robredo dahil mabuti ang puso nya, at gusto nya tumulong, and not to keep her politically relevant in the next few years so she can be made to run again? Ganito: When she helps and does not compete with the government. When she helps and her followers won't say, ""Nauna pa kami kay Marcos,"" the way she did with Duterte. When her followers help without making it appear that they're better people than Marcos supporters. When they help quietly and without fanfare. There are MANY NGOs in the Philippines and many helped during the Duterte admin-but not ONE made it appear that they were competing with Duterte. Only Leni Robredo and her followers and supporters would help and then make everything a competition. When UNICEF comes, they help without fanfare. They also have donors they need to be accountable to, but they can make a report internally. Tell me honestly, is there any one NGO (as in NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION) that blasts the government if it were first on the ground instead of government, or that competes with the government? Tzu Chi almost single-handedly and consistently saved Leyte post Yolanda and not one peep from them about the massive f*ckup of Aquino administration. So if Leni Robredo and her followers can be quiet and dignified in their mission to help in the next few years, then I will admit that I am wrong in thinking that this NGO is nothing but a ploy to make her politically relevant. That this isn't a way to continually undermine the current government as they did the Duterte government. That this isn't a way to show off what Leni can do to prepare her in 2028 against Sara. I want to know that an NGO (a group that exists because it isn't and shouldn't be connected to government) will not be used as a tool in a long game being played by Liberal Party acolytes to rebuild their decimated party. Marunong naman ako tumanggap na mali ako-but I am confident na hindi. Makikita natin yan sa next 6 years. Sana nga kahit one time wala akong marinig na yabang o kwenta. Sana mali ako. Sana tama kayo.

Pinoy Trending News,"Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza slammed 'mainstream media' for acting like our neighborhood Marites rather than the watchdog of Philippine democracy by dedicating a contemptuous news article on President Bongbong Marcos expensive wristwatch instead of writing about the observance of protocols and traditions of a presidential inauguration etc.. Sonza was furious 'mainstream media' has made a fuss of President Marcos Patek Philippe wristwatch when everybody knows he already owned a luxury watch in his bachelor days. Besides, his family and wife's family belong to the alta sociedad so owning one is no big deal to them. Sonza stated that to the rich and successful people, wearing expensive watches like Patek in important occasions is a standard part of men's wardrobe. Sonza added that who's who in the Philippines who attended the June 30 inauguration wore a luxury wrist watch like this. Sonza ended the FB post claiming that he know a farmer who wears a Patek wristwatch when he attends the Sunday mass. You may read Jay Sonza's original FB post below. WATCHDOG O INGGIT NA MARITES LANG ANG PEG. Here's a typical reaction of the ""wokes"" of Imperial Manila. Instead of writing about the observance of protocols and traditions of a presidential inauguration; the valedictory address of the incoming president; and the directions spelled in the first nationwide address, this ""mainstream media"" chose to write with contempt, the wrist watch of the duly elected chief executive of the nation. Ginagawang napakalaking bagay na nagmamay-ari ng Patek Phillipe si Mr. Marcos, gayong alam naman ng lahat na binata pa lang si Bongbong ay nagsusuot na ito ng dekalidad na relo. Bukod dito, ang pamilya niya at pamilya ng kanyang maybahay ay galing sa buena familia at alta sociedad at maliit na bagay sa kanila ang pagkakaroon ng ganitong piyesa. Sa aming mga nakakaintindi, nagsikap at nakapag-ipon, ang pagsusuot ng Patek o kahalintulad na relo sa mga mahahalagang pagtitipon ay standard part of wardrobe o must wear for the occasion. Katunayan, halos lahat ng mga may sinasabi sa lipunan na dumalo sa magkakasunod na pagtitipon noong June 30 ay nakasuot ng ganitong uri ng mga kagamitan. Mayroon nga akong kilalang magsasaka na nagsusuot nito tuwing may okasyon na puputanhan tulad ng pagsisimba tuwing linggo. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"As expected, Marcos critics like journalist Raissa Robles claimed on Twitter that President Bongbong Marcos was reading his inaugural speech with the little help from a teleprompter. Robles must have arrived with that conclusion because she agreed with the observation of netizens that President Marcos delivered his speech perfectly and eloquently.

Read the original FB post of Coach Jarret to check how he debunk Raissa Robles' claim PBBM was reading his speech via a prompter. Raissa Robles. You know how prompters work pero maraming hindi.

Burden of proof is on you Raissa Robles. It is journos like you who leave a bad taste in the mouth of Filipinos. Netizen followers of Coach Jarret jumped into the comment section to express their opinion on the issue.

Pinoy Trending News,"The First Lady Lisa Araneta Marcos has been criticized by Dilawans on Twitter, led by journalist and blogger Raissa Robles, who shared the screenshot of the photo of the FL sticking her tongue out in public. Robles said that the FL did the ""tongue"" thingy at the Filipino nation just before her husband delivers a speech stressing UNITY. Robles ended the tweet with the #Belat and #ActionSpeak Louder Than Words which is not surprising because that's what critics do - paint the First Family in a bad light in the eyes of the public. As expected, the Marcos supporters are there to defend the First Family as soon as the critics fired the shots. Former ABS-CBN reporter and now editor of AutoCar Philippines ran to the defense of First Lady Lisa Araneta Marcos on Facebook. Here's the explanation of Mr. Ira Panganiban why FL Lisa did the ""belat"" gesture that the Marcos critics made a huge fuss on Twitter. Excuse me, the First Lady was caught on camera teary eyed. This picture was caught right after she wiped her eyes. It was her way of making fun of her emotion during the inauguration. Taenang malisyosong mga palaka. Panganiban's explanation was well received by his FB followers alike as shown in the comments below. One netizen commented that she did not find this offensive. In fact, she find it adorable.

Kesa sobrang pabebe at prim and proper palagi kala mo members ng royal family. A third said he did not find anything wrong with the ""belat"" gesture from the First Lady but just a natural reaction from someone who is happy.

Pinoy Trending News,"The statements of incoming National Security Adviser Prof. Clarita Carlos denying the existence of NPA recruitment inside UP has been found to be discomforting by some of PRRD's staunch supporters, including Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu. Chu's uneasiness with Prof. Clarita Carlos appointment as the head of the Philippine version of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), the NSA is very palpable in the open letter she addressed to President-elect Bongbong Marcos. Chu admitted that Prof. Carlos is an asset to the Marcos administration but not as the head but in any security-related government post like the National Security because she is very ill equipped if she doesn't believe in the years of intelligence reports gathered by your very own armed forces. In addition, the NSA is life and death and should be given to those who have already proven their worth in their decades-long fight against armed rebels. As of this writing. Chu's open letter is going viral, generating 14,000+ reactions, 1,500 comments and 700+ shares in just 3 hours and counting. You may now read Ms. Krizette Chu's open letter to President-elect Marcos below. Dear President-elect Marcos, I would like to respectfully request for you to replace Professor Clarita Carlos as NSA head with someone who believes in NPA recruitment in schools, in calling out communists, and in the sovereignty of our courts and our people. The NSA is our CIA. And she is very ill equipped if she doesn't believe in the years of intelligence reports gathered by your very own armed forces. There are returning rebels your government has to protect. Government officials risked their lives so they can fight the NPA. It is your government's duty to protect everyone who fight against the NPA. We don't have the luxury of time to ""test"" or ""wait"" or ""see first"" if Prof Clarita Carlos can do well in her job. We cannot ignore the red flags. It won't be good for this government if the NPA is given time to regroup and goes after the returnee rebels. It will be on you, President elect Marcos, if they are targeted, and not on Prof Clarita. This is not to say that Prof Clarita will not be an advantage to your government. She will be, but not in any security-related position. She is brilliant and articulate and passionate, but the NSA is life and death and should be given to those who have already proven their worth in their decades-long fight against armed rebels. Now is not the time to take chances or bet on people who have never had experience with this. We need the momentum of the previous NTF ELCAC, and will bank on your promised continuity that one of the most important projects of the PRRD administration will not be abandoned or misdirected by well- meaning but ill-matched people. Respectfully, Me ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A political writer using the Facebook name Jose Alejandrino expressed doubts regarding incoming National Adviser Prof. Clarita Carlos competence for the national security job after she was quoted saying forming group of scholars to craft national security strategy under the PBBM presidency. [Link here] Alejandrino preferred our defense and security officials to do the job regarding our national security strategy, not scholars. Why? Alejandrino is worried about leakages of state secrets only reserved for the President's eyes because for sure scholars will be asking confidential intel if and when they are going to craft our national security strategy. Alejandrino wondered if Carlos wants the enemy to know what are classified as secret matters? Alejandrino is only agreeable to Carlos suggestion if scholars have A1 security clearance. If there are leakages of sensitive intel, the NSA will become the biggest national security risk to the country. Alejandrino ended the article expressing respect for Prof. Carlos intellect but the idea of scholars crafting our national security strategy is the most stupid idea he has heard. You may now read Jose Alejandrino's FB post below. DOES CARLOS KNOW WHAT SHE IS DOING? NSA-designate Carlita Carlos wants scholars to craft a national security strategy. Why scholars and not our defense/security officials? Next the scholars will be asking for confidential Intel only reserved for the president's eyes. Does Carlos want the enemy to know what are classified as secret matters? Leakages are always possible. No scholar must have access to highly confidential matters without Al security clearance. If God forbid there are leakages of sensitive info, the NSA will become the biggest national security risk to our country. I respect Carlita Carlos for her intellect but this is the most stupid idea I have heard. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Dilawan influencer Francis Baraan IV was shitting on the #SalamatPRRD on Twitter after Quirino Grandstand event trended by asking the Duterte supporters for what reasons we are thankful to PRRD? For the EJKs, for normalizing misogyny, for jailing dissenters? For the lies and fake news? Without Leni, it would have been unbearable 6 years. Hence, we should be thankful to Leni Robredo not Duterte, Baraan tweeted. Baraan's viral tweet did not fail to atrract the attention of pro-Duterte social media influencer of the Manila Bulletin Krizette Laureta Chu who retaliated with her own wicked response to Baraan's swipe at PRRD on Twitter. Chu replied that the only reason the DDS are thanking PRRD is that he did not shit on his bed in Malacanang in the last 6 years. Meanwhile, there are those who shit on their bed even if they slept on it for one night. She clarified though that her swipe that PRRD did not shit on his Malacanang bed but somebody did is not politics-related. The only reason nagpapasalamat kami kay PRRD is di sya nag iwan ng tae sa kama nya sa Malacanang for the entire 6 years. Yung Iba one night only pero nag iiwan ng tae sa kama. Yun lang, not politics-related. Baraan wasted no time in replying to Krizette's FB post and commented on the thread: Krizzy, you crack me up. For someone who is supposed to be a bonafide journalist, you seem to have a proclivity for parroting the fake news started by actual fake news peddlers. LOL. Hilarious! Chu replied to Baraan's comment and denied she was peddling fake news about PRRD not shitting all over his bed. She also chided Baraan for telling her what to do while accusing Baraan of just being jealous. She turned the table around and dared Baraan to organize Salamat Leni and use his own money. Francis Baraan IV what's fake news here, franky? I'm just saying we're just happy he didn't sh*t all over his bed. By the way, Bakit ka pala nakiki alam sa effort ko sa Salamat PRRD? Bakit Hindi ka nalang gumawa ng Salamat Leni? Bakit ""dapat pasalamatan si Leni""? Who are you to tell me who to thank? If I want to thank him and not Leni, what's it to you? Is this government funded? Can you prove that the government spent for the event? Your dad made more money than my dad-I'm very sure of it-so why not spend your own money to thank who you want to thank instead of asking why we think Duterte deserves to be thanked. Sino ka naman para maging accountable kami sayo? For someone who's supposedly educated, you're ignorant. And inggitero. Your parents didn't raise you well. Maybe they were busy with other things.

This is the reaction of International Relations expert and SMNI News Statecraft host Sass Rogando Sasot to the tweet of journalist and blogger Raissa Robles who made fun of the outfit of First Lady Atty. Liza Araneta Marcos she wore during the oathtaking of VP Sara Duterte in Davao City on Twitter. In case you are at a loss why Ms. Sasot remarked that perhaps Raissa Robles found the word ""security"" funny, just read the comments in Sasot's thread because one of them commented about it and voila, you will have your answer! Anyhow, Raissa Robles' tweet did not make a lot Marcos supporters very happy and retaliated by making negative remarks against the Dilawan journalist and blogger. One netizen shared one's observation that people who are very ugly are number 1 in insulting other people. Pansin ko lang yung mga pinaka pangit ang mga pinaka mapanglait. A second echoed the sentiment of the above commenter. Ung magaling manlait pro mas kalait lait ang itsura you made my night sing dilim ng kulay mo madam raissa A third warned Raissa to expect a blowback for insulting ordinary working class Filipinos. Another mockery of the ordinary working class. Wait for the bounce back A fourth remarked that while Raissa Robles and fellow Dilawans think they were making fun Liza Marcos, they were actually making fun of the regular labor force. They think they are making fun of Lisa, what they really are doing is showing their contempt for the regular labor force. What's wrong with working as security? It's an honest job not like the convicted felon who has no integrity and who lies to the world stage ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu isn't a super fan of President-elect BBM. In fact, she only voted for him in the last election because she does not want Leni Robredo to become PRRD's successor. But when the President-elect's appointees appear to be throwing the new President under the bus by not exercising circumspect in their statements to the press, she can't help but call out the new appointees on Facebook to let them know they are doing a disservice to their Boss. You may now read Ms. Chu's FB post to understand what I am trying to say. ""Puwede ba maging role model kayo? The Marcoses will now pay their taxes, because nag-comply sa batas, it came from the Supreme Court, it's final and executory.' 'Yun lang naman ang sasabihin ko sa kanya, pero I should have the correct data. I should know what really is in that decision."" My wish is that incoming government heads like BIR chief Lilia Guillermo (and Prof Clarita Carlos) will be more circumspect in their statements to the press just in case it seems like they're throwing the new President under the bus. You can just say, ""I cannot comment until I have reviewed all the details of the case,"" instead of ""Pwede ba maging role model kayo."" Because that may come off-or be twisted by critics as-inferring that he isn't. I personally believe that as a government employee, you don't have to like the President you work for (not that I'm saying she doesn't ha, just a matter of example), because it's the country you are serving, not him. But for the sake of a united front, and a country that's solid, you accord respect to the President. You can't destabilize from within. If you can't stomach the system that's when you leave. When you work for government dapat super duper tactful ka kasi everything you say reflects on the government you work for. ",1

Parlade said this is not a mere wall but a mountain as big as Mayon volcano of his beloved Bicol province. Dangerous, well-entrenched and have wide scope. Parlade reacted to Senate President Sotto saying that the cartel is exclusive to the BOC and should be solely investigated. He asked how about their other cohorts? How about the corrupt AFP officials involved in the cartel? Especially in Western Mindanao? Parlade sounded sure PBBM knows better. He reiterated his earlier statement regarding the cartel - they are bigger than we imagine. Even bigger than the elephant in the room just like what VP Leni said, the Senate room. Parlade revealed that the cartel knows only speaks one language and that is - you are either IN or OUT and you are TEAM player. Parlade commented that PBBM's political will be put to the test.

Pinoy Trending News,"Senator Robin Padilla has been called an ingrate by Marcos loyalists for writing an appreciation post to Kris Aquino, the Dutertes and Senator Bong Go for his highly successful senatorial bid while forgetting to acknowledged PBBM in that same FB post. Many Marcos Loyalists were so angry because of that FB post that some even swore this is going to be Senator Robin Padilla's first and last term in the senate. After a long silence from Senator Robin Padilla's camp, Mrs. Mariel Padilla, finally have spoken and belied that her husband did not thank PBBM, thus earning the ire of the Marcos loyalist who quickly declared war against the neophyte senator without getting their facts straight first. In a very brief FB post, Mrs. Padilla wrote that as early as May 14, with exclamation points for emphasis, her husband already thanked President PBBM. The first person he said his thank you of all people. May 14!!!! May 14 pa lang nagpasalamat na si Robin Padilla kay President BBM. Una siyang pinasalamatan bago ang lahat. Here is a photo of Robin with PBBM and Sen Bong Go during VP Sara Duterte's oath taking we greatly appreciate President BBM's kindness. A quick glance at the screengrabbed photo showed that indeed Senator Robin Padilla did write an appreciation FB post for PBBM via his FB post dated May 14, 2022. The actor turned politician called PBBM a personal friend whom he described as the most gentleman and no bullshit friend. Why did Senator Padilla called PBBM the most gentleman? Well, an incident during the debut of Ana Roces, wherein a drunk actor approached them and made nasty remarks but instead of answering back and create a scene, PBBM simply smiled and calmly walked away. Next, Senator Robin Padilla talked how PBBM did not hesitate to give him the stage during the UniTeam campaign sorties so he can campaign although at that time, he could not openly endorse PBBM because he is from PDP Laban and his party has yet to adopt PBBM as their presidential candidate. But when PDP Laban officially endorsed PBBM, Senator Padilla said he returned the favor and disengaged from UniTeam campaign sorties by visiting every crook and crannies in Mindanao to campaign for then presidential candidate and now President-elect PBBM.

In this case, before posting something on social media. Sonza was reacting to the tweet of journalist/blogger Raissa Robles asking about the identity of the old man in the photo she encircled in green highlighter which she also posted.

Pinoy Trending News,"According to retired Lt. General Antonio Parlade, President-elect BBM's decision to handle the Department of Agriculture, albeit in a temporary capacity, is a master stroke. Parlade agreed with Former DA Secretary Pinol that the cartels are now shaking on their boots, figuratively speaking and also DA's budget will be harassment-free by the people who runs it - lawmakers. In the next few paragraphs, General Parlade explained why he said PBBM taking the DA portfolio is a master stroke. If I was not mistaken, the General anchored his premise on a paper about the critical role of our border maritime control to our economy which he shared the screenshot below. The General wrote that an ordinary Department of Agriculture Secretary won't be able to stop rice and meat smuggling, abolish the carter and prevent hoarding. The cartel he revealed is bigger than we imagine. And many officials of other government agencies are part of the cartel. But PBBM at the helm of the DA, dismantling the cartel is a certainty. Parlade likened the dismantling of the cartel to ending our insurgency problem. Because it requires the President to chair for it to be a working whole-of-government mechanism like the NTF-ELCAC to end the local insurgency. Parlade revealed that one of the reasons why the ""players"" don't want a strong maritime defense because it will curbed smuggling. With smuggling contained, commerce is enhanced and more revenues generated. If no one blocks the strengthening of our maritime defense, Parlade stated, we will have more floating assets (Coast Guard and Navy ships) to guard our maritime borders. Buying maritime assets is an investment not an expense, Parlade argued. Lt. Gen. Parlade (ret) ended the FB post by leaving us a with strong argument why building a strong defense security means economic security. In other words, they feed on each other and as a result, we can feed our people. You may now read Lt. Gen. Paralde's original FB post below. PBBM taking the portfolio of the agricultural department? It is a master stroke sir. Former Sec Manny Pinol said it bluntly. Nanginginig na ang cartel at hindi na kayang i-harass ang budget ng DA by the same people who run it - legislators. This is something a typical DA secretary cannot do. Stop rice and meat smuggling, abolish the cartel, prevent hoarding. The cartel is bigger than we can imagine and many officials of other agencies of the government are part of it. It takes the Commander-in-Chief to dismantle it. This is like ending insurgency. It takes the President to chair the NTF-ELCAC for it to be a working whole-of-govt mechanism. Back to the cartel, this is one reason the 'players' do not want a strong maritime defense. With strong border protection, smuggling is curbed. Commerce is enhanced. More revenues generated. Kung walang kokontra, magkakaroon tayo ng mas madami pang floating assets, surveillance and interdiction assets, para lalo tayong secured. Investments ang tawag dun, not expense. That's how simple the national security ecosystem thrive, di ba mam Clarita Carlos? Your defense security translates to economic security and vice versa. They feed on each other. And then you feed can the people WELL. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A netizen who used the profile name FrNongnong (real Catholic priest) on Twitter sermoned the Marcos family, especially Senator Imee Marcos and of course PBBM about regaining of one's name which starts with admission of guilt. Followed by asking forgiveness from the people who have suffered. Then pay P203 estate taxes and other debts. And finally, accept history as written and correct the lies spewed. FrNongnong posted his brief sermon to the Marcos family in response to Senator Imee who was quoted by Philippine Star when asked whether PBMM will call Malacanang Palace their home. Senator Imee Marcos told reporters that there has been no decision yet if PBBM and his family will live in Malacanang. What is important is that the Marcos name will be redeemed, their family name, the legacy of their father will be revisited and studied thoroughly. And talking about Malacanang, not to sound a braggart, Senator Imee Marcos remarked they've been there and than that so basically, to live in Malacanang no longer thrills the Marcoses. They had lived their long enough, Senator Imee Marcos said. FrNongnong's tweet did not fail to get the attention of Atty. Darwin, a rabid anti-Dilawan social media influencer who is a fiscal by day and a Dilawan hater on his free time. In a very brief FB post, Atty. Darwin replied that BBM won without doing anything what he just said how to regain the integrity of their family name. Simply put, BBM's win was a big middle finger to him. BBM won without doing any of that. So that's the big FU to you right there. Atty. Darwin's response to FrNongnong has amused his FB followers. In 48 hours, it generated 4,400 reactions (half of which were laugh emojis) 563 comments and 116 shares and counting. Netizens quickly jumped into the comment section to express their opinion in regard to the FrNongnong's tweet. One netizen strongly disagrees with FrNongnong on the Marcoses having to correct the lies spewed for them to regain their integrity. They're the ones spewing lies, using the pulpit. A second netizen compares FrNongnong to the Pharisees of Jesus time. They are like the Pharisees in the Bible who have forgotten Jesus' teachings - Render to Ceasar what is Ceasar & to God what is God's. The days of Padre Damaso interfering in PH politics must end & we as voters have the power to stop them. And finally, a third netizen reiterated Atty. Darwin's statement that BBM's win was a big middle finger to the likes of FrNongnong who believed the Marcoses are guilty of sins and yet the 31M still gave him a super majority win.

Si Leni lang naman ang pumapel ng pumapel kasi gusto nga ibagsak ang pangulo para siya ang papalit. In fact, she did a lot of things that are not appropriate like requesting security briefings, reviewing the troops and saluting while the national anthem is played. She is a civilian and must not salute. The only civilian allowed to salute is the president, owing to the fact that he is commander in chief.

Pascual speculated that since the Angat Buhay NGO will be launched on June 30th, it is unlikely the outgoing VP will hire outsiders to prepare for the launching of her NGO. Pascual admitted that the OVP staffs are not prohibited to do tasks related to her NGO but doing NGO- related stuffs during office hours is. And Leni being the head of the NGO is technically has no definite office hours like the President because anytime, she can become President and assume the office of the President and therefore, she is expected to be working 24/7 for the government.

This is the fruit of the Duterte Gambit (friend to all, enemy to none) foreign policy which became the international relations formula on how a small nation can balance its relationships among superpowers without compromising their national interests by adopting the self-serving policy of foreign powers. Oh, ha? May Presidential aspirant na gaya gaya at hindi na-memorize yan in full. Hahahaha! Natatawa pa rin ako pag nare-remember ko! Hahahaha! I am happy that BBM is adopting the same policy and that he is now being more enabled with Clarita Carlos lending her technocratic expertise. The message of the Russia ambassador is very reassuring when it comes to Russia's commitment to helping our country's energy requirement. And, as a way of rewarding our independent foreign policy, Russia would surely sell oil to us at a friendlier rate. Let us continuously to be thankful kay Lord for He now has blessed us with two consecutive competent presidents. Just imagine the alternative na kung naging rosas ang bukas at lahat ng mga issues niya on foreign relations ay iaabot niya lang kay Forgetful Joe. Di ba?! Tse! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The appointment of Prof. Clarita Carlos as National Security Adviser of the incoming Marcos admin and her subsequent announcement that redtagging will be a thing of the past under the Marcos administration has been a welcome news for Leftist groups and their sympathizers. While it is true that the critics of the NTF-ELCAC were waiting with bated breath how former NTF-ELCAC Spokesman Lt. Gen. Parlade will react, perhaps anticipating he will go gaga over Prof. Carlos statement about ending redtagging, to the chagrin of the General's critics, he has nothing but good words for Prof. Carlos. In fact, he agreed with Prof. Carlos that redtagging should be put to rest because the 31M has already awaken. But before that, the retired General talked about reviewing his books while taking master studies in Ateneo and in Australia. Parlade remarked that after reading, he realized not much has changed especially those concepts on economic development by a certain Feliciano Fajardo. The takeaway from the Fajardo's books is that if the Philippines don't reform, our democracy will die. He urged Filipinos to understand how the communists DUPED Filipinos into thinking redtaggging is the issue which is not. Parlade said our problem as a people is that we are ignorant of their revolutionary dual tactics. Parlade went on to elaborate what he meant by this. For example, the communist talks of peace and yet bait us in violence. They claimed to be activists yet they are engaged in the armed struggle. The retired Lt. General ended the FB post by telling those people who rejoiced at the appointment of Prof. Carlos and her subsequent statement to just relax because redtagging, according to Parlade will be put to rest because the 31M has already awaken. He warned that country's greatest problem or challenge is not within but outside the country. You may now read Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade's original FB post below. Sobrang galing at talino ng nadesignate ni PBBM na NSA na si Prof Clarita Carlos. Napa review tuloy ako ng ilang books ko sa masteral studies sa Ateneo, US (2006), and Australia (2013). I realized not much has changed especially those concepts on economic development by Feliciano Fajardo. If we dont reform, our democracy will die. So, let's understand how these communists DUPED us into believing that redtagging is the issue. It is not. It is our ignorance of their revolutionary DUAL tactics. They talk of peace yet bait us in violence. They claim to be activists yet they are so engaged in the armed struggle. They talk human rights but they are the most vicious, tortuous, and most murderous armed group. They speak of corruption in government but they are the most exploitive extortionists we have known. They profess to be pro-poor but look at how their insurgency forfeited our funds for baranggay development and livelihood in favor of the wealthy. They speak of morals and humanity yet corrupt the minds of our youth to nurture hate against govt. Dun sa mga kumunistang natuwa sa appointment at statements ni incoming NSA, chill muna kayo dyan. Tutuldukan na natin ang isyung redtagging, sapagkat 31M na katao ang mulat na mulat na sa katotohanan. Hindi na tayo babalik sa madilim na karanasan natin sa mga teroristang ito. Mas matindi ang hinaharap natin sa rehiyon sa labas ng ating bansa. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Outgoing Vice President Leni Robredo statement saying she hopes her successor Vice President-elect Sara Duterte-Carpio will be continuing the projects she started has been met with raised eyebrows from the supporters of President Duterte and Marcos supporters, including fellow Bicolano vlogger Edwin Jamora. In a Facebook post, Jamora opened by asking for clarification what programs Leni Robredo was talking about she wants Inday Sara to continue? Jamora elaborated his question by asking more specific questions for Robredo to understand easily and of course, to avoid misunderstanding. Does she want Inday Sara to be Leni 2.0? He asked his followers to imagine Sara being Leni 2.0? For example, Inday Sara becoming anti-BBM, going down grassroots level to distribute anemic spaghetti, kropek, porridge and black olives? Including Inday Sara rendering a salute to the flag during a heavy downpour? Jamora slammed Leni Robredo for being ambitious whom he described as a presidential loser. Let us read the comments of netizens to see how they react. One netizen accused Robredo of copying the DOH program because she was just after the publicity. Nakakatawa nga eh. Yung mga ginagawa niya duplicate ng ginagawa ng DOH. Anak ng...gusto lang talaga lagi siya bida! Just like Jamora, netizens are apparently unaware of the programs started by Leni Robredo as Vice President. Which is none. Kaya gagawa talaga ng bago si ISD parang BBB ni Digong kasi walang silbi si panotay... may programa pala siya? asked another netizen. Sure but what program? I don't remember any? another netizen You may now read Edwin Jamora's tirade against outgoing VP Leni Robredo below. WUTT?! CONTINUE HER PROGRAMS?! Lintian! Mag-Leni 2.0 daw si Inday Sara!

Pinoy Trending News,"Senator-elect Robin Padilla has caused an uproar among BBM supporters, especially the Marcos loyalist, for crediting Kris Aquino and family, rather than BBM for his win in the senatorial race. The website Politiko turned Senator-elect Padilla's FB post thanking Ms. Kris A into a video. As per revelation of the Senator-elect Robin Padilla, Ms. Kris A reached out to him because of the alarming showing of her friend in the surveys released during middle of the campaign. Ms. Kris Aquino asked him about his campaign strategy. Senator-elect Padilla told Kris that his campaign strategy was conventional since he did not have much money. He told Ms. Kris A. he was banking on the support of Senator Bong Go, PRRD and Vice President-elect Sara Duterte and of course the Filipino people. [Link of video here] According to him, Ms. Kris Aquino offered to help and started calling politicians who are close to the Aquino family seeking support for his senate bid. And the rest, as they say, is history. For failing to credit BBM for his win, Senator-elect Padilla has earned the ire of the so-called Marcos loyalists who are now calling to boycott him in future election for being an ingrate. But make netizen Apple Jolo, a BBM-Sara tandem supporter in the last election, an exception. In a Facebook post, Jolo defended Robin Padilla's action, saying it is part of politics. She said it was natural for the Senator-elect to thank the people instrumental in his victory, especially his friend Kris Aquino who went out of her way to pull our all the stops despite her grave illness. Jolo urged the BBM supporters to move forward instead from the political wars and prejudice. She said is not dropping Padilla because she believes he has a special role to play in the Senate. Constitutional reform is important over petty things. Syempre, that's politics. You thank the people who helped you, funded you, made connections for you. It's a personal relationship anyway. He was merely thanking a friend. Kris is very sick and Robin is simply acknowledging the support he got from her despite her grave illness. Why take that against him? At some point, we have to start moving forward from the skirmishes and prejudice. I am not going to drop Padilla. He has a special purpose in Senate. Constitutional reform is more important. You can't build a strong backbone for the Filipinos if we keep pumping up hatred and cancel culture. Hatred is a form of weakness. You won't go far with that. This is just my opinion. I'm entitled to it. Enough of the irrelevant details. I would rather look at the bigger picture. ",1

Darwin offered in the brief FB post, I am sure has many, is to let go of faculty members who are known sympathizer of the Left asap. Here are the comments of Atty. Darwin's FB followers in reaction to the FB post? One netizen seconded the motion of Atty. Darwin. Exactly fire out professor, teachers and faculty who are enabler and party to bringing down government. A second commented that Atty. Darwin's recommendation isn't new. He will only believe this if the leftist sympathizers in the faculty have been fired from their post. A third netizen also said the same thing. Yes! Pronto! Public funds support them, while they ruin our young. STOP THEM I've heard this before.

Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu, admin of the FB page KLC Happy Thoughts Cellphone Repair, reacted in anger to Trillanes who said that giving outgoing President Duterte a grade of 1 out of 10 for his performance as leader is already too generous on his part. Trillanes explained that 1 out 10 rating for PRRD is justified, citing the prices of gasoline and rice which jumped from P30 pesos (liter of gasoline) and P23, P24 (kilo of rice) when he assumed office and now P70 and P38, P39 respectively before he steps down. In addition, Trillanes cited the country's national debt under the Duterte watch, which he said is now bigger than the combined debts of all previous presidents. PRRD supporters jumped into the comment section to share their opinion, expressing support for PRRD while castigating Trillanes. Nobody needs your validation, one netizen wrote in an emphatic tone. A second commented that Trillanes' opinion is irrelevant since he was even rejected last 2022 election. Antonio Trillanes. Applicant for senator, May 2022. Status: REJECTED. A third commented that PRRD's 80% approval rating at the end of his term, who bothers to believe Trillanes anyway. With 80% approval rating of PRRD at the end of his term who will believe you Trillanes. You are done. A fourth said Trillanes is out of touch and needs to see a doctor. Im sorry to say this to him. He is definitely out of touch and context sa mga pinagsasabi niya. I think he needs to see a doctor already. So much hate to any incoming and out going president is bad for ones health. A fifth who is commenting from Canada wrote that high prices of fuel is not unique to the Philippines. Canada who has its own fuel resources is also suffering from high fuel prices. Kahit dito po sa CA nagdouble ang presyo ng fuel (to think we have our own fuel resources) and all other commodities as compared to 10 yrs ago. It's global, not about PRRD! To which a Pinoy based in Europe echoed the sentiment of the Pinoy based in Canada. Hoooyyyy Trillianesss!! Dito nga sa Denmark ang presyo ng gasolina is currently 18,50 danish crowns.

Meanwhile, journalism is governed by ethical standards. Their work go through layers of specialist vetting for truthfulness and fairness, before being out for all the public to see. In that regard, Senator-elect Robin Padilla cannot let the opportunity to pass without reacting to the condescending remarks of the veteran journo against vlogger/bloggers covering Malacanang press briefings.

Senator-elect Padilla said that when we start identifying what is superior and inferior that's when freedom goes straight to the garbage bin. Senator-elect Padilla urged the veteran journo to read the Constitution because it does not state who is educated or not, who has a network or does not have. The newly-minted senator defended incoming Marcos administration's intention to give vloggers accreditation to the Malacanang press corps because it is a right of every Filipino as long as it doesn't violate any law or right of someone else.

Another prominent Robredo critic to join the bandwagon is Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu via her FB page KLC Happy Thoughts and Cellphone Repair. According to Ms. Chu, Robredo ran for President and yet, she look at the Philippines as a huge problem. Chu remarked this is expected if she wins, she will have to own all the problems in the Philippines. Chu called Robredo a clown for having such mindset.

Sonza opened the sermon of sorts that in the Karen Davila interview with incoming Finance Secretary of the Marcos administration is the prime example when you can catch a TV presenter who is stupid, pretending to know it all but in reality, she is just an empty head. Dito mo makikita kung gaano katanga ang isang announcer o program presenter sa telebisyon. Hindi lang boba, kundi nagpapanggap na may alam, samantalang, wala namang alam. Moral of the stolry: Mag-aral, manaliksik munang mabuti bago magbukas ng bunganga o bibig. Otherwise, the whole world will find out that you are as stupid as hell Meanwhile, a certain Angel Abella posted the transcript of the Karen Davila interview with Benjamin Diokno plus her side comments, which radio host Mark Lopez shared in his wall Karen Davila said: ""I will make it simple, ""Walang pera ang gobyerno! So you will be facing a lot of challenges as the new Finance Secretary of the incoming Marcos administration. So what is the plan?"" This was her premise when she shot her first question to Ben Diokno, anticipating that the former BSP Governor will make a litany of the failures of the outgoing Duterte administration. But lo, and behold, her jaw almost drop when the finance genius answered: - I had the benefit of having served the government for more than 30 years, and I have seen all kinds of crisis. I've seen worst of our economy, but we are in a better position now. Prior to the Duterte administration, we were heavily indebted, and had a hard time arguing with the IMF. Before, our foreign reserves will last for only 2-months atleast. But with the Duterte admin, we have at least 9-months worth of import reserves; -Currently, we do not have a problem with paying our debts which is mostly domestic than foreign, and we are a net contributor to the IMF; -The Duterte admin has the best tax structure than the previous admin that can help the Marcos leadership: - -The Duterte administration is the golden years of infrastructure for our country due to the Build, Build, Build program where the government spent from 5 to 6% of the GDP, and gave us better airports, and better seaports that boost our international trading. It created jobs, high quality jobs, and expands the capacity to gain economic growth. This is unlike the previous administrations where the Philippines was branded as the poorest in infrastructure in Asia because they only spent less than 2% for infrastructure; -Now we have the Public Service Act that is a 90-year program, allowing 100% foreign investments for big ticket projects like telcos, airports, subways and other similar projects; We have a standing 80 plus programs from the current administration that will be continued by the Marcos leadership. -We have a goal of achieving a 70% digitalization of all transactions, and the like. Finally, Ben Diokno said, that we have plans for the economic future of the country, and we will be ready. And then suddenly, Karen Davila lost her glow, and showed her true face. I am just confused, why Karen and her kind, like that woman hosting the Mangahas Interview, are so eager to see the government fail Are they not Filipinos? Don't they live here? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"After licking his wounds for getting crushed by VP-elect Sara Duterte in the vice presidential election last May 9, Senator Kiko Pangilinan issued a statement daring the incoming Marcos administration to provide a solution to the widespread hunger in the country and rising prices of food. Senator Pangilinan said that it is imperative for the incoming Marcos administration to prepare for the looming crises of food and hunger. Meanwhile, Senator Pangilinan's advice or dare to the incoming Marcos administration was met with question from Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous. Basically, Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, ANC host Ms. Karen Davila preached to her Twitter followers in particular and the incoming Marcos admin that moving forward doesn't mean erasing history. ""Recognizing the wrongs of the past and demanding accountability doesn't mean you are against a united country, ""Ms. Karen Davila argued. Ms. Karen Davila wrote that ""a stronger democracy & better governance is only possible with TRUTH. Huwag po natin burahin ang kasaysayan"". Of course, we understand to whom Ms. Davila was addressing the tweet since we know she belongs to the anti-Marcos forces who fear since the Marcoses are in power now, they will start the process of historical revisionism in the next 6 years. Taking the cue from Ms. Karen Davila since she talked about moving forward does not necessarily mean erasing history, Marcos loyalist and Bicolano vlogger/writer and CPA Edwin Jamora dared mainstream media to provide answers to the 6 questions he enumerated in his FB post and only then he will believe of their sincerity in saying that a stronger democracy and better governance is only possible with the truth.

Sinong president ang nagtago sa ilalim ng kama? 2. Sinong president ang nagbigay ng state burial para sa isang aso? 3. Sinong diktador ang hindi dumaan sa judicial process? Remember, Martial Law was recommended by Congress and was later affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its declaration was in accordance with the 1935 Constitution. Yung diktador na tinatanong ko ay naging diktador na hindi alinsunod sa kahit na anumang Constitution? 4. At dahil bumubula ang mga bibig ninyo nang mag-rape joke si President Duterte, sino naman ang nagsabi ng ""If it is inevitable, just relax and enjoy it."" noong tinanong siya kung ano ang maipapayo sa mga Filipina na naipit sa Kuwait noong sinakop ni Sadam Hussein ang Kuwait kung saan may nire-rape ng mga Filipina? 5. Dahil sabi ninyo na walang press freedom sa time ni President Duterte sa kabila ang paninira ninyo sa kaniya, sino namang president ang nagdemanda ng libel laban sa isang journalist? 6. Kung magkapag-react kayo tungkol sa pangako na ibaba sa P20.00 ang isang kilo ng bigas, sino namang presidente ang nangako na ibababa sa P1.00 ang presyo ng galunggong? Hinding hindi fake news yan.

President-elect BBM made the revelation during the press con yesterday with representatives from Net25, SMNI News and GMA7 that PRRD specifically asked him to continue the anti-drug war campaign ""to save the youth"". ""Our youth will be miserable, their lives would be ruined, if you will discontinue it. Here's how netizens react to idea of outgoing President Duterte as President-elect BBM's anti-drug war czar. One netizen wrote that the position perfectly fits President Rodrigo Duterte because he started it anyway. It is a very fitting job for Pres. Duterte as drug czar because during his presidency we all witness his staunch campaign against drug dealers and drug users. A second commenter wrote that PRRD as drug czar and senior adviser is a nice combo. Nice combo! A drug czar and advisor as well. Duterte being a friend to Marcos and father of the VP can fit in any cabinet position comfortably and confidently. A third urged PRRD to accept the offer to make our progress faster if the menace of illegal drugs are eliminated. Tatay tanggapin nyo napo para mas mapadali Ang pag angat natin pag Wala na Ang salot na droga Meanwhile, some netizens are lukewarm to the idea and want to give PRRD the time to rest and enjoy his retirement with family. I'd like that but only if PRRD wants it, I think he deserves the rest a day more time with his family. This netizen wants PRRD to have a vacation after working hard for 6 years and then, he can accept the post. PRRD needs a vacation first after being so exhausted with pandemic and his war on drugs.

In fact, of the 7,218 reactors, 6,500 reactors hit the laugh emoji on Facebook. Here are some of the entertaining comments from netizens for our amusement. One netizen wrote that perhaps their gates are pro-Leni but the owners are BBM-Sara supporters. baka yung gate lang ang maka Leni, yung nakatira maka BBM-Sara A second netizen joked that the Kakampink should also make sure to also register not just the gates but also the cars etc.. Sama na nila ang mga kotse, lobo, dekorasyon, stage, halaman, flaglets, payong, sumbrero at mga aso na iparehistro. Pati yung mga nasa google trends at mga taga-ibang bansa na mga indiano.

Pinoy Trending News,"Caloocan Assistant Prosecutor, if I am not mistaken, Atty. Darwin Canete shared his thoughts on Leni camp's statement expressing continuing manifestation that they interpose no objection to the inclusion of all COCs via her lawyer, Atty. Romulo Macalintal. In a Facebook post, Atty. Darwin complimented, albeit not in a nice way, Leni Robredo's strategy, calling it ""madugas"" or deceitful. Why? Atty. Darwin said Robredo's move of not challenging the canvassing of COCs because if ever the Supreme Court will decide on their favor regarding petition against BBM, she can readily accept this because her camp can claim that BBM's 31M votes are stray votes. Hence, Leni Robredo refused to categorically admit losing to BBM so that her camp's petition at the SC will not be affected, in case she is the beneficiary of a favorable decision. Atty. Darwin ended the brief FB to tell Leni Robredo that if they thought they can get away with such rotten style, they are mistaken. Here are some of the comments of netizens expressing their opinion on Leni Robredo's ""strategy"". One netizen wrote that Leni camp's plan is no fool-proof because after BBM-Sara are proclaimed today, Sara will replace BBM if the court favors their petition at the SC asking to declare BBM's COC void ab initio. SC was obviously not gonna issue a TRO because they give bbm camp and comelec 15days to reply.. Now kung ma proclaim na mamaya and by some miracle e grant ng SC yung petition. Sara as VP, will replace BBM.. Still a no-no for those Pinklawan idiots A second netizen also shared the same line of reasoning. well true. Pag na proclaim na mamya yan moot and academic na sa SC.

Pinoy Trending News,"A supporter of Leni Robredo on Twitter using the profile name Maldita of Manila is testing Presumptive President BBM's message of UNITY by asking him to appoint known personalities from the ranks of the Dilawans like Leni, Kiko, Roxas and Bam. Otherwise, she is not buying Marcos' message of unity. BTW, Mar and Bam are not covered by the appointment ban because they did not run in this election. In that regard, Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous can't resist the urge to figuratively slap the Twitter netizen with the Constitution out of frustration. Why? Atty. Ahmed wondered if Maldita of Manila read the Philippine Constitution because if she did, she would know that President has the sole power to appoint members of the cabinet. According to Atty. Ahmed, the Constitution did not say that the President is obliged to appoint people oppose of the administration. In addition, the Constitution did not state that the President may appoint stupid losers in the election. Atty. Ahmed said that perhaps Maldita of Manila does not understand the meaning of democracy. Think about it she insist in appointing people who were rejected by the public. Atty. Ahmed joked that perhaps Maldita of Manila has forgot to take her meals. This is indeed not easy.

From what I understand you are a Fil-Am right? Why have you got any right to insult a large proportion of the Philippine electorate? No sir, these citizens of the Republic of the Philippines are not stupid at all, I have met so many people who voted for BBM, many come from academic backgrounds, university educated with a strong sense of responsibility and sense of duty. They are Filipinos who are proud of their country and spent so much time considering who would be best to lead the country moving forward. But even those who didn't have the benefit of a university education like myself or even a good education, support Sir BBM and Ma'am Inday Sara with our hearts, minds and understanding, we are not STUPID! Those who cause division and insult others are more entitled to be called stupid than those who are only exercising their rights? I have no doubt that EVERY single voter in the Philippines has cast their vote based on their own personal choice and I am also share they have exercised that right with care and a sense of responsibility. Just because they don't share the same voting preferences as yourself doesn't mean you can call your fellow countrymen stupid. How dare you!!!! This is the kind of toxic culture in the Philippines that's pulling the country down and will mean it will always be hard for the Philippines to progress, insulting your fellow man will only make things worse. Let's all respect that personal choices and preferences of each other, spread love and unity, not hate. Regards, Malcolm Conlan Foreigner with a Filipino family and heart. Concerned netizen, UK ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Dubbed the Immortal One by his fans in the internet because of his longevity in Philippine politics, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, one of the brilliant legal luminaries in the country, has shared his coveted legal opinion regarding the petition filed in the Supreme Court by anti-Marcos forces asking to declare his COC void ab initio. In a Facebook post published on the 21st of May 2022, Senator Enrile said that in the absence of a TRO to Congress to stop the canvassing, the petition has become moot and academic. You may continue reading below and let Senator Enrile explain to you what this means. The petition to disqualify Bongbong Marcos has become moot and academic without a TRO from the Supreme Court. The High Court has kept faith to its role in our constitutional system. It is the legal balancer and stabilizer in our society. It stood firm against the incorrigible trouble makers in our society. It immediately saw the silly maneuver of the desperate political opposition. Now the road is clear for the formal proclamation by Congress of Bongbong and Sara as the winners in the recent presidential race. Their only recourse will be impeachment, if there is a ground, later on. Even that is nebulous. bbm and SA Here are some of the reactions from netizens.

Pinoy Trending News,"Perhaps out of euphoria, a day after Robin Padilla's proclamation as the newly-minted senator, the supporters of President Duterte are now talking early that the action star-turned senator may be one of the top VP contenders in 2028 election. MJ Quiambao Reyes, social media influencer and staunch Duterte supporter, believes that Robin Padilla's PRRD-like charisma, sense of humor, patriotism and common sense makes him a strong contender for VP and even presidential contender in 2028. That depends of course, according to Reyes, on Senator Robin Padilla's performance in the next 6 years while listen and learn from the masters. A Sara-Robin tandem in 2028 would be great to have and perhaps one of them as Prime Minister should the charter change prosper and become a reality. For now, Reyes urged her followers to focus and lend the incoming BBM-Sara tandem the support they need including staying vigilant and offering constructive criticisms and suggestions when necessary. As of this writing, 3,000+ netizens seem to share MJ Reyes' sentiment that Senator Robin Padilla could be a strong VP contender and tandem of Presumptive Vice President Sara Duterte for the 2028 polls. Here are some of the comments of netizens. One netizen commented expressing one's favorable opinion to Robin Padilla as future VP contender. Yan din ang nakikita ko. Pero malayo pa ang tatahakin niya. Tingnan natin ang pagka senador niya muna. A second netizen also expressed the same sentiment as the above commenter. Why not? Robin is a very dedicated and down-to-earth kind of person with a big heart! A third netizen rebuke MJ Reyes for talking politics this early because the presumptive President has yet to assume Malacanang. Ms MJ di pa nga nakakaupo ang ating majority elected prez eh..politics kaagad ang topic nyo. Forget po muna natin ang politics...focus muna tau sa pag bangon ng ating bansa. Nakakaumay pa sa ngaun ang politics... Huwag muna masyadong sipsip..tho i admire ur wits.. You may now read MJ Quiambao Reyes' original FB post below. With Robin Padilla's PRRD-like charisma, sense of humor, patriotism, and common sense, he'll likely be one of the top VP or may be even Prexy contenders in 2028. Of course, that is, if he does well as senator for the next 6 next yrs (and listen and learn more from the masters ;)). Let's see... It sure would be great to have Sara-Robin 2028 - or who knows, perhaps one of them as Prime Minister, should he succeed sa Charter Change.

Pinoy Trending News,"In case you missed it, Atty. Theodore Te and company has filed a petition before the Supreme Court to declare BBM's COC void ab initio or void from the very beginning. In addition, the petitioners is asking the Supreme Court to issue a restraining order to stop the canvassing of votes by both houses of Congress and the declaration of BBM as the winner of the presidential polls. The petitioners also want Leni Robredo declared as President because she garnered the second highest votes among the presidential candidates. [Link here] However, if you asks veteran lawyer Atty. Arturo de Castro, this SC case against Presumptive President BBM is an exercise in futility. You may read his brief FB post below. An exercise in futility. The sovereign people have spoken. BBM won by a landslide. Under the Political Question Doctrine, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case. Antonio v. Aguinaldo. The case is divisive and runs against the grain of established jurisprudence. Atty. de Castro went on to elaborate on this in the comment section for clarity sake. Here is the relevant jurisprudence. In the Labo case in Baguio City. Labo was disqualified to sit as Mayor being an Australian Citizen. The Vice Mayor was proclaimed Mayor. The mayoralty candidate who garnered the next highest number of votes was not proclaimed mayor elect because he did not win as Mayor. Subsequently after the Labo case, the Supreme Court held that the candidate who got the next highest number of votes would be proclaimed because the disqualified winner is not considered a candidate and could not be voted for. Under this ruling Leni would be proclaimed if BBM would be disqualified. In another case, the Supreme Court made this qualification. If a candidate is disqualified before the election moves for a reconsideration and wins the election but his motion for reconsideration is denied he cannot sit because he is disqualified. The implication of this ruling is in favor of BBB because he was not disqualified when he was elected and the political question doctrine applies ousting the high court jurisdiction to entertain the case. In the Antonio v Aguinaldo case I handled in the Supreme Court in banc Aguinaldo was disqualified by Comelec on a Friday afternoon before the Monday election. The Supreme Court issued a TRO allowing Aguinaldo to be voted for and to win by a landslide. The Supreme Court dismissed my petition based on the political question doctrine citing the latin Maxim Vox Populi Vox Die. This would apply to BBM unless it would be shown he did not win the election. The maxim presumes he won. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"An apparently annoyed Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu lashed out at supporters of Leni Robredo who are still throwing tantrums and even blaming the so-called anti-Marcos voters and trolls for the crushing defeat of their presidential bet in the 2022 polls. Chu began the rant by asking who were so stupid to urge Leni Robredo to run despite being the least liked government official? The Kakampinks. Chu said that if they just used their brains, they should have realized that someone who is the least trusted government official, lowest satisfaction ratings, since 2017 Leni's ratings were low is no match against somebody whose platform is unity and continuity. Chu remarked that whoever wave the flag of unity and continuity would automatically get a big chunk of votes. Even the anti-Marcos like her were forced to support BBM to prevent Leni from winning. Chu said that Leni Robredo's candidacy presented many red flags and yet, they pushed her to run. She was livid that the Kakampinks are pinning the blame on the anti-Marcos for their debacle. Chu said the Kakampinks were morons, and now its the anti-Marcos fault? Kakairita na. Una sa lahat, sinong engot ang pinatakbo si Leni Robredo despite being the least liked government official? Kayo. Kung nag iisip kayo, dapat na realize nyo na walang panama ang LEAST TRUSTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, lowest satisfaction ratings, since 2017 mababa ang ratings, sa platform of unity and continuity. Whoever waved that flag, would automatically get a big chunk of votes. Tapos pati kaming anti Marcos napilitan na suportahan sya para lang di manalo si Leni.

Pinoy Trending News,"In response to the petition of Atty. Theodore Te and company asking the Supreme Court to declare the COC (Certificate of Candidacy) of the Presumptive President Bongbong Marcos void ab initio, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza argued this is a futile exercise on the part of the petitioner. Sonza recalled that the Supreme Court already issued a statement that BBM cannot be disqualified using moral turpitude argument on the same case as income tax filing and payment which was already decided by the SC. Sonza asked if the petitioners aren't just wasting their time. They even asked TRO to stop Congress from doing its constitutional mandate and duties to canvass and declare the winners of the presidential and vice presidential elections. Here's the part which I think supporters of Kakampink who are praying to the high heavens that the SC will rule in their favor will hate Sonza even more...According to Sonza, the Supreme Court stopping Congress to do its principal mandate as written in the Constitution has never happened ever. They are acting like stupid, correct? Sonza asked. Sonza ended the FB post saying that no Magistrate in his or her own right frame of mind will dare to DQ of a duly elected President voted by overwhelming 31 million Filipinos with a winning margin of 16 million voters over closest rival. You may now read Jay Sonza's original FB post below. Hindi nga ba at sinabi na ng Supreme Court noon pa hindi maaring i-disqualify si Marcos dahil walang usaping moral turpitude sa naunang kaso niya. Heto naman tayo ngayon at umakyat pa sila Korte Suprema, gamit ang argumento na may usaping moral turpitude si BBM sa same case of income tax filing at payment which was already decided by the Supreme Court. Hindi kaya nagsasayang lang oras itong mga petitioner. Tapos humihingi pa ng TRO para pigilan ang Kongreso na isagawa ang kanilang consitutional mandate at duties to canvass and declared the winners of the presidential and vice presidential elections. Kahit kailan, hindi pa nangyari na napigilan ng Korte ang Kongreso na gawin ang kanyang principal mandate, na itinakda ng Saligang Batas. Parang tanga lang, hindi ba? No magistrate in his/her own right frame of mind, will go for the disqualification of a duly elected, by an overwhelming votes of over 31 million Pilipino people, with a margin of over 16 million votes against his closet rival candidate and over 2 million votes over the total number of votes cast for second running candidate.

Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, Kapamilya actress Liza Soberano allegedly retweeted the tweet of a certain @unvrslcnsprcy who urged Pinoys to let that sink in Robin Padilla garnered more votes than Leni Robredo in the 2022 polls and the OP called this phenomenon a f*cking joke. In that regard, the Luminous can't help but react to Liza Soberano's retweet. Basically, Atty. Trixie's response to Liza Soberano's retweet revolves around enlightening the Filipina- American actress how Philippine election works and even in many parts of the globe. For example, the candidate who garners the most number of votes wins. And to get the votes, each candidate is given the chance to convince as many voters as he/she can in the campaign period. Otherwise, the most number of voters will go to the other candidate. After the ballots are counted, the winners are declared. And the loser, ideally concedes, accepts the winner, no matter how funny or ridiculous that sounds to her. And finally, Atty. Trixie pointed out to Liza Soberano that having condescending attitude based on the choice of candidate doesn't make her the darling to the majority who did not vote for her choice. That kind of attitude did not make her convincing as an endorser. You may now read Atty. Trixie's original FB post below. But that is how elections work, Ms. Soberano. The one with the most number of votes wins. The campaign period is when you try to convince the voters to go for your candidate. And if you failed to convince them, then the most number of votes DON'T go to your candidate. After that you accept the winner, no matter how funny or ridiculous that sounds to you. And by the way, looking down on our choice of candidate doesn't exactly endear you to the majority who voted against your choice. Kaya hindi kayo convincing eh. The caveat is, we don't know if indeed this is Liza Soberano's legit Twitter account if the actress even own one in the absence of the blue check beside the Twitter profile name, signifying its legitimacy. Or perhaps, she was just too busy to even bother to do the steps to receive the blue check. ",1

She has been a senator for some time and yet she remain ""shunga"" aka stupid. Atty. Nick explained that Cabinet members are the President's alter ego. The appointing power is the sole domain of the President. Now, Atty. Nick wants to know if Senator Hontiveros is President, then her opinion matter? He remarked that if the Presumptive President likes to Sara to lead DepEd, what can she do? If she opposes Sara's appointment because of CA (Commission of Appointment) it will come down to a vote. Now the question is, how many votes does Senator Hontiveros thinks she has? The truth of the matter, is it correct to say that Senator Hontiveros' allies has been saying that BBM has no college degree? So, if Senator Hontiveros thinks Sara is not qualified to be the next DepEd Secretary, what more does Hontiveros thinks of BBM who wields the power to appoint? Following Senator Hontiveros' logic, does she thinks the one with appointing power has no K? As in karapatan? Right? If Hontiveros does not wish to recognize BBM, well she has no other choice. Atty.

Sa katunayan pa nga, diba ang ibinabato ng mga kabagang mo e walang degree si #BBM? So, kung walang K si #Sara maging Kalihim, pano na lang si BBM na may appointing power?

Lopez said this is the reason why she lost and lost big time. Too much fakery and over the top hypocrisy. Lopez isn't buying the sleeping on the airport drama of Leni Robredo (some netizen pointed out the sleeping lady is either Jillian or Aika) because the PSG won't allow her to sleep in that condition.

Nick of the FB page Nick Nangit - NCN Law shared his legal opinion on the issue raised by petitioner Atty. Theodore Te before the SC. Basically, Atty. Nick cited 3 major reasons why the petition to declare BBM's certificate of candidacy will be dismissed because of lack of merit. Let me cite reason #3 as per Atty. Nick's legal opinion and that is the Supreme Court does not hear disputed basis of facts or a trier of facts. You may now read Atty. Nick's original FB post below. Hindi pa rin natatahimik sina Te, at iniakyat pa sa SC ang petisyong ikansela ang kandidatura ni BBM at pahintuin ang pagdedeklara ng pagkapanalo nito. Una, may tinatawag tayo na tapos na ang boksing o ""moot and academic"". Natapos na ang eleksyon. Bakit ikakansela pa ang sertipika ng pagkakandidato? Pangalawa, ang ComElec na mismo - en banc at mga dibisyon nito - ang nagsalita, tas gusto niya isantabi ang mga Resolusyon, gayung wala naman siyang patunay na may napakabigat na pang-aabuso sa pagpapasya o ""grave abuse of discretion"" na isang rekisito sa nasabing petisyon. Pangatlo, ang SC ay hindi dumidinig ng mga pinagtatalunang basehan ng katotohanan o ""trier of facts"" kundi mga isyu o ""issues"" lamang. Ano kaya ang mga bagong dahilan na hindi pa tinalakay sa ComElec? Gaya nang ilang beses ko nang sinabi sa lahat ng panayam sa akin sa TV radyo at podcasts na malamang isasawalang-bahala lang ito o ""dismiss"", gayung wala naman kasing sustansya o ""merit"".

Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the news that the presumptive President Bongbong Marcos appointed presumptive Vice President as the next DepEd Secretary, just re-elected Senator Risa Hontiveros issued a statement saying to the effect that the next DepEd Secretary should be an Education expert. In that regard, Rocky Marciano, a staunch supporter of the BBM-Sara tandem wasted no time in demolishing Senator Risa Hontiveros' assertion that Sara is not qualified to head the Department of Education because she is not an education expert. Marciano cited mark Villar, Art Tugade and Roy Cimatu of the Duterte admin as prime examples that Senator Hontiveros argument that you need to be an expert of the government department to be an effective head. But wait until the last part... Marciano told Hontiveros to examine herself before she opens her mouth. Why? Marciano said Hontiveros isn't even a lawyer or even a political scientist but a journalist. What are you doing in the senate? Marciano asked Hontiveros. Marciano pointed out to Hontiveros that a Cabinet job is an administrative job. As long as an appointee have managerial skills and experience qualifies him/her for the job. You may now read Rocky Marciano's original FB post below. Mark Villar is not a Civil Engineer. He's an MBA graduate. He was appointed as DPWH Secretary. Now look around you. Art Tugade is not a Mechanical Engineer. He's a lawyer. He's appointed as the Secretary of Transportation. Look how improved our transport system. Roy Cimatu is a military man. Not a natural or environmental scientist. Look at Manila Bay and Boracay. And many more. And take a look at yourself. You're not a lawyer. You're not even a political scientist. You're a journalist. So what are you doing there in the Senate? A cabinet job is an administrative job. As long as you have managerial skills and experience, you are qualified for the job. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes wasted no time in accusing the Human Rights Watch of attacking BBM even before he could assume the presidency because of ulterior motives. In a Facebook post, Reyes rebuked the Human Rights Watch for already starting to BBM what they did to PRRD in the last 6 years. How? The same tactic of weaponizing human rights issues like journalists getting harassed and not given access to the information they want from the President, this time the presumptive president. They immediately run to the international community, rights-respecting countries and associations of journalists and report that BBM is a threat to democracy. They urged the donor countries and international community to fight the harassment of Marcos admin. Reyes reminded the Human Rights Watch that they are so wrong in so many levels. First and foremost, this is still under the Duterte administration. Second, almost all of the major media and broadcasting companies have attacked the Marcoses left and right throughout the campaign, so they can't expect the Marcoses to trust them. At this juncture, Reyes accused the Human Rights Watch for going this low for the sake of the multi-million grants, funds, investments, & donations from donor-countries and organizations. And finally, assured the Human Rights Watch that if PBBM tramples upon the freedom and rights of its people, she and fellow BBM supporters will make noise and fight his administration. Until then, Reyes told Human Rights Watch to stay in the background and just support but remain vigilant and most of all- refrain from black propaganda. You may now read MJ Reyes' original FB post. Oi, Human Rights Watch & lamestream media, ano na naman yan? Di pa nga nakakaupo yung mama ay ginagawa nyo na sa kanya ang ginawa nyo ng 6 yrs kay Pangulong Duterte.

Una, nasa Duterte admin pa tayo, ui! Pangalawa, halos lahat nga ng major media and broadcasting companies left and right ang tira sa mga Marcoses all through out the campaign. Kaya wala ng tiwala sa inyo ang taumbayan, eh. How low can many of you go just to stay relevant and get those multi million grants, funds, investments, & donations from donor-countries and organizations? Pangatlo, kung sakali man na babalahurain ng susunod na administrasyon ang kalayaan at ang kapakanan ng taumbayan, kami mismo ang unang mag iingay at lalaban.

Some are even vocal in social media in expressing their desire to leave the country because they can't just stand to live in a country run by their most hated enemies - the Marcoses and the Dutertes who will be running the political show in the next 12 years possibly. Of course, not all Kakampinks have the finances to fly away to a country of their choosing and then return when Dilawans/Kakampinks regain power. In that regard, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu has offered a tantalizing proposition, albeit in jest, to the Kakampinks who wants to go somewhere but don't have the means.

All 9,842 votes for President-all, not majority, all-went to Leni Robredo. Di ba parang heaven? Shangri-La! Paradise! Garden of Eden. So para sa mga wala pong pang migrate sa ibang bansa, pero may pang Lanao del Norte, Pantao Ragat is your home away from home. A landlocked municipality in the coastal province of Lanao del Norte, spanning nearly 4 percent of the province's area, Pantao has a grand population of 30,427-which means it can accommodate millions of you who do not want to reintegrate into society that has given BBM a chance to lead. As it is not an urban hotspot, you can plan your excursions into the city. Fancy a jaunt to Marawi? You may see the new developments going there. Head on to Iligan, home to what I hear is really good lechon and ohemgeeeee, Maria Cristina Falls. There are so many beautiful places in Misamis Occidental where you can while your time away before you go home to your peaceful little Kakampink commune in Pantao Ragat. I hear too that Pantao had 3.98kha of natural forest, which made up 70 percent of its land area, but deforestation rate is high in the area, but can you imagine how beautiful it must be. So, please, instead of getting stressed, and cursing everyone around you to suffer, you may choose to find solace in the beauty of Pantao Ragat.

Clearly, Carpio's agenda is not for the good of the Motherland Philippines but for the good of others. A second wrote that BBM's victory means the admins after Marcos Sr, from Cory to PNoy failed to improve the lives of ordinary Pinoys and it was only PRRD who give Filipinos a sampling of what life would have been like had the Yellows delivered what they promised in EDSA. It means that the administrations after Marcos Sr, from Cory Aquino to her son PNoy, failed to uplift the lives of ordinary Filipinos. The promise of EDSA to Daang Matuwid remained just as that, an empty promise. Only during the PDuterte administration that we got a taste of different brand of service and boosted our morale as a Filipino. The 31M hope that another Marcos will continue this type of governance and the rest of the world who think otherwise can suck it up.

Well, Ms. Solis took to IG to rub salt on the wounded egos of celebs with millions of followers whom she described as ""ubod ng yabang"" supporting their candidate. Solis wanted to see how these arrogant celebs accept that their star power did not help their candidate win. Instead, Solis thinks their endorsement did more harm than good because majority of Filipino voters found the celeb endorsers huge turnoffs because of their arrogance. Solis said she hope this will serve as the lesson for these celebs to draw a dividing line between their roles in showbiz and in politics. Solis conceded that yes, people watch their rallies, followed them around but never listened to them. Solis told the celeb endorsers of Leni not to act super righteous, it hurts the ears and irritating. For now, Solis advised the celebs to push down the brakes.

Duterte campaigned as he ruled-no frills, no extra, no drama, just straight up no fucks given, pragmatic and practical No celebrities, no fireworks, no grand gowns or designer outfits. His campaign videos were just talking heads with not a lot of production value. His government programs were the same, just quiet service. Although we spent for the Dubai Expo, and the Venice Biennale, PRRD wouldn't really attend arts and culture events. BBM will be the exact opposite. As I watched the fireworks display last night from my TV screen I realized his administration will be one of glorious displays of our arts, culture, beauty, optics. His wife Liza was in a Lesley Mobo. Everything will be staged to be grandiose. There will be celebrations everywhere. And many of them will be Imeldific. The austerity of the Duterte administration will be completely replaced by the ostentatiousness of a Marcos one. Will it be good for our pride, for our psyche? Our sense of self and our cultural identity, or will it distract us from where we should focus on? Very anxious but also hopeful about this new path we're taking as a country ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Fact: Leni Robredo has been endorsed from various groups like Doctors for Leni etc. Fact: BBM isn't endorsed by various groups similar to Leni Robredo has been getting. Fact: BBM is leading by wide margin in all poll surveys except those conducted by unknown poll firms that surfaced lately. However, the sweetest endorsement for BBM, IMO, is an endorsement from anti-Marcoses like the endorsement BBM receives from a very well-known pro-Duterte but anti-Marcos social media influencer named Krizette Laureta Chu of the Manila Bulletin. In a Facebook post that is trending now, Ms. Chu cited 8 reasons why she is voting BBM despite experiencing stabbing in her chest knowing she is voting for someone she is very against until late in the campaign period. Number 1 on Ms. Chu's list why she is voting BBM because among all presidential hopefuls, he is the only one who promised to continue Duterte's big ticket projects + NTF-ELCAC. Chu said that BBM's commitment to continue NTF-ELCAC is the biggest reason for any anti-Marcos with a functioning brain. Chu ended the FB post by reiterating that her most delicious pleasure is to let a Marcos oust, she means succeeds, a Duterte. Not Leni and company whom she said has been scheming to ""OUST DUTERTE"" in the last 6 years. As of this writing, Chu's FB post has generated 20,000+ reactions, 1,400 comments and 3,300 shares in just 2 hours and counting. You may continue reading Ms. Chu's 7 other reasons below why BBM despite she is a hardcore anti-Marcos. WHY BBM? ANTI MARCOS EDITION Reasons why anti Marcoses will vote Marcos this election despite the stabbing pain in their chests: 1. He is the only one among all the candidates who promised to continue Duterte's big ticket projects + NTF ELCAC-which is the biggest reason for any anti Marcos with a functioning brain. The runner up-Leni Robredo-doesn't even understand what ELCAC is and so keeps changing her mind about supporting it. Gross. 2. He is the only one who is aligned with the Dutertes (Sara, and her two brothers) and is assumed to protect the President, after 6 years of PRRD's controversial and aggressive drug war and anti-terrorist efforts. It is an unspoken agreement, you continue to honor this and we will continue to honor our commitment to support. 3. He is the only one who showed respect to the old man. Leni, Isko, Ping, and Manny all attacked PRRD to further their career. It is still one of his wisest decisions so far to be the only candidate seen as pro Duterte government. That easily captured a very big market. 4. Sara Duterte's endorsement 5. Despite being goaded by PRRD to reply to subtle attacks, he never took the bait. Shows restraint, respect, diplomasya. He knows what's good for him. It will serve him well, a marked difference from Leni's anti China rhetoric and stupid knee jerk reactions to any complicated issue she doesn't even understand. 6. Leni is the worst Presidential candidate to ever walk the earth. Many of her supporters are the most toxic human beings to pollute this planet. Isama mo na yung balloons nila. A vote for BBM is a revenge vote against this toxic group from humanity's most toxic political camp. 7. We may not like his past, and his baggage, but the future is another thing. Some of us agree with his plans on the environment, on agriculture, on technology's role in government. We will continue to ask for accountability and never forget, and make sure that agencies in pursuit of Marcos wealth are not abolished, and that we continue to pay reparation to victims of Martial Law, but we also need to move towards a future. 8. Leni pretends to be independent, but her Cabinet will be the Yellows-because who else does she know? Her campaign manager is Yellow, her Senators are Yellow. Who wants a return of the Yellow government? BBM can no longer tap his father's cronies-they're all dead or have been reduced to normal citizens after their exile-so he'll probably work with some of the Duterte government best people. And that's good. We will cross the bridge on BBM's other issues after the elections. Not now. Now we need a strategic vote. We will be the biggest critics when needed, and biggest supporters when deserved. We will be the middle ground between the rabid critics and the rabid supporters. For 6 years Leni and her minions called to ""OUST DUTERTE,"" it is our most delicious pleasure to give them the biggest middle finger by letting a Marcos oust Duterte. Ginusto nyo yan. ANTI-MARCOS FOR BONGBONG MARCOS ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Even before Filipinos troop to the polling centers to cast their votes for President, a certain Rob Rances has already made a conclusion that Leni Robredo isn't going to win against BBM. Of course, Rob Rances defended his thesis statement with matching explanation to support what he thinks will be the outcome in the 2022 presidential election. Basically, Rances blamed Leni's camp downfall is their excessive holier-than-thou campaign approaches. According to him, such absurd sense of moral superiority is a turnoff. He believe many Filipinos will tend to agree with him. Rances wrapped up his FB post by serving the best part of his argument why Leni Robredo won't win because her camp blew an opportunity to genuinely empathize with the social and economic sentiments of the masa to gain their trust. Instead, the Leni campaign team treated the masa like Indios in their attempt to preach about history, credentials and platforms. In other words, they go out and act like they know better than the masa because they graduated from elite and top schools in the Philippines that is why we need to listen to them kind of attitude. As of this writing, Rob Rances FB post has generated 15,000+ reactions, 126 comments and 8,000+ shares in just 48 hours and counting. You may now read Rob Rances original FB post below. I think one of the reasons why Leni won't win this election is her camp's excessive use of holier-than-thou campaign approaches. Rances remarked that Leni's slogans only appeal to people who seek validation by association. I'm neither for BBM nor for Leni, but I find it repulsive when I read- ""Nagsisimba pero ang iboboto magnanakaw."" ""Dito tayo kung saan matatalino ang bomoboto."" ""Kampo ng mga magaganda at edukado, eh kayo?"" ""Huwag maging bobo, si Leni. ang iboto."" etc. I think such slogans are only appealing to those who seek validation by association. But for me, this absurd sense of moral superiority is a turnoff. Perhaps this is also how most people feel about these campaign messages from Leni's camp which is why they can't win enough undecided voters like me to support their candidate. There's so much incoherence between the image they paint about their candidate (a saint) and their campaign tactics (mostly pharisaic). But the Filipino masa had enough of this self-righteousness from pharisaic elites. Leni's camp missed to genuinely empathize with the social and emotional sentiments of the masa to gain their trust. Instead, they treated them like indios in their attempt to preach about history, credentials and platforms. They proselytize the undecided, leaving the impression ""you have to listen to us coz we know better"". Until they realize that their sense of moral superiority is a bit much, gaining trust through empathy is impossible. This holier-than-thou campaign approach is amiss, this is why I think Leni has lost her chance in this election. ",1

A girl's voice can be overheard exclaiming, ""nakakatakot"" on the sight she witnessed from the Kakampinks. The religious procession of the Kakampinks has elicited mixed reactions from netizens, mostly negative against Leni Robredo. One netizen commented that the video was taken during a torch rally Guagua Pampanga in the guise of praying for a peaceful election. Torch rally in Guagua, Pampanga. To pray for peaceful election and syempre to pray para manalo yung bet nilang candidate. Symbolism yung pa ilaw tsaka gabi na.

Pinoy Trending News,"A response of a netizen named L.Y. Moreno to the question posted somewhere in the internet in 2018, ""Why is it no one supports Vice President Leni Robredo in the Philippines?"" has gone viral lately after Jan Writer reposted it on his FB page. LY. Moreno began his answer by giving outsiders looking in a background of Filipino culture and that is Filipinos hate politicians who are ""pakitang tao"" or hypocrites. Moreno said President Duterte isn't hypocrite that is why Filipinos loves Duterte and hates Leni Robredo because she is a hypocrite. Moreno continued that the Liberal Party is the epitome of pakitang tao in Philipppine politics. Leni Robredo, being the Liberal Party's standard bearer though is she running as independent in the 2022 presidential polls, becomes the personification of the Liberal party. Moreno circled in Leni Robredo's speeches which he said almost all are pretty generic and sanitized. Even when she's interviewed by the media, he hold the opinion that Leni Robredo lacks intellectual spontaneity. not even say 25% of Senator Santiago's level. Moreno came in full circle and talked again about President Duterte's political acute image which he said exudes a character of frank crassness and vulgarity but with an honest heart. This Moreno said is the complete opposite of Leni Robredo who tries to project an image of convent-like Godliness, decency, prim and proper only to end up on the Filipinos as a hypocrite and dumb. LY. Moreno's brutally honest assessment of Leni Robredo resonated with Jan Writer's FB followers, generating 5,300+ reactions, 233 comments and 1,000+ shares in just 10 hours and counting. Here are some of the positive reactions of netizens to L.Y. Moreno's frank assessment of Leni Robredo's character. One netizen praised Moreno for hitting the nail right on its head. Damn, this guy really nailed it tight! Yeahhh!!!! A second wrote: Ouch. a stinging repudiation of the Dilawan Mentality. A third said that Moreno was a bit generous in saying Leni is 25% of Senator Miriam Santiago's level. Just saying ""not even 25% of former Sen. Santiago's level"" is a bit generous. A fourth laughed his ass off in regard to Moreno's description of Leni lacking intellectual spontaneity. Intellectual spontaneity - ang bigat! Hahaha In fairness to Leni Robredo, it is partly false to say that no one supports Leni Robredo because if using the latest poll surveys as gauge, Leni Robredo has managed to get 20-24% of the support of Filipinos. [Reuters] No matter how you look at it, 20-24% in poll surveys tell us Leni Robredo has the support of Filipinos. But is it enough to carry her to victory in May 9 election? Let us wait until the result of the election comes out. For now, let us take this as just another opinion of one of the VP's critics. However, when compared to President Duterte's numbers when using the latest approval and trust ratings as a basis of comparison between two of the highest leaders in the country today, Leni's numbers pale in comparison.

Pinoy Trending News,"Just a few days before Filipinos troop to the polling centers to elect their new sets of leaders, the supporters of Leni are now taking a leaf from LP's book of dirty tactics in the hope of changing the minds of pro-BBM who are working in the call center industry or who have family members employed in the industry to vote Leni instead. According to a Twitter netizen, her cousin went home from work and crying and told them to vote Leni because their head in the US warned them that if BBM wins, that their company will pull out of the Philippines and they will lose their jobs. Now, they are all converted to Leni, including their neighbors. Moving forward, Krizette Chu of Manila Bulletin recalled that this tactic has been employed in 2016 by LP supporters. They said that if Duterte wins, we will lose the respect of the world, foreign aid will be cut off, Filipinos will not be respected in the international community blah, blah. And Mar is the father of the BPO, so we needed to vote Mar. In other words, a Duterte presidency will destroy investor confidence. But 6 years after they said that line to frighten Pinoys from voting Duterte, how does the Philippines like now and before when LP was king in the Philippines? Chu said the Dilawans are always the doom and gloom. They thought it is that easy to close and industry.

Relativo argued that Leni-Kiko rallies attracted large crowds because of celebrity guests but when Leni started talking, he noted dead air... He said when Leni talked, the hype quickly died down. He urged Leni to keep reading, a swipe at Leni caught reading a teleprompter while delivering her campaign speeches. Relativo said that since Leni is a ""lawyer and economist"", hard to believe, he forced himself to listen to Leni talk. But in the end, Relativo realized that there are more important things he should spend his time and that is not Leni. Relativo added that Leni can't even handle casual interviews. How much more during ambush interviews and the questions come in rapid succession, she will tell the interviewer to repeat the question because she did not quite get it. Relativo said if it so happened Leni becomes president, the Philippines will experience education gap. He is not saying this to Leni because he is intelligent but rather he has a very sensitive ears when it comes to Logic and eloquence.

Pinoy Trending News,"The ""lady vendor"" who starred in the Jillian Robredo viral video in Baguio City Public Market turned out to be a guy and has gone public to air his side on the story. The netizen who allegedly heckled Jillian Robredo was forced to come out in the open because of what he called fake news peddled by News5. According to Cliff Lewis, the group of Jillian Robredo blocked the path of the public market. Lewis recalled so many people were in a rush, and that included him. They pleaded to Jillian Robredo's group to make way for them but to their chagrin, their pleas were ignored. Lewis clarified that he did not see Leni Robredo's daughter Jillian Robredo and did not have a confrontation with Jillian Robredo contrary to News5 claim. Lewis said that he had a verbal exchange with one of Jillian Robredo's entourage in the Baguio City Public market. Lewis narrated that the shouting matching started when he asked the Robredo supporter to let him pass the blocked path. Here's the exact words of Lewis to the Robredo supporter and the reply that apparently triggered him to answer back in a not so nice way. ""Noong sinabi ko po na 'excuse po, padaan po kasi nagmamadali ako' ang sagot sakin ay 'wala akong pakialam, ang importante ay iboto mo si Leni."""" So Lewis shouted back: Ay ganun po ba. Di pa nanalo si Madam Leni, naging diktatorya na kayo. Bintang kayo ng bintang ng diktatorya, hindi pala, kayo ang diktatorya. At this juncture, another Leni supporter, a lady in her 50s accompanied by two policemen, approached them and pointed her fingers at him. Lewis told the 50ish woman not to make duro-duro (point finger in a aggressive manner) because he is a an Igorot while you are a visitor in the city. Lewis said the verbal exchange was abruptly cut short because the two policemen intervened. Lewis remarked that he would not have reacted that way if the Leni supporters were not rude and just let left them go about their business. Lewis said an apology statement is not in order there was nothing to apologize. He believed he was just making a stand of he thinks is right. Lewis called out News5, calling them liars for splicing the video and make it appear he shouted at Jillian Robredo which he strongly denied. ",1

Takot ma cancel si Magalong ng mga kakamputz, baka kasi wala nang kakampwetz na dadayo sa Baguio, mawalan sila ng kita sa turismo.

Make sure yung nanigaw mag issue ng statement. Yung tinapunan ng fliers ang mukha ni BBM ng isang giant na Kakampota ok lang yun. Di na need pansinin. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, Mo Twister slammed BBM for refusing to go on debates because he's never been to a job interview. Never been to a job interview. Never been an employee. Never been an employer. Never had to answer to anyone except to his dictator father. Why would BBM go to a job interview for our country? Mo Twister asked. Of course, BBM has a good number of socmed influencers like the FB page the Luminous cannot just give Mo Twister a free pass to attack BBM without getting an adverse reaction. Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous wasted no time in correcting Mo Twister who said BBM did not experience getting employed because before he ran for President, he was former Vice Governor, a congressman and then senator. Atty. Ahmed asked what Mo Twister mean. He said it appears to him Mo Twister does not seem to know what is meaning of his own statement. In other words, Mo Twister is completely out of touch with reality. Atty Ahmed asked of Mo Twister is suffering from a malady called Marcos allergy or crunch time anxiety. Atty. Ahmed advised Mo Twister to simply scratch his allergy and he will get instant relief. Atty. Ahmed's rebuttal to Mo Twister's tweet against BBM generated 5,100+ reactions, 1,000 comments and 128 shares in just 9 hours and counting. You may now read Atty. Ahmed's original FB post below. Hala. He was vice governor. He was congressman. He was senator. What does this dude mean? He doesn't seem to know the meaning of his own statement. He's completely dissociated from reality. Is this Marcos Allergy or Crunch time Anxiety? Kamutin nyo lang yan, solb na yan. Nag-i-iningles pa kasi. Baka-sakaling may ma-impress at magpapaniwala sa kanya.

Pinoy Trending News,"So a video on Tiktok showing Jim Paredes and fellow Leni Robredo supporters taking their act to a busy street somewhere in Metro Manila has reached the attention of Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu. Chu quickly reposted the Tiktok video of Jim Paredes' street performance together with his fellow Leni Robredo supporters to give her personal take on the matter. Chu began by telling Jim and company, apparently campaigning for Leni Robredo, that generally Filipinos don't like ""bida-bidang"" classmates in the school who always volunteer to perform. These are your classmates who think that when they have presentation in school but their classmates are shooting each other annoyed looks. Chu said these are the kind of classmates whose performances are only like by their mothers but the classmates hate it. Chu described Jim Paredes' street performance in Waray: ""PARAYAWNUN"" ""MASUMO!"" So I checked Google and according to one website, PARAYWNUN is pasikat or showy and MASUMO is nakakaumay in Tagalog and boring or sickening in English. Another statement of Krizette using a combo of English and Waray sent me again to Google and I guess ""too much parayaw no likes to dayaw"" means too showy and no one likes to praise or make a favorable comment. Chu said that performances like those performed by Jim and company are unappreciated generally by Filipinos. She urged netizens to just look at the passersby very closely and see what she meant. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Just an advice, nothing personal: Most Filipinos don't really like the bida-bidang classmates sa school na laging performance level ang ganap. Yung Akala nila tuwang tuwa yung mga tao sa classroom pag meron silang presentation, but their classmates are shooting each other annoyed looks. Yung Akala nila they're doing the school a favor by volunteering to perform. Yung mga classmate mong mga nanay nyo lang ang natutuwa pero kayo hindi. I don't know the Tagalog word but in Waray it's called ""PARAYAWNUN."" MASUMO! Too much parayaw no one likes to dayaw These performances are unappreciated by most. Tignan nyo kayo kayo lang nanonood sa sarili nyo. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"If we hear someone says he/she is an alumni or alumna of the University of the Philippines, we always think of them as biased towards Leni or an anti-Duterte. But this UP alumna is one those former students who are not swayed by the anti-Duterte rhetoric of fellow UP alums. In a Facebook post that has already gone viral, generating 12,000+ shares and a few comments, UP alumna named Charmavirlou A. Armonia confessed she is anyone but Leni. Based on the tone of her voice, this UP alumna is a Duterte supporter and Leni Robredo having been Duterte admin's harshest critic for the last 6 years, she can't help but disdain Robredo's guts for criticizing PRRD and his administration almost every single day. She lamented that while PRRD has painstakingly carry the country on his shoulder, Leni has kept herself busy carrying herself and her color selfishly as well. In other words, Leni was a big liability of the Duterte admin instead of being an asset, contrary to her claims. According to Charmavirlou, if Leni's performance in the last 6 years as VP is a prelude to the kind of leadership she will be bringing to the table, she would rather have anyone but Leni. You may now read Charmavirlou Armonia's original FB post below. Why I will not vote for Leni? While PRRD has painstakingly carried the country on his shoulder, Leni has been busy carrying herself and her color selfishly as well. She has not been a real pillar of support to the President, and contrary to claims, she is not an asset but a big liability. Not a day goes by without her criticizing the government and PRRD. Worst, she would rather compete and take the spotlight and assumes she is better than the President. If her performance as the Vice-President of the Philippines for almost 6 years is a prelude to the kind of Leadership she will be bringing to the table, then, no thank you. I would rather have ANYONE BUT LENI. No amount of artista endorsements, commercials, sweet talks, rallies, and speeches can change my mind. GURL, MAJORITY KNOWS WHAT YOU DID IN THE LAST 6 YEARS. WE DON'T FORGET. Never to YellowPinks again. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The 2022 presidential election, if retired broadcaster Jay Sonza is correct, is not only a battle between BBM vs Leni but also a battle of endorsers. In a Facebook post entitled ""ENDORSEMENTS"", Sonza made a list who are the people/groups/celebs supporting Leni Robredo's presidential bid versus BBM. If you take a closer look, Leni's endorsers are big names in local showbiz industry while BBM are local political leaders in the country. If I may add, whoever wins in the 2022 presidential election will determine the fate of the endorsers. If Leni wins, it's also a win for her celeb endorsers because it means they can make or break a candidate. Product endorsements and projects are not far behind because they can use Leni's victory as proof of their drawing power. Otherwise, they will lose face and potentially endorsement deals in the next election because their collective star power are no match to the political machinery of local leaders. If BBM wins, the Liberal Party will definitely go back to the drawing board to reassess their campaign strategies in the future like making a decision whether to continue having celebrities as endorsers or not. Worth pointing out that while Leni has celebrity endorsers, BBM has also celebrity endorsers but not as many as Leni. In addition, Leni also has the support of local politicians but not as many as BBM. As of this writing, Sonza's post has gone viral, generating 23,800+ reactions, 1,700 comments and 2,300 shares in more than 24 hours and counting. Here are some of the comments from netizens. One netizen commented that Sonza's post is incomplete so he suggested additional information to Leni's List of endorsers. Kulang Yan... sir jay.. Leni endorsed by angel. pia... Catriona..

Kris a.. izza calzado... heart evangelista... vice Ganda... Kim chui.. true faith.. Ely buendia.. John arcilla...Ben and Ben. While on the other side #BBMSARA2022 is supported/endorsed by ordinary Filipinos and majority of ofws whose only weapons against these famous and influential stars are their precious VOTES.. A Robredo supporter did not like Sonza omitting some important information with regards to the kind of people endorsing Leni and BBM. You can compare all you want. But you cannot deny that Leni Robredo is endorsed by the Filipino people in all walks of life (educators, lawyers, artists, farmers, fishermen to name a few). While your idol is endorsed by corrupt politicians who had records of stealing from country's funds (Estrada, Revilla, Imelda, Enrile to name a few). #LetLeniLead#Leni Robredo#LeniKiko2022#lpanaloNa10to You may now read Sonza's FB post below.

Pinoy Trending News,"A Facebook page named The Taray Chronicles has, in my opinion, answered the $1-million question that is burning in the minds of the Kakampinks why BBM is a shoo-in to win the presidential election in May 2022 for consistently leading all national surveys, even before he filed his certificate of candidacy. BBM never relinquished this lead just 2 weeks before election day. Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza reposted the article of The Taray Chronicles on his FB page, easily garnering 15,800+ reactions, 1,200 comments and 3,200 shares in just 24 hours and counting. Basically, the writer said that he choose BBM over Leni, Manny and Isko because he is not dumb. He said he may not be intelligent like the Leni supporters or those who have been calling BBM supporters TANGA, BOBO and GAGO since we elected Duterte in 2016, but the he is not as dumb like the Leni supporters who would rather choose a PUPPET to lead the country because of hatred of the Marcoses. You may now read the original article below. WHY BBM? WHY NOT LENI? (OR ISKO? OR MANNY?) Because I am not DUMB. I may not be matalino like you, you, or you who have been calling us TANGA BOBO and GAGO since we elected a BARDAGUL into the presidency in 2016, but I am not as BoBoMo as you who would rather choose a PUPPET to lead this country due to hatred towards Marcos. Hate is the absence of reason, and rational thinking goes out the window when vested interest walks in. Don't tell me it is due to patriotism, love of country and all that crap. You call prohibiting the Philippine flag in rallies a patriotic gesture? Don't tell me she has a mind of her own. Why would she allow herself to shamelessly suit up and do stuff fit for a tin man getting lost in a merry-go-round? As the adorable little girl admonishing her parents and wagging a finger for teasing her ""Leni kami, Leni kami"" would say - ""No, no, no! B-B-M."" Tykes know better than adults sometimes. Why BBM? Because despite what the haters, detractors, black propagandists, bashers, trolls and the mindless say about him over and over like they only live for it - he is a decent human being, just like you and me, without the blinders. Just take a look at the family he has raised and nurtured. Do they look anything like the Addams Family? He may not be as brilliant and as visionary as his father ever was, but he has the Marcos genes nonetheless and he will steer the country based on the road map that Marcos Sr. started and President Duterte has wisely picked up. He is well-rounded and widely-read like his sister the senator. Machiavelli? Sun Tzu? Hawking? Black holes? Quantum physics? Geopolitics? Try watching his old fast-talk videos, you'd be surprised how well versed he is on a range of topics that we average humans have only a tiny bit of understanding. You judge him for his ""past""? Let me ask you - are you the same person today as you were in your youth? No, because you grew up, you learned about things, you experienced life's ups and downs, you threw away the bad links and moved on to make something of yourself. So why sit in judgment over another person's ""history""? Don't you have your own baggage to strut around? Why have the Loyalists stayed with the Marcoses through the years? Many have grown old, but they still carry the torch, so to speak. Passed on to their brood who are only too happy to oblige. That is a conundrum only they can answer, and which every other political dynasty would wish they have. The words that you rattle off to destroy his character? Might boomerang on you, careful, careful. A person who takes all the slings and arrows directed at him without a whimper is not a sign of weakness at all. There is a Biblical explanation to that, and ye decent, self-righteous people even have a prayer for it. Right? So, why BBM? Because I believe in what he and Inday Sara are offering to the Filipino people. UNITY. CONTINUITY. PRIDE OF RACE. Why not Leni? Or Isko? Or Manny? Because I am not dumb. And i wouldn't have my Motherland run like hell and fed to the beasts by a SIMPLETON. The TARAY Chronicles ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"According to the Inquirer news article, the supporters of Leni Robredo still insisted that Google Trends points towards a Leni victory, a complete opposite of what the surveys said that Leni will lose to BBM in the May 9 presidential derby. In that regard, social media influencer and staunch Duterte supporter MJ Quiambao Reyes took to Facebook to rain on the parade of Leni supporters who are insisting Google Trends is pointing towards a Leni victory just because Leni is the most searched presidential candidate on Google.

She went on to start a survey to debunk Leni supporters who think Google Trends is good indicator of Leni victory in presidential polls. She gave her followers 5 options.

Pinoy Trending News,"Uh-oh! It seems like theme of the Leni-Kiko campaign rally to be held in Tondo Manila has rubbed off on many people the wrong way, including Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu. How? Well, the Leni-Kiko tandem rally to be held in Tondo Manila was the the obvious culprit. Chu went on to recall the theme of the Leni-Kiko campaign rally in Pasig and Cebu as basis of comparison versus the theme ""TONDO: SA PILING NG LAYLAYAN"" of the Leni-Kiko tandem in Tondo for emphasis. Chu asked if we say Tondo, automatically are they laylayan or the poorest of the poor? Chu remarked that a house in Tondo is expensive because the real estate value is high. Chu asked why the Leni-Kiko camp did not use the same theme as Tondo since many Leytenos are very poor? Chu suggested that perhaps the Leni-Kiko camp could have use another theme since they like stereotyping. For example, ""ITODO SA TONDO: SA PILING NG MGA MATON!""

Pinoy Trending News,"Compared to the massive BBM-Sara campaign rally in Cebu recently wherein an estimated 300,000 people attended, the Leni-Kiko Ceboom 2.0 rally yesterday was a huge letdown for the Leni camp, crowd wise. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu put forward her own theory in a latest Facebook post to explain the failure of the Leni-Kiko camp to top the crowd of the BBM-Sara Cebu rally. Basically, Chu said Cebuanos aren't easily impressed with celebrities hence the low turnout of the crowd. As in Cebuanos won't go the extra mile just to listen a band or see a celebrity, Chu added. In other words, the huge come-on of Leni-Kiko rallies are the free concert and celebrities didn't excite the Cebuanos. That's explain the dismal crowd who went to listen to Leni-Kiko campaign pitches, Chu remarked. In the wake of the massive BBM-Sara rally, Chu stated, this is the so-called dagger in the heart of LP. Chu ended the FB post with the conclusion that the failure of Leni-Kiko to win the hearts of the Cebuanos is the final gavel of judgment. As some political analyst say, you didn't win Cebu, you cannot claim Cebu. Ergo, Cebu isn't pink. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post below. I think one of the bigger reasons konti lang ang tao sa Cebu rally ni Leni-Kiko is hindi mabilis ma impress sa artista ang mga Cebuano. As in they won't go great lengths just to hear a band or see a celebrity. So a big part of the come-on of Leni's rallies-the concert and the celebrities-didn't appeal to the Cebuanos. So ayan 50k at most lang daw sabi ng police. Ilan pa dyan yung galing Manila at ilan pinilit daw ng schools as per leaked memos. In the heels of the massive Bbm-Sara rally, this is a knife in the heart of LP. Maybe it is the final gavel of judgement. You didn't win Cebu. You cannot claim Cebu. Cebu isn't pink. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the latest rebranding of Leni Robredo, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza took to Facebook to share his opinion on the matter. According to Sonza, Leni's problem is not branding per se but the product itself - Leni. Sonza said Leni is the problem because people refuses to patronize Leni the product. No matter how many times they change the packaging but the product is defective, smells bad and does not pass the strict scrutiny of the discriminating taste buds of the consumers, there is no chance the product will sell. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. One netizen wrote that a chicken dung wrapped in any exquisite packaging would still smell like chicken dung. True. Chicken dung, wrapped in any exquisite paper or cloth, would still smell like chicken dung. Nobody would buy it. No matter what color Leni wears, she will still be the Dilawan that she is. Kahit anong kulay pa isuot niya, magpalit man siya araw araw, ang buto, laman at budhi dilaw pa rin. Ang isinisigaw araw araw, hindi na nagbago, mga sigaw din ng panginoon nilang korikong aquino! Another said Leni is expired product so naturally consumers will avoid her. Paano kasi Sir Jay expired na ang produkto. Ginawa na ngang ""new and improved"" ang pakete waley parin. Pero benta pa rin ng benta kahit halata namang sukang suka na ang madlang people! Akala yata ng mga campaign managers ni lenlen natutulog at humihilik pa rin ang mga tao. Gising na gising na kaya! This netizen said that no matter what brand Leni is, since she has no mind or stance on her own, she will hardly convince people to follow her. true, khit anong brand pa yan, wala kcing sariling paninindigan, di tlg mkaenganyo,walang bahid kasalanan daw, aba di yan tao sobrang linis eh, yung dasal nga ng mahal na birhen ginamiit wala pa din naniwala sa kaululan nila, na solid BBM You may now read Jay Sonza's brief FB post below. The problem is not branding. There really is not a question of rebranding. Ang produktong ibinebenta ang problema. Ayaw bilhin ng tao ang produkto. Ayaw ng tao sa produkto. Wala sa pakete o pabalat ang suliranin. Ilang daang beses man tayong magpalit ng sisidlan, kung iyong produkto ay sira, masama ang lasa, masangsang ang amoy at hindi pasado sa maselan at mapanlait na panlasa, wala itong pag-asang mabenta talaga.

Pinoy Trending News,"On observations made by Isko and Ping that many are voting BBM because they angry of the Aquinos and the Liberal Party (Leni included), Direk Manny Castaneda said he definitely agree with the two gentlemen. Direk Castaneda said this is because the Filipinos felt deceived by the Liberal Party and the Aquinos. The veteran director remarked that Filipinos want BBM to become President to slap the faces of the Aquinos, so strong, even more intense than what Will Smith did to Chris Rock, so intense that it will dislodge Kris' jaw? That's how angry Filipinos of the Aquinos said Castaneda. Castaneda concluded his very brief FB post saying that like many Filipinos are who voting BBM, he wants to slap Aquinos. If possible, more than a slap. Here are some of the comments of netizens in reaction to Direk Manny's observation. Netizen #1 said it is more than hatred of the Aquinos and LP they are voting BBM. They can see continuity of PRRD's projects in BBM. actually more than hatred sa LP.its because the success of duterte admin..nakita naman natin na si BBM lang ang aligned sa policy of this current admin..lalo Duterte has the highest approval rate Netizen #2 agreed with Direk Manny's observation. True direk! Kaya po ako bbm - sara, because it is a protest vote against the Aquinos na nalinlang ako nang matagal na panahon. Im a Duterte supporter and Sara supports Bbm Netizen #3 asked in jest with regards to the starting point of the queue. Direk, saan ang umpisa ng pila? Sigurado box office hit ang pila ng gusto sumampal at tumadyak sa mga hudas na yan❤❤❤ You may read Direk Manny's FB post below. I definitely agree with the observations of Isko Moreno and Ping Lacson, maraming boboto kay BBM dala lamang ng kanilang galit sa mga Aquino at sa buong Liberal Party, damay na doon syempre si Leni Robredo. Ito ay dahil sa mga panlilinlang na kanilang ginawa at ginagawa sa taongbayan. Gusto nilang maging presidente si Bongbong Marcos para sampalin ang mga Aquino, isang matinding sampal na mas malakas pa sa ginawa ni Wil Smith kay Chris Rock, yung klase ng sampal na siguradong matatanggal ang panga ni Kris. Ganun po katindi ang kanilang galit. At aaminin ko, isa po ako dun sa gustong sumampal sa mga Aquino. Kung pwedeng tadyak, mas maigi. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Political science teacher named Jan Writer stated in his latest Facebook post that the Kakampinks' infatuation with the Balagtasan style of speaking or writing is the very reason why they cannot win elections again. Jan Writer shared the screenshot of Leni Robredo's Easter Sunday message to his FB followers to give them an idea what he was talking about. Jan Writer even lifted 2 phrases in Leni's Easter message that caught his attention and used it in the intro for emphasis. Jan Writer said the Kakampinks think they are above everyone else and God's chosen ones. He urged his followers to take note how Duterte talks and even BBM. He said both speak devoid drama and direct to the point. They don't talk like they are in a Balagtasan or poetic joust. You may read Jan Writer's brief FB post below.

Here are some of the comments of netizens. Netizen #1 said she welcomed politicians who talk with emotions but only if it is sincere and comes from the heart. But unfortunately, Leni does not speak with sincerity, the netizen said. It's good to have an appeal to the emotion because Filipinos are emotional. But only if it is sincere and coming from the heart. Problem is... when she delivers the message I don't know why it does not connect. It easily melts under the sun. In other words, alam nyo na.❤ Netizen #2 found the Pinklawans OA (overacting) which irritates him. Ang OA ng mga pinklawans eh.. daming drama sa buhay akala nmam nila naniniwala pa mga tao sa kanila.. eh sa totoo lang nakakainis pakknggan... May kiko pang paiyakiyak ampoooch.. Netizen #3 said it best to describe the Pinklawans/Dilawans. They really believe that they are more enlightened, more erudite, and really, just ""Angat"". They have even taken a more condescending (masquerading as radical na pagmamahal) ""kinaawaan kita"" perspective towards the poor, whom they deem as uncouth and whom they automatically assume to be BBM supporters.

Pinoy Trending News,"Not the best time to be a Leni supporter right now. According to Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu in her latest FB post, Leni Robredo's presidential bid is doomed now after the joint presser of Isko, Ping and Norberto yesterday. But before we talk about the bad news, Chu thinks Leni supporters are not expected to abandon her and vote another candidate because Ping ang Isko claimed Leni tried to bribe them and in exchange, they will drop their respective presidential bids. Why? Because Leni supporters are heavily invested in Leni. In addition, they are embarrassed to admit that the allegations hurt them. Chu noted that not anyone from the Robredo camp bothered to issue a statement denying the bribery allegation vs Leni. That's the good news on Leni's part. No one is jumping ship. The bad news is, the neutrals will have now on more reason to vote another candidate. In addition, Chu predicted Leni will not gain new voters because they have one more reason not to pick her. Meaning? Her rating will not go up anymore. If Leni will not back out from the race as Isko suggested, BBM will be the main beneficiary of the Sunday presser. No Leni supporter will change her mind about Leni despite the revelations. They're already in too deep. Nakakapahiya yung mga sinabi ng mga kandidato like Ping, Gonzales, Isko, Manny. Masakit sa pride aminin nila na yung Nanay nila nang ba bribe ng ibang candidates. Ni Hindi kaya I deny ng tahasan na wala sinuman galing sa camp nila ang nag offer. The neutrals however will have one more reason not to pick Leni. Leni will no longer gain new followers and her ratings will not go up. If she will not withdraw, like they're asking her to, BBM will even have more followers and supporters. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The presscon drama of the 3 presidential candidates at the Manila Pen yesterday has been mocked, vilified and what not by the supporters of Leni camp on Twitter because they accused Leni of asking to them withdraw from the race and unite behind her own presidential bid. Of course, the Leni camp, led by the OVP Spox Atty. Barry Gutierrez brushed aside this allegation, calling it falsehoods and pure theatrics of the other presidential bets who are way below Leni in the surveys. Moving forward, Atty. Bruce Rivera read on the joint presscon of Pink, Isko and Norberto is the simplest yet most on point analysis of the message of Ping, Isko and other presidential candidates want to convey to the public yesterday in Manila Pen with regards to Leni Robredo. According to Atty. Bruce, the joint presscon at the Manila Pen was a strong rebuke to Leni Robredo's character as a leader. You may now read Atty. Bruce's original FB post below. BOTTOMLINE Uulitin ko. Elections are about ability to lead and ability to win. You can be the most qualified but if you have no chance of winning, masasayang ang boto. You can be winnable but you lack the ability to lead. Ping, Isko, Manny called on Leni to respect their candidacy because sinasabi ni Leni na wala silang ability to win kaya dapat umatras sila. In effect, sinasabi naman ni Isko, Ping at Manny kay Leni na the ability to lead include the ability to respect any opponent how small or insignificant he or she may be. Being a leader is not winning at all cost but rising in spite of all the adversity. Many are saying the five man presscon was an attack on Leni's winnability. And that is partly true. But what is most apparent is that it is a rebuke on her character as a leader. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Three weeks before election and a few hours after the Manila Pen joint-presscon of Kiko, Ping and Gonzalez, Leni-Kiko team decided to change the color of their rose from pink to the Philippine flag plus the colors pink and green to symbolize unity of all political colors of the candidates. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu called this exercise a desperate, last ditch effort to claw they way back to relevancy to a bigger and wider audience. In other words, another PR stunt in the hope of salvaging an unsalvageable campaign to thrust Leni Robredo to the presidency. Basically, Chu told Leni camp to raise the white flag now because it is over. Three weeks before election, Leni's very brilliant campaign team changes the colors of their rose to the colors of the PH flag (plus a stray pink and green leaf.) three weeks before elections, a desperate, last ditch, clawing for air attempt to make themselves relevant to a bigger audience. Too little, too late Netizens seem to agree with Krizette Chu's on point read of Leni's presidential campaign as shown in the comments below. Netizen #1 called Leni-Kiko's campaign at this point hilarious. At this point, their campaign is beyond comical.. Netizen #2 blamed Leni-Kiko's political branding confusing for their crushing defeat in the forthcoming election. Too little, too late for VP's camp. If we are going to observe their rallies, sorties and caravans. The Philippine Flag is already associated with the UNITEAM, while the Pink Flag and roses are already analogous to Leni-Kiko. Sadly, the political branding of VP Leni is very inconsistent and confusing. From a Yellow Ribbon to a simple plain white color to Pink Roses and Flag/Banner this???00000000 Netizen #3 said many Filipinos just don't like Leni's personality. Plus, she has zero integrity. then She now has more colors than my favorite eyeshadow palette. Wala sa kulay yan, Leni. Nasa personality at integrity. We don't like your personality and we see that you have no integrity, so it's not gonna fly. Netizen #4 agreed with netizen #3 that the color is not the problem, it's Leni. The problem is not the color. It's the person that they are trying to sell. Yung product mismo ang hindi sellable. Trust ratings shows na wala ng wenta yung tao tapos ilalako pa nila. Ang diskarte pa was to change the initial color of the brand. Gawing pink yung dilaw. Tapos sabihin na independent at walang influences from the LP itself. Pero yunt campaign manager at yung VP eh true-blooded LP. Patawa lang eh. Yan yung typical na repackaging. Pero yun at yun pa rin ang lasa. LP should have just ditched her when they knew that their bet has a very low trust rating and that the result of the last election shows that she doesn't have the capacity to at least push one candidate in the Senate. That proves that she's not the right candidate for this Presidential election and should not be made the face of the opposition. LP will now be a has been, thanks to her. Better luck next time and please hire a new blood of campaign strategists. Also do consider the stats, for numbers don't lie.  ",1

Now I understand why support him, said the BBM critic. International Relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot did not let this swipe at her and BBM go unanswered. In a Facebook post, Sasot easily demolished the attempt of the BBM critic to paint him as high maintenance if he becomes President because he is the type of person who is used to living the high life unlike the Dutch PM who leads a frugal life. In other words, the Dutch PM is simple while BBM is the complete opposite. Here are some of the comments of netizens defending BBM as shown below. Netizen #1 has no qualms BBM not taking economy class when he flies abroad or to a local destination. So what? Even an ordinary people if you can afford to pay first class in flights, what's your problem! Big deal? Weird naman !!! Netizen #2 poke fun at the BBM critic who wants BBM to commute by bike to visit areas after a typhoon. Imagine biking to Leyte from Malacañang to tend to the flood victims. Oh wait... Netizen #3 chided the BBM critic for asking question without even knowing what he was about to ask.

Do you know how long it took the Netherlands to become what it is now - politically, economically, and nationally? At least 200 years. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu posted her take of the just concluded joint press conference held by the four presidential aspirants in a Makati hotel today. Basically, Chu is trying to tell the internet that what transpired today at the presscon in Makati should serve as a warning to us all what of leadership Leni will bring to the table, knock on wood, if elected as the country's next leader. Chu said that if Leni can't even convince other Presidential aspirants to forget their presidential ambitions and just support her own presidential bid to stop the Marcoses via BBM to return to Malacanang, she is a weak negotiator. Just the thought of this send shudders to Chu's spine how Leni would navigate the many international conflicts brewing in the horizon with the amateur political skills she has if she becomes president. More importantly, Chu said that Leni's epic failure to unite the Opposition does tells us one thing - Leni can't lead. Worse, she even made the other presidential aspirants unite against her. That says a lot of Leni's leadership skills, argued Chu. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. She tried to unite all against BBM. She failed. Not only did she fail, they then turned around and exposed her for trying to make them back out. As Sen Ping reveals, a generous offer was even put on the table. Leni can't lead. Leni CAN'T LEAD. Leni doesn't know how to negotiate. She's the VP and they're ""just"" Senators and Mayors. How can she negotiate with other leaders of other countries if she can't even talk to people under her? How can she negotiate with terrorists? With businessmen? With equal branches of the government like the SC justice and the HoR? How can she navigate the many international conflicts brewing in the horizon with the kind of amateur political skills she has? Hindi enough mamigay ng spaghetti. Hindi enough ang mauna sa natural disaster stricken areas ng walang dala. Hindi enough yon. And also SHAME. Shame on making this election all about two candidates, a battle of good and evil. Shame on disrespecting the freedom of the millions of people who don't want her. Sige na LP, try to deny what everybody there claimed. GIVE US A DECENT SECOND PLACER, A BETTER RUNNER UP! Give us anyone else to fight against BBM but Leni!!!! As Norberto Gonzales who is 1 billion times worthier to be President than Leni says, ""Maghanap tayo ng bagong number 2."" !!!!!! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A meme being passed around on Twitter by Kakampinks saying Google Trends predicted Leni Robredo's victory over consistent survey leader BBM has been met with laughter by BBM supporters, including TraveLife Magazine punlisher Christine Cunanan. I did a quick search on Twitter and even known performing artist like Audie Gemora falls for this PR stunt. Cunanan found it ludicrous that the Kakampink supporters would be so stupid to think that Leni Robredo making it to Google Trends top searches is an indicator of her victory in the forthcoming presidential election. Cunanan argued that if she google Leni Robredo 1000 times, looking for newest bloopers just for laughs does not mean she is voting Leni Robredo in the election.

Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, Lingayen Archbishop Soc Villegas' Holy Week message was basically to warned the public to be wary of ""UNITY"" based on money, power blah, blah saying that virtuous unity must be based on humility, apparently a swipe at the message of unity of the BBM-Sara tandem. In that regard, Mayor Sara Duterte's friend and San Beda College of Law classmate Atty. Bruce Rivera can't help but comment on Archbishop Soc Villegas' Holy Week message to the Catholics because according to him, the Ligayen-Archbishop' assertion is flawed for three reasons. Right off the bat, Atty. Bruce told Soc that unity is an act of State which is an Act of God. Remember the Vox Populi, vox dei saying? The voice of the people is the voice of God? The question is, when do you show unity? According to Atty. Bruce, unity is manifested when Pinoys go to the polling centers to elect new sets of leaders to lead this nation. Likewise, unity is also manifested by the voters of the losing candidate respecting the result of the election. As a Catholic leader, Atty. Bruce said that the humility of accepting a leader you do not vote is the valued unity Archbishop Soc should be preaching. Ouch! Next, Atty. Bruce rebuffed Archbishop Soc's statement that unity based on political power, money etc is not true unity. This is not entirely true said Atty. Bruce. To achieve unity, you need political power and money. Hence, Archbishop Soc is endorsing someone because he wants power. He could have chosen to stay neutral and not endorse a candidate to avoid dividing his flock but he chose the opposite because he wants to be influential. Influence is power. But that depends if the people listens to him. Otherwise, he will lose his credibility and his flock because of his sinful pride. As the bible says, money is the root of all evil and yet he is endorsing a candidate because he needs money. To gain power, you spend money. Archbishop's candidate spends money to win an election. This makes his candidate the very person he is alluding not to support. You may now read Atty. Bruce's original FB post below. BAKIT MALI SI SOC Hindi sana ako magagalit ng Biyernes Santo pero pag gumagalaw ang demonyo, kailangan mong sabihin na mali siya. MALI KA, BISHOP!!! Una, unity is an act of State which is an Act of God. Vox dei, vox populi. So when do you show unity? It is during elections when the whole nation elect its leaders. And unity is manifested when the one chosen by the most number of Filipinos lead this nation. But unity is also manifested by the voters of the losing candidate RESPECTING the results of that election. The humility of accepting a leader who is not your choice is the valued unity you should be preaching. Clearly, that is when true unity is achieved when you respect the choice of the people even when you have another candidate in mind. Practice what you preach. Huwag parinig using the pulpit because it reeks of hypocrisy like the Pharisees who conspired to cause the death of Jesus. Second, you need political power, money to achieve unity. The reason you are endorsing a candidate is you want power. You can stay neutral and not divide the already dwindling parishioners but you go out of your way to be on the good graces of politician? Why? Because you want to be influential. Influence is power. And you will only get influence if the people listen to you. And if they do not, you will lose the flock because of your own sinful pride. Your lust for power is sad and contemptuous. And money is the root of all evil but you need money. Everyone needs money. When you want power you spend money. Which makes whoever you are supporting the same person you are saying not to support. Third, when you call someone a criminal or attribute a criminal act, what is the duty of every Catholic? To love even the enemy, to forgive those who have sinned against us and to do not do unto others what you do not do unto you. God never required an apology from the person. All he said is forgive. That was the lesson from the two other criminals in the cross. What did the crucifixion teach us? It taught us that not all criminals we crucify are criminals because we crucified the Son of God So when we call someone a criminal or a sinner, we should condemn with Jesus in mind. So we act with justice. And if we can forgive child molesters and return them to the flock because the law never convicted the abuser, how can you convict with your words? Jesus is relevant even today because he is the epitome of the persecution of good and his death is vindication against hate and evil. Practice what you preach. ",1

Goodbye Eleazar. You may read below Carlo de Leon's original FB post. Eleazar, please lang. Wag mo sakyan ang fake news na yan. Akala ko pa naman hindi ka tanga. But I make mistakes. Hahaha. Kidding aside, you should ask Leni where the sex video is and what kind of harassment is she talking about. Leni and her minions were the first to see the video and then talked about it. And the so-called trending in social media came from no other but them. I don't see the harassment being done by Marcos. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, VP Leni Robredo accused BBM of masterminding the Aika video scandal to stop the momentum her campaign is gaining a month before the election. On that note, Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous invited Leni Robredo to produce evidence of the existence of such tape. Atty. Ahmed reasoned the Robredo cannot just assert the existence of something and then use it to accuse a rival candidate of wrongdoing. Atty. Ahmed said that as a lawyer, Robredo should know that he/she who makes a controversial claim bears the burden of proving it. Atty. Ahmed also mentioned that evidence in one's possession if suppressed is called adverse evidence. As a non-lawyer, I consult Google the meaning of adverse evidence. Google says adverse evidence is evidence that causes a disadvantage, evidence that serves the other side of a court case. Atty.

Did he film it? What did he do? The very fresh lawyers of yesterday's vintage would know that she, who makes a controversial claim, has the burden of proving it. They also know that evidence, when in one's possession, is suppressed, such evidence is adverse. Mrs. Robredo doesn't seem to know any of these things.

Meanwhile, a certain Carlo de Leon isn't amenable to the idea of Aika Robredo and the Kakampinks walking away after accusing BBM and his camp of masterminding the malicious video when the clamor to produce the evidence snowballed, they suddenly have cold feet and wants the public to move on. De Leon, in an emphatic tone, dared Aika and the Kakampinks to finish what they started by producing the video before we all move on. Hold on. Not so fast. Let me get this right. First, you bring up the issue of the alleged sex video; you accuse your opponent of fabricating lies and fake news.

Pinoy Trending News,"Leni Robredo is getting flak from netizens after a photo of the vice president purportedly signing her portrait owned by a supporter has been making the rounds online. Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes reposted the photo of the vice president on her wall saying Robredo must be very excited since she signed the portrait without giving much thought what she was getting into. Reyes asked if either Robredo forgot what she studied in law school or simply clueless that signing the portrait was inappropriate? If you take a closer look at the portrait, the presidential seal was very visible in the background of the seated Leni Robredo which was obviously photoshopped by the presumptuous supporter. This glaring error in the photo did not escape the eagled-eyed Reyes and her FB followers who cited the existence of the law that prohibits the use of the Presidential seal except the President. On Facebook, Reyes wrote: EXCITED MUCH SI MADAM Sign agad? Nakalimutan kaya or clueless lang na inappropriate yan? Here are some of comments from netizens below. Netizen #1 commented that based on what he saw, this is an attribute that he does not want for a leader. This goes to show, either she doesn't know the law or ignore it (Prohibiting the unauthorized use of the seal of the President of the Philippines). Either way, that's an attribute that I do not want for my leader. Netizen #2 can't help but recall a similar incident involving the grand daughter of President Duterte wherein critics of PRRD, including Rappler made it a huge issue at that time. noong nag-pre-debut sa malacanang ang apo ni PRD meron pang mention na EO si rappler... kumusta naman yung photoshopped pic ni FVP na may John Hancock pa niya??? Meanwhile, this netizen can't help but comment on Leni's confidence. Hala oi...counting the eggs before it is hatched... OMG Ang lakas ng confidence Meanwhile, this netizen said that this photo is proof that ambition and stupidity aren't the perfect match. Just goes to show that ambition and stupidity don't mix well.

Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, a campaign video from the Leni Robredo camp has been released recently, starring Piolo Pascual, saying there is ONLY one who have shown and signified true unity and that is none other than Leni Robredo. Pascual's campaign video claiming Leni is the only one who can unite the country elicited heavy criticism, especially from the camp of the Duterte supporters, including MJ Quiambao Reyes, a pro-Duterte social media influencer who has been defending the PRRD admin from critics in the last 6 years. Basically, Reyes said there if there is anyone who has galvanized, rallied the Filipino people into action, is is none other than his Lolo (grandpa) Digong. Reyes said matter-of-factly that PRRD managed to unify the Filipino people despite the left and right black propaganda from the Oligarchs via the mainstream media while building up the image of Leni Robredo at the same time. Reyes went on to reinforce her assertion that PRRD is the great unifier of the Filipino people by citing 4 major reasons why. You may now read MJ Reyes' FB post below. Habang UNITY ang pagsamo ng BBM-SARA, Sabi ni Piolo, isa lang daw ang nagpakita at nagparamdam ng totoong pagkakaisa, si Leni Robredo lang. Umayos ka nga, Papa P. Walang wala yang fuchsiang ina mo sa lolo ko! ✓ Walang ibang nakakuha ng 91% trust at satisfactory rating maliban kay PRRD. ✓ Hanggang sa huling mga araw nya sa Malacañang ay napakataas pa rin ng net satisfaction rating nya - habang ang Memang walang ginawa kundi kumontra +1 (neutral) na lang ang tiwalang nakuha nya. ✓ Noong nag tawag ng clean up ng Manila Bay, daan daang libong supporters ni PRRD ang tumugon. Look at Manila Bay and Boracay now. Patunay yan kung paano tayo nagkaisa dahil sa kanya. ✓ Siya rin ang bumuhay sa matagal ng natutulog na pagka makabayan ng napakaraming Filipinos abroad. Nagawa nya at napagkaisa nya ang mas nakararaming Filipino sa kabila ng kaliwa't kanang paninira ng mga oligarka thru lamestream media - the same lamestream media na panay ang build up kay Aling Mema.

ICYMI, Tricia Robredo has been doing the house to house campaign to convince BBM supporters to switch to her mother by showing her best behavior while explaining why Leni Robredo is deserving of their vote. In his tweet, @CuriousCuteGuy insulted the HongKong-based OFWs by saying that he expected BBM to get most of the votes there because they are poor and do not have degrees. This also explained why BBM is a huge hit among the poorest of the poor for those reasons. The condescending remark of the Kakampink supporter and Kabataan Partylist member elicited angry reactions from netizens. Some netizens welcomed the likes of @CuriousCuteGuy because they are best recruiters for BBM-Sara tandem. Netizen #1 called this Kakampink the best endorsers for BBM-Sara.

Pinoy Trending News,"A photo of Leni Robredo disembarking from a jeepney has been criticized by Jay Sonza because she was not doing it right? Sonza praised Leni Robredo because she is really great, in a sarcastic tone. He said Leni is an economist, a lawyer and now a jeepney driver. Moving forward, Sonza called Leni Robredo's attention because he noticed she was not doing it correctly. Sonza went on to explain that drivers embark and disembark his jeep using the passenger side. Sonza said that the spare tire at the driver's side has its purpose why it is there - driver's arm rest when tired or defense from the police's baton or from tube pipe when driver's riot was a trend back in the days. Sonza said that perhaps Leni was not informed regarding the history of the spare tire at the jeepney' driver side so he mentioned it. Sonza reiterated that Leni would be unable to disembark or embark using that side with her feet first. You may now read Sonza's original FB post below. Ang galing talaga ng BP Leni ano po. Ekonomista na, abogada pa, at drayber pa man din. Pero, madam., mali po iyon baba ninyo diyan. Kaming mga naging tsuper ng jeepney, sa kabila po ang sakay at baba. lyan pong reserbang gulong ay ginagamit po naming pahingahan kapag nagngalay ang kamay at iyong gulong depensa po iyan sa hatawan ng batuta ng lespu o tubo noong sinaunang panahon na uso pa ang rambol sa pagitan ng mga drayber. lyan po ang kasaysayan ng gulong sa tabi ng tsuper. Baka lang po hindi kayo nainform hinggil sa kuwento ng reserba sa side ng tsuper. Hindi po talaga kayo makakababa ng una ang dalawang paa. Pagsakay at baba po riyan ay pasalampak po dapat. Ingat po kayo, kasi pag ganyan ang baba nyo, malamang sa hindi maiipit po iyong ispikikay. As expected, Sonza's criticism of Leni for her ignorance regarding the proper way to disembark and embark to paly the role of jeepney driver did not make a lot of Leni supporters very happy. Pati pag baba sa jeep issue? Alam mo bang campaign shoot lang yan? Naniwala ka talagang si Leni nag drive? Stop spreading fake news! Ang tanda mo na di ka nga marunong mag fact check To which a Sonza follower replied: issue tlga pag may Doctorate ka pero engot ka.

Angeli's tweet did not make a lot of BBM supporters happy including radio host Mark Lopez who wasted no time in chiding Gab's mother via a Facebook post. Lopez began by asking his followers who are pro-admin and BBM if the Kakampinks are really this entitled? Lopez gave Angeli a tongue-lashing for letting her son get involved in politics when she is aware her son suffered from mental breakdown in the recent past and how toxic our political atmosphere is. Lopez said that Angeli should have warned her son to stay out of politics and the spotlight because its very toxic and he may be unable to handle the stress that comes with it. However since he made his choice, Lopez said Gab should man up and not hide from his illness. Lopez ended the FB post chiding Angeli Pangilinan Valenciano for playing the victim card.

Pinoy Trending News,"While the Robredo camp led by the OVP Spokesman Atty. Barry Gutierrez is filled with optimism that the 9% increase in Leni Robredo's rating in the latest Pulse Asia survey indicates what they called the turning of the tide, a dissertation put forward by a Robredo critic attempts to douse cold water to the jubilant mood of the Robredo camp. The dissertation of the Robredo critic stated that Leni Robredo is nothing without the anti-Marcos vote. The author Krizette Chu of Manila Bulletin explained that her dissertation will show why Leni's numbers can't breach the ceiling and why Marcos is a constant variable in her campaign. Basically, Chu said that Leni Robredo supporters aren't really pro-Leni but rather rabidly anti-Marcos and anti-Duterte. Chu's thesis statement are anchored on two things-first, observation. Second, numbers. With that said, Chu implied that Leni's chances of overhauling BBM's lead and scoring a come-from-behind victory is nil. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. ON HER OWN, WITHOUT THE ANTI-MARCOS VOTE, LENI ROBREDO IS NOTHING A dissertation on why Leni's numbers can't break the (very low) ceiling and why she really needs to keep mentioning Marcos in her campaign. Most of Leni's supporters aren't decidedly pro Leni, they're rabidly anti Marcos. Which is why she has a low ceiling and will not break that ceiling. So my thesis statement rests on two things-first, observation. Second, numbers. So on the first one: The soft Leni but hard Anti BBM vote. They're the ones who choose Leni because BBM is the alternative. If Leni doesn't win, BBM will. For example, I get to keep some of the the true and few Leni supporter friends I have even when I am very rabid anti Leni because they don't take offense when I criticize their bet. They don't take it personally. First, they're honest enough to say that Leni isn't their ultimate bet-but they have no choice because she is the frontrunner against Marcos. Had they a better choice, they wouldn't choose Leni. But because she is the only candidate closest to BBM, they have to throw their support behind her to stop a Marcos presidency. I get it and don't begrudge it. Then there are those who are anti-PRRD, so they think Leni is the only true Opposition. How can she not be come off as only real Opposition when all she did was oppose in the 6 years she was VP? The other bets at one time showed support for the PRRD admin. Lacson, Isko, Manny supported different facets/programs of the current admin. Lacson's ATL, Isko pre pandemic/pre plans to join the race, Manny with PDP LABAN. So the very few-the ones who hate Duterte and decided to hate him because they easily fall into propaganda without doublechecking, have decided to support Leni. Meaning, they have come into supporting Leni late, and many don't love her the way the rabid loyalists Love BBM. PS: Do I think that a pro Duterte can ever choose Leni? No. I scoff at those who claim they support Leni now but still support Duterte. Nope. Not with the many roadblocks she put before this admin by continually opposing every single thing. Not when she lied about our police before the UN and embarrassed our country. Not when she lied about coordinating with AFP during natural disasters but apparently it was just some people and not the organization, all to push the idea that she's always the first on the ground-which would be fine except in her frantic push for power she diminishes the frontliners on the ground who have been there even before storms hit. So many vote Leni because they have no choice but Leni. The numbers back this. In June 2021, Leni was one of the least favorites in the Presidential Preference surveys. Hindi pa actual Presidential surveys but preference palang. She only got 6 percent. Sara was as we all know the frontrunner, followed by Isko, Bongbong, Grace, and Manny. Leni was last. Leni was last let that marinate-during a time she had already showed off as the ""first on the ground"" during the pandemic Another proof that she didn't have solid support: it took MONTHS for her own people and allies-the 1Sambayan group, to declare their support for her. It took them MONTHS to decide between Robredo and Isko. That's how weak she was Between June and September of 2021, the Presidential Preference survey only showed a 2 percent increase from 6 to 8 percent. Her number has slowly risen because the anti Marcos vote solidified behind one candidate. Many undecideds decided to back Leni because they have no other choice. Do they think she's brilliant? No Do they think she's pure? No Do they think she's great? No Do they think she has the makings of a great leader? No. Under her LP is a shadow of its former self and she couldn't even unite the Opposition. They even lashed back at her. That is what Leni has-not a solid Leni vote, just the anti Marcos vote. The 8 percent from September is now at least 24 percent (ceiling of 25-28 percent before election) because she has the anti Marcos vote. And this is ladies and gentleman the reason why the lady from Naga cannot campaign without her anti Marcos platform because she and her team knows that this is the only reason she even has the numbers to begin with. On her own, without the anti Marcos vote, Leni is nothing. O mamaya na ulit kain muna ako chicken rice.  ",1

But kudos to the BBM supporter for not losing his cool though you can tell that he was quite annoyed by the unwelcome intrusion of his space by the anti-Marcos woman. For that, he has earned the praise of netizens as shown in the comments below.

At this point I'm no longer so pissed at these kinds of people (i.e. hardcore kakampinks). I tend to lean more towards pitying them. Look how scared she is of BBM. She has been so conditioned by a political group's certain narrative that she barks at strangers, who's not even doing anything to her, like a wild dog in defense mode. Now she can't go anywhere without seeing the ghosts that her manipulators told her about. Fear is so deeply inculcated in her that she is so terrorized by mere sight of a facemask design. ",1

If you'd recall, when Leni Robredo was doing poorly in the Pulse Asia survey, many of the Kakampinks question the credibility of the survey. However, as Leni Robredo gained some points in the latest survey of Pulse Asia and eats BBM's lead, they are now changing tone and celebrating like they have already won the election. On that note, Chu took to Facebook to tell the Kakampinks to make up their minds. Do they believe the surveys now or not? Let us reading the comments of netizens on Chu's FB thread and see how they react. Netizen #1 noted Kakampinks only embrace something that suits their narrative.

Yumao ang dating pangulo noong 1989. Ang Tax Code na dapat ipairal ay ang PD 1158-A (1977) na inamyendahan ng PD 1173 (taong 1981) at PD 1994 (taong 1986), o yung batas noong oras ng kanyang kamatayan. Hindi maaaring gamitin ang kasalukuyang Tax Code o maging ang mga Republic Acts Nos. 7499 (taong 1992) at 8424 (taong 1998). Bawal sa ating Saligang Batas ang ""ex post facto law"" o yung batas na pabalik ang pagpapa-iral para magpataw ng parusa sa mga akto na hindi naman pinaparusahan noong nagawa. Hindi yun makatarungan at rasonable! Lalong hindi pwedeng paatras ang pagpapa-iral ng mga alituntunin lamang, gaya ng mga nasabing regulasyon. Kung ang batas nga e bawal iatras, yun pa kayang mga regulasyon na nabubuhay lamang at umusbong ayon sa kasalukuyang batas. Mabuti't may kaunting paggalang pa akong natitira sa kanya.

As soon as Atty. Bruce Rivera heard of Atienza's statement, he can't help but write a response. Atty. Rivera began by telling Lito that his fear will definitely happen but laughing stock? Basically, Atty. Rivera said that Filipinos need not worry of becoming the laughing stock because we already are the laughing stocking in the world when we elected Duterte. But why focus on that? We Filipinos know better, not them. But here comes Atty. Bruce's brilliant counterpunch that literally obliterated Atienza's argument in one blow. Atty. Bruce to Lito Atienza: If by any chance Manny Pacquiao becomes the next President, are we not going to be the laughing stock in the world? You may now read Atty. Bruce's original FB post below. SASAGUTIN KO ITO Sir Lito, matakot ka nga kasi mangyayari talaga yan. Pero laughing stock tayo? Una, kelan ba tayo hindi pinagtatawanan. Mahirap na bansa tayo. That is the reality. Pinagtawanan na tayo dati when we elected Duterte. But why should we give premium to that. Tayo ang Pilipino, hindi sila. Mas alam natin ang bansa natin kesa kanila. When that matters to you, dun ka tumakbo. Pangalawa, VP ka ni Manny. Kung sa palagay mo mananalo si Manny, hindi ba tayo mas pagtatawanan? Isipin mo nga sinasabi mo. Third, people who would laugh at the Philippines are at most, stuck in history. In 1986 when we removed FM, The USSR still existed, China was not a superpower, Ukraine is not a state, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia are still states, Duvalier of Haiti and Fidel Castro are still in power and there is still no pivot to Asia. If you expect Filipinos to be stuck in a 1986 rut then it confirms how stubborn and incapable you are to accept change. Kaya nga ayaw mo ng divorce, same sex marriage and even medical abortion in special instances. My advice: bumalik ka sa 1986. Dun ka tumakbong VP. Nasa Hawaii pa si BBM, menor de edad pa si Inday at marami pa ang maniniwala sa yo. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In last night's Comelec-sponsored Presidential debate, VP Leni Robredo said that politicians changing political parties weakens political party system. In that regard, Leni Robredo wants a law banning turncoatism. Robredo's statement last night has been met with raised eyebrows from netizens, including Thinking Pinoy who shared the screenshot of Philstar's quote card conveying Robredo's statement. On Facebook, Thinking Pinoy took a jab at Robredo for her audacity to make such statement when she left LP and run as independent after being in that for years: This, after she ran as independent after being in the liberal party for years. Here are some of the comments of netizens to Thinking Pinoy's FB post. Netizen #1 wrote that Leni is a woman of contradiction. every time she speaks, her words always contradict her actions Netizen #2 found Leni very funny because she says something and does the opposite. Funny how she has the gall to say that when she actually does the exact opposite...many times...almost all the time. Netizen #3 commented that Leni is to blame for opening her mouth without giving much thought only to realize later her words will come back to bite her later. That's what happens when you just open your mouth without even thinking kc you become the victim of your own words later on....in her case happened so often...you may change color but the people your with now stays the same and luckily majority now knows who and what you are and what you stand for....yourself!!! Netizen #4 dubbed Leni as inconsistent 101. Inconsistent 101 - from one who always thinks she is right and keeps attacking others in negative campaigning Netizen #5 pointed out what is Leni's problem. She can't hear what she's saying, she even doesn't understand Netizen #6 summed up Leni in one sentence. She has mastered the art of contradicting herself.*** ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A video of Senator Manny Pacquiao struggling to give a coherent answer when asked about his foreign policy if elected President has left the internet in stitches. Basically, Pacquiao wanted to say that if elected President, he will not allow the Philippines to get bullied by any country, he will not give up a square inch of PH territory to any foreign country and if necessary, we will fight because we are Filipinos. In the video, Pacquiao use English as his language of choice when he communicated his response to the question of debate panelist Ces Drilon. That proved to be a bad decision as the boxer turned senator seemed to be grasping for words to craft a coherent response, leaving the audience squirming in their seats while listening to the presidential aspirant from Gensan. If you'd recall, he challenged BBM to a one-on-one debate to talk about respective platform of governance after BBM failed to show up during the first edition of the Comelec-sponsored presidential debate. Pacquiao said BBM may be shy in joining well-attended presidential debates. After watching the video below, netizens turned to Manny Pacquiao to tell him, in case their comments will find its way to Manny, how dare him to challenge BBM to a debate if he can't even give a coherent answer to the question regarding foreign policy. Netizen #1 commented. And he has the guts to ask for a one to one kay BBM..... Netizen #2 had nothing but harsh words for the individual/s who encouraged Manny to run for President when it is obvious he is not cut to run for President because he can't even express himself, more so run the affairs of the country. My take here is that, walang puso ang mga taong nag encourage for Manny to run for president.. mabait naman si manny but I dnt think he can express himself more so ran the affairs of our country Perhaps, this is the sign from above Manny Pacquiao is waiting to make him back out from the race. Netizen #3 said. Pacquiao malamang eto na yung inaantay mong sign mula sa taas na ""mag backout"" ka na sa karera na pagka pangulo! Malugod nmn naming tatanggapin. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Radio host Mark Lopez has written an open letter addressed to President Duterte in the wake of Ely Buendia's statement regarding the Marcoses P203B estate tax. Lopez asked President Duterte if its possible to appoint Ely Buendia as his last minute appointment to the BIR perhaps he can resolve the issue surrounding the Marcoses tax liabilities. Lopez said that based on Buendia's statements, he appears to be knowledgeable. Aside from being knowledgeable with tax liabilities, Lopez joked Buendia was even brave to challenge anyone with his ""fight me"" remark. The radio host urged President Duterte to give Buendia a chance to put his money where his mouth is. Lopez's proposal has been met with laughter from his FB followers, eliciting 3,700 laugh emojis out of the 4,700 reactions from netizens. Netizens jumped into the comment section to express their agreement with Lopez's proposal to appoint Buendia to the BIR even for the fun of it. Netizen #1 commented that she is all for it and give Buendia the responsibility so that he will know and perhaps he is the answer in resolving the estate tax brouhaha. ayyyy....pabor ako dyan....bigyan ng responsibilidad para malaman din nya at bka nga sya lng ang hinihintay ng pag kakataon mukang maraming alam eh!!! ""fight me"" nga daw eh!!! Netizen #2 echoed the sentiment of the above commenter. Appoint Ely Buendia as BIR Commissioner. Sya ang susi. Mukhang malalim ang kanyang angking husay at talino sa Philippine taxation law and estate proceedings. Kagaya ng angking galing ni Pacquiao sa pag graduate sa PolSci ng less than one year. Netizen #3 took Lopez's proposal seriously and put his put down to Lopez's proposal. He doesn't know anything concerning law on taxation. What he knows is how to fluck his guitar. You may now read Mark Lopez open letter to PRRD below. Dear President Rody Duterte Puede pa ba mahabol na ma-appoint si Ely Buendia sa Bureau of Internal Revenue Philippines? Baka sya po ung makaka resolve sa issue ng sinasabi nilang tax liabilities... Mukhang maraming alam eh. And matapang pa na ""fight me"" daw. Bigyan natin ng pagkakataon na to put his money where his mouth is. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Direk Manny Castaneda has been keeping his presidential choice close to his chest since the start of the campaign period because he still want more time to study the other candidates but one thing is certain, she is not voting for Leni, But today, the veteran and multi-awarded movie director has finally revealed his choice and that is none other than BBM for the simple reason that he believes BBM abhors the CPP-NPA-NDF and if he becomes the next President, he will do everything in his power to finally put the communist insurgency problem in the country behind us. Whatever BBM intends to do other than ending the communist problem is just a bonus. You may now read Direk Mannny Castaneda's original FB post. I would like to believe that BBM abhors the CPP-NPA-NDF and whatever variations and forms of communism that exist here in the Philippines. Should he be given the chance to be president, I am convinced he will exert all efforts to finally put an end to the communist insurgency in the country. It is for this reason alone that I will vote for Bongbong Marcos. Other than that, whatever good he intends to do for the country would be an added bonus for me. And please spare me the very stale magnanakaw narrative. It is so over-used, masyadong gastado na, it has lost its shock value from all angles. Besides, for decades, after 1986, the Aquinos had complete control of the government plus the cooperation of foreign governments and still they failed to fully identify and recover the alleged hidden cum ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. Either the hidden wealth is just a myth or saksakan lang sila ng tanga. At kung ninakawan nga tayo ng pamilya Marcos... ginago naman tayo ng mga Aquino. Para sa akin, hamak na mas masakit yun. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The buzzword these days in social media is estate tax and the so-called P203B the Marcoses owe to the BIR in particular and the government in general. If Yorme Isko or Manny becomes President, they expressed intention to collect the money owed by the Marcoses to the government and use it in the government's post-covid recovery program. But the questions are: Do the Marcoses really have to issue a bank check or pay in cash to the BIR if indeed they owe P203B estate tax? What is BBM's complicity to the issue? I am no expert on this so let us read the FB post of Atty. Bruce Rivera who clarified that he is not a Marcos apologist but the hullabaloo surrounding the unpaid estate taxes has become so unfair, it needs a good tongue lashing. In the same FB post, Atty. Rivera also mentioned Yorme Isko and asked a hypothetical question how he feels if his children will be asked to pay estate taxes in the event of his passing since he heard ""rumor"" he allegedly owned Divisoria? Of course Yorme Isko does not own Divisoria. I suspect Atty. Rivera said this to drive home his point that the Marcoses are just rumored to own some of these contested properties and yet they were asked to pay estate taxes. At one point in Atty. Rivera's post, he mentioned Imee Marcos swearing they do not own a certain real estate and now they are already in the hands of certain rich families. You may now read Atty. Rivera's easy to follow explanation of estate tax for your education. ESTATE TAX AND BBM I am not a Marcos apologist but the hulabaloo regarding unpaid estate tax has become so unfair, it needs tongue lashing. An estate is a juridical person that serves as an extension of the personality of a dead person for the purpose of collecting and paying debts and distributing what remains thereof to the legal or compulsory heirs. Basahin ang kaso ni Limjuco vs. The Estate of Pedro Fragante. What is now the implication of this? First, the estate has the duty to pay taxes. The estate which are the property left by Ferdinand E. Marcos pays for it. Not the heirs. Not Imelda, not Imee. Not BBM. Because before they can even have the properties transferred to their names, taxes have to be settled. Second, when the state collects estate taxes on a dead man's properties, it presupposes that the property subject of the tax is OWNED by the deceased. Hence, if the state has assessed estate taxes, it is deemed an admission by the state that Marcos, the father is the rightful owner. Problem is, there are so many properties alleged to be owned by FM but disputed by the government. Hindi naman siguro tama kung pababayaran ang estate tax ng isang bahay na kay Marcos daw tapos may adverse claim na nakaw na yaman ito. Some of the properties are real estate that Imee knows they never owned and are already in the hands of other rich families. Two points. If indeed ownership is no longer in question, the state can easily LEVY or take the said properties. And the estate tax should have been considered PAID. Problem is, even if the SC has ruled that FM estate owes estate taxes, the BIR could not levy it because the ownership is disputed. And even if may assessment na, the period to default will only begin to run once ownership is finally settled. And what is BBM complicity in all of these? WALA. He is just the son, legal heir and administrator. Wala siyang utang na estate tax kasi ang estate ni late president ang may responsibilidad magbayad nun. Kung bakit hindi makolekta at hindi maremata ng gobyerno sa matagal na panahon ay dapat tinatanong sa BIR at hindi ginagawang issue kay BBM at sa pamilya. At sa mga nagsasabiing bayaran na lang, ito ang ibabalik kong tanong. Kayo ba, babayaran mo ang buwis sa isang bahay na sinasabi ng gobyerno ay hindi sa yo? Kung oo ang sagot mo, tanga ka lang. At itatanong ko kay Isko, paano kung sisingilin ang anak mo ng gobyerno ng estate tax sa Divisoria after ka matigok dahil ikaw daw may ari, matutuwa ba ang kaluluwa mo? The reason BBM popularity is growing can be explained in very simple terms. If you see a man kicked, punched, stabbed, choked and mob lynched to the point of absurdity that it is beyond the notion of retribution for the sins of his family, it will go to a level of oppression that will force those who could not care less to speak up and protect this man. Because humanity has no political color. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Ang OA ha! This phrase essentially summarizes the FB post of Direk Manny Castaneda on Dilawans who were crying to the heavens after the photo circulating on social media showed Ninoy Aquino's statue partially blocked by a makeshift tent put up by the organizers for the local press who covered the BBM- Sara campaign rally in Tarlac today. Castaneda asked if it's not ok to have Ninoy's statue covered even for a brief moment when there are plenty of Ninoy and Cory statues built all over the Philippines? Is it the image of God that blocking it is not ok? Castaneda asked. Sa dinamidami ng mga pinatayong mga istatwa ni ninoy at cory sa buong Pilipinas, ano naman kung matakpan kahit sandali ang isa? Imahin ba ito ng panginoon at hindi pwedeng harangan? Ang OA ha! Netizens seem to agree with Direk Manny's sentiment as shown in the comments below. Netizen #1 joked that the Dilawans should be grateful that Ninoy was not allowed to see that many people attended the BBM-Sara rally to think that they announced earlier Tarlac is Pink. pasalamat nga sila d pinamukha kay ninoy na maraming dumalo sa rally ng bbm sara tarlac is pinknation daw e hahaha. Mamaya gumalaw pa yan at magwalk out kaya ok na d nya nakikita.❤❤❤ Netizen #2 commented that the Dilawans just find it unacceptable that too many people don't give a damn about Ninoy's statue. Hindi nila tanggap na walang pake na mga tao sa rebulto ni Ninoy. Alam na nming lahat yung pagsisinungaling nila, c Kris na lng ata hindi nakakahalata Netizen #3 remarked that the organizers of BBM-Sara rally really has no choice. Had they left Ninoy's statue uncovered, for sure they will hear unflattering remarks from the Dilawans. Kung hindi natakpan yung rebolto para ding umattend siya sa rally. Ma issue na naman yun. So, much better na tinakpan in respect naman kay Ninoy na sigurado hindi gustong umattend ng BBM/Sara rally. Hindi naman kina cover ang rebolto, natakpan lang ang view. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A photo of Kiko Pangilinan looking on in the background while an LGU executive raised the hand of Leni Robredo has left this netizen wondering what kind of leader Leni Robredo would be. If you are look at the photo below, the woman raising Leni Robredo's hand is Zamboanga City Mayor Beng Climaco. Climaco is promoting Rosa (Robredo-Sara) tandem to her Zamboanga constituents. Chu, who is not a BBM fan, can't help but watch the BBM-Sara tandem in awe for presenting themselves as a team - a strong message to the voters that ""you won't get me if you won't get her and vice versa.""This is what the voters are seeing and they are embracing it. The public see this as teamwork and understand that unity is not just some platform, it's a prerequisite in our leaders so the public don't have a sense of de javu of Duterte-Robredo. However, Chu noted that this is not the case of the Leni-Kiko tandem. The fact that Leni did not react or told the LGU execs who are pairing her with Sara to stop it says a lot about her person. How can she ask people to trust Kiko when she herself is willing to leave him behind? Chu asked. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Even when I'm not a fan of BBM, I admire the way he and Mayor Sara always present themselves as a team -it's a solid message of ""you won't get me if you won't get her, you won't get her if you won't get me."" Many voters repeatedly see this messaging and we take it to heart. We see teamwork-and we understand that unity is not just some platform, it's a requirement in our leaders so we don't have a repeat of Duterte- Robredo. It's an oft-repeated message-we are partners. What kind of leader would Leni be, to leave Kiko at the back like that as she faces the crowd with whichever LGU official raises her hand? Why not pull him so he is on the other side instead of pathetically looking on? He's not some Senatorial candidate-he's her partner. How can she ask people to trust him when she herself is willing to leave him behind? These are some of the little, commonsensical things that very few notice about Leni's ""caliber"" of leadership. PS: Yes I have more photos not just this one, of Leni leaving Kiko behind. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In a series she called ""Why not Leni Robredo?"" Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu talked very briefly about common sense things Leni Robredo doesn't get. Chu cited the hiring of Bam Aquino as campaign manager and allowing some random chef with no marketing knowhow to create ridiculous campaign videos for her (hadouken) as a perfect examples. Chu reckoned that if Leni cannot even choose a good campaign manager and team, she wondered what kind of Cabinet members will she hire? Chu advised Leni supporters to think very hard before voting for her. She warned how Robredo and company behave in the elections is how they'll behave after they get elected. Chu's assertions have been met with mixed reactions from netizens. Here are some of the comments from anti-Leni Robredo netizens. My main reason why not her is how she kept on contradicting the government that she's a part of. Instead of providing constructive criticism, she took advantage to make herself look good. Why NOT Leni Robredo? Simply because she's still a puppet of Liberal Party. #NeverAgaintoLiberals Probably bring back incompetent people from PNoy's term as her cabinet secretaries. Just the thought of it makes me shiver. Here are some of the comments from netizens who are obviously pro-Robredo and cleverly used Chu's statements to defend the Vice President. A basketball coach doesn't have to be a player himself. A voice teacher/coach or manager doesn't have to be a singer. Our teacher in our major course does not have to be in his profession as well. Malay nyo naman her campaign manager doesn't have to be a senator himself to be good. Objective lang. Unfair kse yung analysis for other professional and managers. How they behave in the elections is how they'll behave when they're elected.. So that means..pag si Leni, masipag pa din, nakikisalamuha pa din, at sumusulpot sa mga commitments nya. Nice. You must have forgotten girl (selective amnesia) that BBM's campaign manager is Benhur Abalos, remember the NBN-ZTE deal, that's his father. Same same, pare pareho lang. Candidate is from the family of thieves, campaign manager is from the family of corrupt politicians. Birds of the same feather... You may read Chu's original FB post below. Common sense things that Leni Robredo doesn't get: 1. Hiring a campaign manager who couldn't make himself win as Senator in 2019, and allowing random chefs with no marketing backgrounds to create ridiculous campaign videos for her, like the Hadouken. If she cannot even choose a good campaign manager and campaign team, what kind of Cabinet members will she hire? Mag isip isip kayo. How they behave in the elections is how they'll behave if they become elected. STAY TUNED THIS IS A SERIES OF ""Why not Leni Robredo?""A ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Manny Pacquiao's amateurish attempt to use Martial Law to scare and dissuade Pinoy voters to vote for BBM as President has backfired. On that note, Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous chided Senator Pacquiao, saying that somebody who is running for President, he should at least possess a working knowledge about our Constitution. Atty. Ahmed lectured Senator Pacquiao that the basis to declare martial law is stated specifically in Sec. 18 Art. VII of the Cory Constitution. Atty. Ahmed also pointed out to Senator Pacquiao the safeguards to prevent another Marcos-type of Martial Law such as the existence of rebellion and lawless violence before martial law can be declared. After the declaration of martial law, the President must report to Congress. The Congress have the power to revoke Martial law if they deemed there was no basis for declaring such. Atty. Ahmed remarked that despite the apprehension of Cory's men regarding Martial law, they still included it in the Cory Constitution because this is the only way to protect the State. You may now read Atty. Ahmed's original FB post below. Kung tatakbo bilang pangulo, kahit paano dapat may working knowledge ng saligang batas. Sen. Manny, andun po yung basehan ng pagdedeklara ng martial law, specifically sa Sec 18 Art. VII. Itong probisyon na ito, ayon sa sanaysay sa Official Gazette ay ginawa precisely para hindi na daw maulit ang deklarasyong tulad ng kay Presidente Marcos nuong 1972. Kailangan po may rebelyon o laganap na lawless violence. Matapos ang deklarasyon kailangan mag report ang pangulo sa Kongreso. Ang Kongreso naman, maaaring i-revoke ang deklarasyon. Talaga pong never again to the Ferdinand Marcos type of martial law kasi dati walang ganitong nakalagay sa saligang batas. In fact, walang banggit ng martial law sa 1935 constitution. Si dating senador Juan Ponce Enrile po ang gumawa ng legal justification nuon. Nguni't kahit ang feeling ng mga opisyales ni Presidente Cory na pasong paso sila sa martial law nuon, nilagay pa rin nila ito sa saligang batas dahil isa itong paraan para protektahan ang estado. Ayaw ninyong protektahan ang estado kapag namemeligro ito? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A Kakampink supporter who questioned Sara Duterte's achievements as Mayor other than the punching incident with the Sheriff is in for a rude awakening after a staunch Duterte supporter caught on to his FB post. The Kakampink's FB post did not sit well with the self-proclaimed ""Queen of Bardagulan"" who was apparently pissed that someone has the audacity to question Sara Duterte's achievements as Mayor of Davao City, hence also questioning what made her Sara thinks she is ready to run for a national position and vice president at that in her first try. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu isn't pleased how the Kakampink supporter framed his question it is as if he is trying to make it appear it's Sara's fault he is ignorant of the Davao City mayor's achievements because they don't know how to research. Chu went on to enumerate Sara Duterte's achievements as Davao City mayor. Foremost of which is - Sara is leaving Davao City debt-free. Not only that, Davao City is in the top 10 richest city in the Philippines under her term. Take note: Sara have done this at the time of pandemic. Chu urged the Kakampink supporter to ask Yorme Isko how hard it is to achieve a debt-free city. If I may add, the City of Manila has acquired billions of debt because Yorme Isko decided to build several infrastructure projects for the city before stepping down to seek a higher office like the Tondominium projects, a huge public hospital and school buildings for Manilenos, etc.. Chu ended the FB post by warning the Kakampink supporters to spare Sara Duterte or else the DDS will retaliate and put Sara and Leni's achievements side by side and they will see that Leni's achievements is only fit to run for SK Chairman. Kasalanan pa ni Sara na di kayo marunong mag research. Mga Lutang Anak. Sara lang naman is leaving Davao City not just debt free-ask any Mayor, ask Isko for example how hard this is-but leaving it as 8th or 9th richest city in the Philippines. Two notches higher than when PRRD left. During the time of pandemic ha. Some cities in the PH are rich but have debt. She's also very techy, having partnered with IBM, they even have robots detecting bombs or something like that, and also she expanded the underground cabling of her city. For you to have underground cabling you have to make sure to meet not just technical requirements but also traffic management and urban planning. In short Kumusta dyan sa City mo, naka underground cable na ba? Wag si Inday Sara kasi Baka Pag Tinabi yung ""achievements"" kuno ng lawyer nyo sa lawyer namin Baka isipin nyong pang SK CHAIRMAN lang yung sa inyo. No offense to SK CHAIRMAN. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Every candidate wants President Duterte to raise his/her hand whether on top of a makeshift stage or in Malacanang and definitely in front of the camera for the public to see. This is especially true for the Presidential aspirants. Isko covets PRRD's endorsement. Pacquiao too. Even Leni's camp will not refuse a Presidential endorsement. BBM also said something along that line recently. To think that in the last 3 Presidential elections, no Presidential candidate emerged victorious after getting the endorsement of the outgoing President. Cory endorsed FVR. FVR won because the so-called Spirit of EDSA was still fresh in the people's memory. Of course Miriam protested, claiming she was cheated by FVR. But her protest was eventually defeated. FVR endorsed Joe de Venecia and Erap won by a landslide. Erap did not have the luxury of endorsing his successor because he was ousted from Malacanang. GMA endorsed Gibo Teodoro and PNoy won. PNoy endorsed Roxas and PRRD won. Given the history of the Presidential endorsement wherein all presidential candidates endorsed by the incumbent lost terribly in the polls makes you wonder why PRRD's endorsement is still the sought after these days. Well, PRRD is the only outgoing President in recent history whose trust and approval ratings remain high a few months before he steps down. PNoy's trust rating was 49% in March 2016 as per Rappler report here. At this juncture, PRRD's net satisfaction rating is 60%+ as per SWS December 2021 survey. With that being said, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu would prefer BBM does not get PRRD's endorsement. Why? Please continue reading below and Chu will tell you her reasons. Believe me. You will like Chu's line of reasoning if you keep an open mind. I think PRRD shouldn't endorse anyone so that the win of BBM is even more legitimate, and will not be tagged by bitter Opposition as ""admin-backed."" Although an endorsement will help, the only thing PRRD has to do now is not say anything damaging about Uniteam, and not endorse anyone else. BBM can already coast on his own popularity. Let them fight it out. I guess a big part of why PRRD doesn't endorse them is that he promised honest and fair elections and fair means not backing anyone at this point.

Pinoy Trending News,"On Leni Robredo trumping up rivals in campus surveys, award-winning movie director and actor Manuel Castaneda made a comment that left his social media followers amused. Here's the brief FB post of Direk Manny that left his followers in stitches. I've noticed that some pro Robredo schools/universities have conducted surveys within their campus with Robredo winning against all other presidential candidates. That's great if she's running for president of their PTA or Student Council but utterly irrelevant as a presidential candidate of the the republic. Parang niloloko lang nila ang kanilang sarili.

Niloloko talaga sarili nila, direk.Umaasa ng wagas! Netizen #2 fact-checked Direk Manny's statement but as a friend. Direk...wala na yata PTA sa colleges...sa high school nalang..hehe Netizen #3 shared her observation with regards to university polls. Actually, university polls have historically been a reliable predictor of who's NOT going to win. The demographics are too homogenous, at least with respect to world view/ideology. Netizen #4 commented that these same students who are Leni supporters actually believe they are smarter than their parents and grandparents, ergo they can dictate who to vote for as President. Yes, and these students actually believe that they know more than their parents and grandparents. And they have not even graduated from the university yet. These are the people who, 10 years from today, will get themselves so fiercely bitch-slapped when they see what it is like out in the real world. And they would say to themselves, God, what twits we were! The effing idiots are not even grateful for what they are enjoying today because of what the present administration has done for the nation. To which Direk Manny replied: that is exactly what i feel now after being active in student protests during my high school years. I was such a gullible idiot back then and making up for my mistakes now. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"The sight of supporters braving the heavy downpour in one of BBM-Sara campaign rallies has left some netizens in awe, including Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu. In a Facebook post, Chu wrote she is hoping to the high heavens that BBM works very hard as the next President to deserve the love and devotion his supporters have showered him in his campaign sorties. She also hope BBM deserves the broken family relationships and friendships that have turned sour because of the election. Chu said that if BBM can surpass his father the better and she hope he does because many people have invested so much in him only to be disappointed in the end because he failed to meet the high hopes and expectations of his many supporters. Chu talked about how PRRD worked so hard to be worthy of her support and the millions of DDS and now near the end of PRRD's term, she can tell anyone to their faces that all the ""bardagulan"" (social media verbal war) she did defending PRRD was worth it. Chu ended the FB post with the message for BBM -be better than great because of his supporters have walked the extra mile for him, like braving the heavy downpour to show him their support. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Even with the heavy downpour, as soon as BBM came out, people started rushing back to the area. Since his win is imminent, I just hope to high heavens that BBM works very hard to deserve this love and devotion his supporters have given to him. I hope he really deserves their love and faith and support. I hope he deserves the friendships ended and the family ties severed because of the elections. Kung kaya nya maging better sa Tatay nya I hope he does because these people who've put their faith in him have invested so much in him. I am grateful to PRRD because he worked so hard to be worth our support. Tinatapos ko ang term na ito na kaya ko harapin kahit sino and look them in the eye and say, ""oh Ano, see? E di tama ako."" I'm very grateful di ako napahiya sa lahat ng bardagulan ko. Everything was worth it. I hope that BBM delivers, for the sake of these people who, literally come hell or high water, have turned up for him.

Meanwhile, Chu reminded BBM-Sara supporters not to fall such gimmick from Tricia Robredo in order to win their votes because the same Tricia Robredo mocked PRRD on Twitter, asking if PRRD was still asleep when it was already 8AM.

AMPAPLASTIK NG MGA RADIKAL MAGMAHAL BUTI PA AKO SALBAHE FROM START TO FINISH Netizen #1 said play pretend as the Oscar host and awarded Tricia a trophy for being the #1 hypocrite ever but changed her mind at the last minute. And the Oscars for the Thickest Plastic ever goes to.... [ay wait, baka masampal ako.] hahahahahahaha!! Netizen #2 predicted that Kakampinks pretending to be nice will expire on May 9. After losing the election, they will return to their old ways. Hanggang Mayo 9 lang po yang bait-baitan na yan. Pag matalo sila, balik sila in criticizing the government. Never Again. X#plastic#hypocrite Netizen #3 said the photo screams of hypocrisy in all levels. This screams 'kaplastican' in all levels. It's funny that they are resorting to this now, when for the past years since PRRD became president, all they did was alienate the masses, insult the president and his government and bash those who think differently from them. It's obvious that they are just doing this because of an agenda. You cannot hide your true self (one that you have manifested for so long for the past years) just by suddenly reaching out to those whom you bashed and called stupid. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In response to criticism from some Manilenos and even non-Manilenos for selling the Divisoria public market, Yorme Isko defended his action saying he will even sell the City Hall, including the clock tower so that his Manilenos will have food to eat. Yorme Isko's statement has raised the eyebrows of netizens, including US-based accountant Edwin Jamora who took to Facebook to pose several questions towards the direction of Yorme Isko, apparently to expose how porous Yorme's logic in justifying the sale of the Divisoria public market. On Facebook, Jamora wrote: You solve hunger by selling government properties? Bakit? Nakakain ba ang mga buildings na yan? Ahh... kasi pang ayuda. So, paano pag naubos na pang-ayuda? Alin ang next na ibebenta? Yung mga buildings naman sa kabilang bayan?! Jamora went on to pose additional questions, to pulverize Yorme Isko's another layer justification for the disposal of the property of his city. Eh Yung Divisoria Market ba is idle? Who died and the ""IDLE"" definition changed?! Here are some of the comments from netizens, hitting Yorme Isko. Netizen #1 said that Yorme Isko is a stupid president if he wins. Bobong presidente yan pag nanalo, isipin mo kahit ubusin mo ibenta pag aari ng gobyerno hindi mawawala ang nagugutom kong hinid ka mag poproduce ng trabaho by inviting investors Netizen #2 commented that this is just band aid solution. After the money is gone, people will still go hungry. Korek, panandaliang solusyon lang, nganga kapag naubos na Netizen #3 wrote that the one who sold the Divisoria Public market is selfish and in just 3 years, he betrayed the Manilenos. Hinde katwiran Yan pang sarili mo lang Yan marameng umupong Jan pero walang nakaisip magbenta Ng property Ng Isang bayan marameng pwedeng solusyon para sa pagkukuhaan Ng budget sa Isang kungsod Ikaw lang isko Ang gumawa Nyan makasarili k 3 years k palang Jan nagawa mo Ng traydurin Ang manileño ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Sa mga nag screenshots ng bad definition sa facebook na cunning, scheming, and unscrupulous, ayan. Basa.. This is message of political blogger Noel Landero Sarifa to critics of BBM who were posting the bad definition of Machiavellian on Facebook. Sarifa reposted the quote card from SMNI News quoting Prof. Anna Malindog-Uy to counter their misinformation against BBM. According to the Prof. Malindog-Uy, being Machiavellian isn't bad. She thinks a leader should be Machiavellian. As a Machiavellian, your pragmatic decisions are always based on what is good for the country and for your people. Prof. Malindog-Uy remarked that all successful countries in the world, they have Machiavellian leaders. That's the meaning of Machiavellian, the leaders are realistic. If you are a Machiavellian, you are realistic. Here are some of the interesting comments from netizens below. Netizen #1 commented that perhaps the BBM critics only read the negative meaning of Machiavellian. This goes to show how shallow-minded the Dilawans are. Naku baka yung negative side na meaning na naman a ang iniisip nila. Pinapakita lang talaga itong mga pinklawan ang kababawan ng kanilang pag-iisip. Walang lamang ang kanilang coconut shell...Pero sa totoo lang sa aking opinion dapat magkatuwang ang negative at positive side ng isang machiavellian leader para mas matagumpay ang kaniyang pamumuno. (eg)ang isang matagumpay na pinuno o leader dapat minsan mabagsik may kamay na bakal at minsan kaylangan din nandyan ang pagsisinungaling. Dahil hindi lahat ng panahon at pagkakataon ay magsasabi ka ng katotohanan, kumbaga may top secret. Yun ang idea ko sa isang matagumpay na pinuno subalit nadudun pa rin ang kaniyang kababaang loob at may hinanakit o pagmamahal sa kaniyang sinasakupang pinamumunuan. Netizen #2 wrote that even the successful companies are headed by CEO's who have Machiavellian trait. pati mga tagumpay na malalaking companya, ang kanilang CEO ay machiavellian din ang trait. Netizen #3 said he preferred a realistic leader over a dumb plastic leader who pretends he/she is brilliant. Mas maganda Yung leader na realistic kesa SA isang leader na lutang na plastik na nagpapanggap na magaling SA lahat Ng bagay.❤❤❤ Netizen #4 remarked that we have an oversupply of genius commenters but did not get to watch the SMNI DEEP PROBE and heard BBM's explanation why he is a Machiavellian. Ang dami kasing ""sobrang talino"" na nagkokoment lalo na kung hindi naman sila nanood ng SMINI DEEP PROBE base dun sa explanation ni BBM.

Pinoy Trending News,"International relations expert and SMNI Deep Probe panelist Sass Rogando Sasot is pro-BBM and when asked by Kakampinks why? Sasot cited 4 reasons why BBM got her nod to stop Kakampinks from further inquisition. Basically, Sasot said that BBM has the best approach when it comes to foreign policy although she also admitted they have differences in terms of the US-RP relations. Sasot called BBM the most liberal-minded among all candidates. Not liberal in the sense of Yellow liberalism but what she called right use of the Liberal philosophy. Sasot went on to announce that if any Kakampinks foreign policy experts who wishes to debate with her about BBM's foreign policy, she is just PM away. Why si BBM? Sure. 1. My field is foreign policy. He has the best approach to it. Nonetheless, I have some differences with him in terms of understanding US-Phillippine relations. I am more aligned with Claro M. Recto, Duterte, and even Ka Leody's understanding. 2. He is also the most liberal-minded among all the candidates. Liberal as in the right use of the philosophy ha and not this Yellow liberalism. One can glean it from his answers to moral dilemma questions asked to him in his interviews - not just on SMNI. Although I am more leaning ideologically towards Gonzales's PDSP party. Gonzales and I simply had the same Nordic experience and exposure. 3. I had followed BBMS stance about the South China Sea conflict since he was a senator. It's the stance that I fully align with. 4. Further, BBM is the most technologically and scientifically knowledgeable among all of them. Thus, he is set to be a modernizer President. I hope he would really use the full power of the president to do that to spearhead a scientific revolution in the Philippines. There. Now, if there's any Kakampink foreign policy analyst who would debate me about BBM's foreign policy line, I will gladly take the challenge. Sabihin nyo lang kung saan at kailan. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"An annoyed netizen called VP Leni Robredo's statement (see quote card below for context) as one of the most egotistical statements she put out to date. The woman netizen, a self-proclaimed Robredo critic, went on to give Robredo a free lecture on Public Service 101. According to the netizen, every single candidate for public office is mandated to render public service to their constituents regardless of political color when elected. Cunanan said that for this reason, she will never vote for Robredo because she reminds her of the last LP President and also the previous LP Presidential candidate whom she described as vengeful, petty and divisive. Cunanan said such statement from Robredo is unimaginable to most good candidates. The author of the FB post is none other than TraveLife Magazine publisher Christine Cunanan. You may now read Christine Cunanan's original FB post below. With all due respect, Madame Veep, this is one of the most egotistical statements you've put out yet. Do you think you are special? You are stating the obvious. Every single candidate for public office is ethically required and duty bound to govern fairly and to take care of their constitutents, whether these constituents voted for them or not. This is why I will never vote for you. You will be the most petty, divisive and vengeful president in our history along with the last LP President and also the previous LP presidential candidate who was quoted on camera in Tacloban implying that aid funds were being withheld because Tacloban is Romualdez country. Favoring those who voted for you and actually making it a big deal that you have treated fairly those who didn't- this is unimaginable to most good candidates. Just to remind you that this is Public Service 101 for most candidates. All elected officials should treat their constituents fairly and equally as true public servants. This is neither an option nor a big deal for anyone running for public office. It's just SOP. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In a Facebook post, TraveLife Magazine publisher Christine Cunanan lashed out at a Leni supporter who visits her FB wall spewing alleged things ad nauseum from decades ago to discredit BBM, calling them pathetic. Cunanan said this could only mean one thing - haters are rehashing the same alleged things because they have nothing new to discredit BBM. Cunanan broke the bad news to the critics of BBM - their rehashed propaganda against BBM have no more effect, especially when their own bet flunked the bar twice and can't even remember how many islands the country she hopes to lead has. Cunanan said labels are inconsequential but leadership skills and real intelligence are king because they are needed to dissect complex issues before us accurately and come up with the best decisions. Much of this is learned in the real world, not in the four-corners of the classrooms some 42+ years ago, Cunanan said. Cunanan concluded that based on what see on Robredo and BBM, she should be running for barangay captain while BBM is fit to become the next leader of the country. You may now read Christine Cunanan's original FB post below. Honestly. Just trespassing on people's walls and posting over and over again about alleged things from over 42+ years ago to discredit BBM (#7), the front runner, is just pathetic. Ibig sabihin wala nang ibang maibabato. Wala na rin effect as bingi na kami sa pagrinig ng mga ganito - especially when their own candidate flunked the bar twice and can't remember how many islands the country she is supposed to lead has. And what a disservice too to all the school dropouts who went on to greater things. It's really not about labels but about the leadership skills and real intelligence needed to dissect the complicated issues before us accurately and make the best decisions. Much of this is learned in the real world and not at school 42+ years ago. All I can say is that so far, The Veep has shown that she should be running for a barangay position instead of for the presidency. Whereas BBM has shown clearly that he is fit for the highest and most difficult position in the Philippines. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Noel Landero Sarifa, if you are a true Duterte supporter I assume you know this dude, wanted Leni, Kiko and Manny to answer some important questions with regards to BBM. Although, the chances of Sarifa's questions reaching its intended recipients and having them answered is very slim unless local media pick it up and relay it to the above-mentioned personalities. Still Sarifa asked the questions anyway because having his persuasive arguments reach the supporters of the 3 presidential aspirants, his chances of dissuading some of them from believing all the misconceptions and lies about BBM that has been feed to them for ages is already a victory for him. Basically, Sarifa's arguments are simple. If BBM is really an evil person as local media and the Opposition portrayed him to be, why he has the overwhelming support and love of the public as shown in the surveys? Second, if the Opposition candidates are really good and brilliant and BBM is indeed the thief, what are they are afraid of? Are their brilliance not enough to match with that of BBM? Sarifa asked. Sarifa wrapped up the FB post by urging BBM's rivals not to fear BBM and engage in mudslinging. Instead, Sarifa advised BBM's rivals to show the people why they deserve their vote and not why BBM does not deserve their vote. You may now read Noel Sarifa's original FB post. Tanong lang.. Kung masama ang mga Marcos as they are portrayed by the media and the opposition bakit overwhelming ang pagmamahal ng taumbayan sa kanila? BBM is leading in all surveys. Kung sila ang magaling at si BBM ang magnanakaw, bakit sila natatakot? Baka hindi enough ang galing nila para pantayan si BBM. Kung tunay nga na para sa bayan ang adhikaing makatulong at kung sila ang nararapat, why so obsessed in stopping a Marcos comeback? Di ba dapat makikita ng taumbayan yun? O wala talagang makitang sincerity ang tao sa kanila? Ano ang meron sa pagbabalik ng mga Marcos na sobra nyong kinakatakot? Kung magnanakaw si BBM, bakit pinayagan ng Comelec? Ilang dekada na yang public servant, ilang dekada nang binoboto ng taumbayan, bakit di maipakulong ng mga nagsisigaw ng magnanakaw? Why can't you all provide your proof of evidence and bring it to court if your claims are valid. Iba na ang panahon ngayon na dati one sided lang ang balita, social media has given us the option to see what is not relayed properly, wag kayong matakot at manira kung alam nyong kayo ang magaling at kayo ang karapat dapat, show people bakit ikaw, hindi yong bakit hindi sya.

Sa amin pong pagkaka-alam, never did we ask for any help or favor from your family. Ilang beses po humingi ng tulong si Ma'am Cory sa family namin since PNoy ran for Congress and Senate. And when he ran for president, my mom was tasked to be the provincial convenor under the People Power Volunteers for Reform here in the province of Tarlac. Wala po kaming hiningi ng kahit anong tulong o pabor (pinansyal man o trabaho) na kapalit sa pamilya ninyo. Ito po ay sa kadahilanang mataas ang aming respeto sa inyong ina.

But for you to maliciously accuse my mom in public of ""walang utang na loob"", I cannot let your lies & intrigues malign my mom just for the political mileage of your candidate. We owe it to Boss Danding and Cong. Henry Cojuangco when they encouraged my mom to run for Board Member and then city mayor under the NPC. Apparently, hindi po niyo alam ang nangyayare dito sa Tarlac City. For me, this is not the style of a Grand Rally Campaign for a presidential candidate that a national figure like you to be personally attacking a small city mayor like my mom.

Pinoy Trending News,"The buzzword in the internet lately is estate tax. Netizens have been talking about it since the rivals of BBM raised the issue during one of the Presidential debates. Mayor Isko Moreno, if I was not mistaken raised the issue in a GMA News article dated February 28, 2022, vowed to collect the Marcos family's estate tax debt of P200 billion if elected President while proposing to use the money for aid. In the subsequent debate, particularly the Comelec-sponsored debate, presidential candidates like Pacquiao, Lacson and Robredo echoed Moreno's sentiment on the Marcos estate taxes. However, let us not dwell on the case but let us know what is estate tax. Go to the Luminous FB page if you want to know more about the Marcos estate tax case. They are the experts on the issue. Don't worry! It is not as complicated as you think. Netizen Joanna Bacani Sison posted on her FB wall an easy to understand explanation of estate tax. Sison's post on estate tax has generated quite reaction since she published it on March 19, 2022, eliciting 5,000 reactions and 8,300 shares and counting. You may now read Sison's explanation on estate tax below. Mag aral muna tayo ng konti... 1. What is Estate Tax - Estate Tax is a tax on the right of the deceased person to transmit his/her estate to his/her lawful heirs and beneficiaries at the time of death and on certain transfers, which are made by law as equivalent to testamentary disposition. IT IS NOT A TAX ON PROPERTY. It is a tax on RIGHT of TRANSFERING THE PROPERTY. *In Tagalog, ito ay buwis para sa ari arian ng namayapang tao upang maisalin sa kanyang Tagapag mana ang pagmamay ari nito. 2. What is the effect if you do not pay Estate tax upon the death of the person owning the estate? - An ASSET will not be distributed accordingly until the payment of ESTATE tax. It is imperative that payment and filings of Estate tax return be made six months after the death of the decedent.Otherwise, surcharge and penalty will be incurred and THE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE TRANSFERRED TO THE HEIR OR THIRD PARTY. ** Sa tagalog, sa loob ng anim na buwan, matapos mamatay ang nagpapamana, kailangan mong bayadan ang estate tax. Kung hindi mo nabayadan sa loob ng palugit,magkakaroon ng kaukulang penalty at lalaki ang buwis mo. Hanggat hindi mo to nababayaran, ito ay mananatili sa pangalan ng namatay na may ari at hindi maisasalin sa tagapag mana at hindi rin maisasalin sa pangalan ng ibang tao, lalo na kung may intensyon na ibenta. *** Ito ang dahilan kung bakit madami sa Pilipino, isang daang taon ng patay ang mga ninuno, pero sa kanila pa din nakapangalan yung mga tinitirahan nyong bahay. May pananagutan ka ba sa batas kung ganun ang sitwasyon? WALA Hindi mo lang talaga yan maisasalin sa pangalan mo at hindi mo siya maibebenta. ****Hindi ka tax evader, kung sakaling namatay ang lolo at lola mo, at iniwanan ka ng ekta ektarayang lupain pero wala kang cash sa bulsa para bayadan ang estate tax, or kung may pera ka nga pero ayaw mong bayadan ang estate tax dahil wala ka naman pake kung sa lolo at lola mo pa din nakapangalan ang titulo. Pwede mo siyang patuloy na gamitin, taniman, tirahan, gawing pang hanap buhay at kung ano ano pa, hanggang sa ka apu apuhan mo ng hindi nagbabayad ng estate tax. Hope this enlighten everyone. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Fact: Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu is supporting BBM-Sara tandem in the 2022 polls but in 2016, she campaigned online for Robredo and against BBM. But after what Leni Robredo did to President Duterte and his administration, Chu turned her back on Leni Robredo. She was an anti-Marcos through and through but since she made a promise that whoever leads in the surveys and can stop Robredo from succeeding PRRD, she will throw her support behind that candidate. And that candidate is none other than BBM. But as a fellow woman, Chu has nothing but good intention for Leni Robredo when she took to Facebook issuing a warning to the Vice President, in the wake of her alliance with former House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez. Basically, Chu just want to tell Robredo that Pantaleon Alvarez does not like her. In fact, Alvarez wanted to file the impeachment case against Robredo but President Duterte put his foot down on it, hence the impeachment case did not prosper at the Lower House. Let me borrow Chu's words to describe Alvarez's forging an alliance with Leni Robredo, ""Hindi ka nya gusto, ginagamit ka lang nya."" Chu told Leni that because she feels not enough people like her she will accept anyone who wishes to court her. Chu reminded Robredo that women are better than this and she can relate to that. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Leni, sis, you're better than this. Tayong mga babae we don't allow ourselves to be used by men who disrespect us and then change their minds just because their first choice-in this case of Panty, Sara- don't want them and just stepped on their balls. Pantaleon Alvarez wanted you impeached and only PRRD asked people to stop with the Impeach Leni movement. Ginagamit ka, and just because feeling mo walang enough na may gusto sayo eh tatanggapin mo nalang kahit sinong nanliligaw sayo. Hindi ka nya gusto, ginagamit ka lang nya. We women are better than this. I can actually relate. Nung 2nd year high school ako gusto ko na sagutin yung ka isa isang nanliligaw sa akin kasi yun lang may gusto sa akin. Kahit napapangitan ako sa kanya at nayayabangan, at na cocornyhan at mali mali magsalita Basta kadiri sya. Buti nalang hindi ko sinagot. Kasi tumigil sya bago ko sya masagot. Ako pa yung nasayangan. Hay. Look at me sis. Don't allow this. ",1

Critics of the Leni-Kiko tandem wasted no time in coming up with their own interpretation of Kris Aquino's endorsement of Leni-Kiko tandem. Atty. Trixie of the Luminous commented on her FB page that Kris Aquino's endorsement of Leni Robredo for President runs counter to Robredo's pronouncement that she is running as an independent and not as LP.

Meanwhile, netizen # 3 belied that Tarlac is pink. Bakit iniinsist nila na ang tarlac ay pink. Taga Tarlac ako. Mga nagpunta doon sa rally nanggaling sa iba't ibang munisipalidad sa tarlac. Bawat munisipalidad may mga mangilan ngilan na nagpunta doon. Kapag pinagsama sama mo talagang makikita mo madami sila pero hindi ibibilang ang mga iyon sa mga bontante. Karamihan dito sa amin maka BBM. Isang family puro BBM at may maiba man paisa isa lang na makaleni, makaping, maka Manny. Pero halos lahat dito BBM. Yung iba silent lang. You may now read Atty. Trixie's brief FB post below. Kris Aquino's presence in the Tarlac pink rally gives the lie to Robredo's distancing to the yellow brand. Robredo ran as independent to have a shot at uniting the opposition. But its hard to take the yellow out of the pink veneer. Tapal lang talaga. ",1

Both of them compliment each other but neither would give up their ambition to support the other ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Leni Robredo and her supporters have always been quoted that the best man for the job is a woman. If you ask Davaoeno content creator and social media influencer Chito Samontina, Leni Robredo's campaign pitch is self-serving? In a Facebook post published this afternoon, Samontina isn't buying Robredo's catchy slogan. According to Samontina, the best man for the job is not a woman but a Filipino. Samontina wrote that regardless of gender, if you can't rally your people to work as one, or worse, promote disunity, you will never be fit for the job. Samontina believed that Filipinos are wiser now than before and knows how to choose a leader who put country above self-interest. Samontina urged Robredo to act Filipino not act like a saint. Samontina coaxed Robredo to organize rallied without the need to resort to badmouthing her rivals. Otherwise, the more she bark, she sounded more desperate. Looking at the 4,000+ reactions in just 5 hours, it seems Chito Samontina's message has hit the nail right on its head. Netizen #1 commented that the issue is not about the gender of the candidate but whether his/heart beats for the the general public not for the few with vested interest. The candidates qualifications is not about gender but who has the heart to listen, craft laws that's for the benefit of the general populace not for the few. A leader who works without bad mouthing anyone with or without the lenses of the camera. Netizen #2 shared a powerful saying for Robredo to ponder upon. Very well said! Louder kuys Chito Samontina ""As the saying goes; Blowing out someone else's candle doesn't make yours shine any brighter."" You may now read Samontina's original FB post below. The best man for a job is not a woman. The best man for a job is a Filipino. Whether you're a man or a woman, if you don't lead your people to work together or worse, encourage your people to hate, you will never be fit for the job. The Filipino people are no longer blind, they are now wise enough to determine a leader who prioritizes nation before self interest. ""Tayo"" dili ""ako"". Magpaka-Pilipino. Dili magpaka-santo. That's old school. Anyway, may we organize rallies without the need to bad-mouth other parties. Make it clean. The more you bark, the more you sound desperate. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"This staunch Sara Duterte supporter is on the warpath after the Robredo-Sara (ROSA) tandem has been floated around on social media by some groups from the Opposition. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu took to Facebook to offer her unsolicited advice to the people or groups behind this gimmick not to entertain the idea of Sara being Leni's VP because according to her, this may be the first time in history we will witness the President acting as the ""julalay"" or servant of the Vice President. Chu warned the supporters of Leni-Sara not to wish the two ladies to win as President and Vice President respectively because for sure they are in for an embarrassment. Why? That would be the day when the President will look like the secretary of the VP. And a very bad secretary at that because Leni is a slow learner? Chu predicted that after year, Leni will get ousted as President, leaving Sara as the President for the next 11 years. When that happens, Chu said they are like getting a rock and hitting their heads with it. Lastly, Chu said Leni won't win anyway even if Pope Francis is her VP stop so they better stop this non- sense. You may now read Chu's original FB post. Advice ko lang sa mga ambisyosang pilit kinakabit si Leni (15 percent) kay Sara (54 percent). Wag nyo nalang pangarapin maging Presidente ni Sara si Leni at baka for the first time in history makakita kayo ng Presidenteng naging julalay sa VP. Ikakapahiya nyo lang yan. Baka magmukhang Secretary ng VP ang Presidente. At hindi pa magaling na Secretary Kasi di mabilis maka pick up. Tapos after 1 year ma oust lang yan eh di maging 11 years si Sara as President. Para kayong kumuha ng Bato para iumpog sa ulo nyo. Tsaka di rin mananalo si Leni Kahit si Pope Francis yung ka tandem nya so stop this the meaning of this. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Did you know the supporters from the opposing camp has dismissed the photo of the meeting between BBM and PRRD circulating on social media fake or edited? Well, that's what happened according to Atty. Trixie of the Luminous when they posted the said photo on their page recently. To put an end to the debate whether the photo was fake or edited, Atty. Trixie took a screenshot of SMNI's FB post wherein Sandro Marcos addressed the same issue on Twitter. Netizens who read the FB post of Atty. Trixie of the Luminous have a field day making fun of the supporters of the opposing camp. Netizen #1 commented that he is curious how Banat By is taking the news.

Pinoy Trending News,"Social media influencer and writer of Manila Bulletin Krizette Chu believed that the true measure of the strength of the presidential candidate can be seen during the miting de avance and she can't wait for that day to come. Chu said that Pink rallies are attracting huge crowd because Leni's supporters are very dedicated. They are very eager to make sure BBM's victory is prevented. Chu conceded that almost all rallies of Leni-Kiko are well-attended because Kakampinks are so eager to show their strength and attend. Anywhere wherein a driving distance, expect a Kakampink to go there and make themselves counted. Chu concluded that having seen BBM's massive rally in Cavite, she is thrilled to see how the two parties will perform at the miting de avance. Here's how netizens react. Netizen #1 disagreed with Chu's assertion that miting de avance is the true measure of the strength of the support of presidential candidates. He said it's the caravan. Sa caravan na nagkakaalaman now kaso ayaw nila ng ganon gusto photo ops pa rin hahaha kasi nga naman nakahakot na sila non from all over driving distance sa location para dumog kuno hahaha tapos di naniniwala sa survey eh dito lang sami isurvey nila halos bbm lahat milang na milang lang ang mink hahaha This is echoed by another netizen who said a moving caravan is the test of the real strength of the supporters because people go out to see the presidential candidate and you can be sure they are really from that place. The same cannot be said of crowd in one venue wherein they can be easily brought in from other places by buses. Depende din kasi sa venue. I'm sure kung same venue, the Pinks will make sure na mapupuno nila, kasehodang manggaling pa ng Naga ang mga tao hahaha. Para sa akin, ang basehan talaga ay sa moving caravan. Dun mo makikita na lumalabas talaga ang mga tao to see the candidates, hindi yung hahakutin lang sila sa venue. Yung sa caravan kasi, yung mga taong yun mismo ay taga dun sa lugar. Netizen #2 agreed with Chu's assertion that Pink rallies are well attended, no jampacked because many fenks are enjoying the field trips. madami tlg umattend na mga Fenk... gawin ba nmn field trip destination ang Emerald Ave eh.. kaya sa May 9.wag kalimutan magsuot ng RED TSHIRT. baka mgkroon nnmn ng magic eh You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Madami ang Pinks sa rallies kasi dedicated sila kay Leni. Very frantic to make sure BBM doesn't win. Madaming kakampinks na halos lahat ng rally nag a-attend. Pasig, attend. QC, attend. Cavite, attend. Anywhere that's drivable distance, attend. You know saan magkaka alaman kung gaano talaga kalakas ang support? Sa miting de avance, kasi bawal umulit ng tao, malalaman ang totoong swell of the crowd. Having seen BBM's massive rally in Cavite, and that's just Cavite, I am excited to see how the two parties will fare come the final campaign rally. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In case you missed it, PDP-Laban just delivered some depressing news for BBM's rivals after PRRD's political party endorsed BBM's presidential bid. In the wake of this interesting turn of events, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu took to social media to remind DDS who are supporting BBM-Sara tandem that politics is addition and not subtraction. It is not who who is correct or wrong and who getting embarrassed... Basically, Chu argued that if the likes of Mocha, Vivian Velez and Byron aka Banat By and all those who jumped ship to Isko Moreno's camp wants to return to the fold after PDP-Laban endorses BBM, Chu asked a favor from DDS who are now pro-BBM not to ridicule or speak ill against Mocha and company. Otherwise, they are no different than the Kakampinks, said Chu. Chu defended Mocha and company, saying they are not to blame because nobody could guess who Duterte was going to endorse until the PDP-Laban announcement today. In fairness to PRRD, he has yet to raise BBM's hand officially but the pic shared by BBM and PRRD circulating on Facebook today, convinces majority of DDS, including known pro-Duterte bloggers that the PDP-Laban endorsement is as good as PRRD's endorsement of BBM. Finally, Chu said rejecting those DDS who have gone astray and wants to go back runs counter to the very message of the BBM-Sara tandem, which is UNITY. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post. Paalala ko lang ha. Paramihan ang election. Hindi kung sino yung tama o napahiya o sino ngayon yung mali. Kung gusto bumalik ni Mocha, ni Vivian Velez, ni Byron, at lahat nang nag Isko Moreno, WAG NIYONG PAPAHIYAIN O SASABIHAN NG MASAMA. Ano kayo, Kakampink? PRRD was very vague and nobody could guess who he was going to endorse til he really endorsed so don't blame them for choosing Isko because marami kaming anti BBM. I myself would have gone for Ping if he didn't say what he said about PRRD and Pnoy. So kung gusto nyo talaga ng UNITY gaya ng sinasabi ninyo, gusto nyo talaga ng madami tayo para super latak, WELCOME THOSE WHO WERE LED ASTRAY because wag niyong babalewain yung effort nila kay PRRD for the last 6 years. Wag kayong ganyan. Be careful not to become the monsters you fight. KUNG UNITY, UNITY. Unity is easy to achieve when you agree with all, but hard to actually embody during disagreements. Paaalala lang that your job is to welcome everybody in the fold, whoever they are. That is the essence of true UNITY. ",1

On that note, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes dared Pacquiao to attend the SMNI's ""The Deep Probe Presidential Debate"" and show BBM what he got. Reyes called out SMNI, asking the network not to give advance questions to add excitement to the debate because that is what Manny Pacquiao wants as per his statement yesterday. Reyes added that it would be better if presidential candidates are allowed to throw some questions at each other. Netizens jumped into the comment section, egging Pacquiao to accept the Reyes' dare.

Pinoy Trending News,"Veteran movie director and actor Manuel ""Manny"" Castaneda offered his personal opinion on the huge crowd that attended Leni-Kiko campaign rallies. Basically, Direk Manny described the contrasting attitude of the supporters of the BBM-Sara tandem vs Leni-Kiko tandem at this point in the campaign period. ""Laid back"". That's how Direk Manny described the attitude of the BBM-Sara supporters, mainly because of the favorable survey results of BBM-Sara tandem. Although, he called this attitude ""risky"" as well. On one hand, Direk Manny described the Leni-Kiko supporters like they are on a warpath, uber-aggressive in selling Leni-Kiko tandem on social media because they want to prove they are a force to reckon with and not get run over in the election. However, Direk Manny have bad news for the Kakampinks because as far as he is concerned, this huge crowd in Leni-Kiko campaign rallies already represents the entire 20% of Leni supporters in the surveys. Here are some of the comments from netizens below. Netizen #1 somewhat disagreed with Direk Manny that BBM supporters are confident. Instead, the BBM supporters are just more alert now than in 2016. Hindi naman confident Direk...mas alerto nga mga BBM supporters ngayon because of 2016. Pero sabi nga nila iba ang rally sa surveys. Alam ng Kakampinks na grabe ang lamang ni BBM sa kanila kaya they will do everything para mag mukhang marami sumusuporta... Netizen #2 agreed with Direk Manny's assessment on BBM-Sara vs Leni-Kiko supporters. A product that sells itself doesn't need advertising. On the contrary, a product that has caused misery and pain to the multitude will try everything they can to improve their rotten reputation.. only to win a vote.. Netizen #3 assured Direk Manny that BBM-Sara supporters are on the lookout to prevent the opposing camp from cheating their way to victory. We are always on the lookout Derek. Lahat ng mga balak nilang pag sabotahe at pandaraya binabantayan. Sa ngayon ung mga posters ni BBM nilalagyan ng #10...para ang mga no read no write n mga kababayan lilituhin at tandaan Ing ang numero. #10 is LENI..Kaya need mag rally sa mga supporters ni BBM wag nimber nag tandaan kundi hanapin at basahin ang pangalan. You may now read Direk Manny's original FB post. BBM/Sara supporters have been a bit laid back lately. Backed by very favorable survey results, they feel they have nothing to prove. Confident that BBM and Sara will win the elections. Better to sit back and relax and let everything fall into place. Can be a risky attitude though. Whereas, Leni supporters are on the warpath. They've pressed the panic button and are out to prove that they will not be trampled upon. They come in full force. And what we see is the whole 20% of what they have to offer. Yun na yun. Better still, hanggang dun na lang yun. ",1

Chu assured the Kakampink that her Mom has the credentials - dentistry board passer and did clinical hours as part of the school requirements. But here's the catch-after graduation, Chu said her mom never fixed a single tooth again, never held a drill in decades. Chu told pro-Leni netizens that if he/she thinks a no-case Leni is a good lawyer, then they have no qualms getting the services of her Mom as their dentist. Is Leni Robredo a no-case lawyer like Chu said? Rappler begs to disagree with Chu's assertion because in the article dated February 24, 2022, Robredo's nongovernmental organization, Sentro ng Alternatibong Lingap Panligal or Saligan, helped the Sumilon farmers in their land dispute against San Miguel Corporation. The Robredos walked for 6 kilometers with the farmers, who went on to complete their 1,700-kilometer, 60-day march to Malacañang and eventually reclaimed their land from San Miguel Corporation. The nongovernmental organization Leni belonged to, Sentro ng Alternatibong Lingap Panligal or Saligan, helped the farmers. ""Noong una pa man, kasama na namin siya. Hindi na siya iba sa amin (She's been with us since the early days. She's no stranger to us),"" said Bajekjek Orquillas, who was 21 in 2007 and the youngest of the 55 farmers who marched to Malacañang that year.

But since she graduated she's never fixed one single tooth. She's never held a drill in decades. But if you think no-case lawyer Leni is a good lawyer, you can also hire my Mama to fix your teeth. As i said, libre. Sya yung 8 years nag Dentistry tapos pag nag rereklamo akong masakit ang ngipin ko ang solusyon nya, ""Mag toothbrush ka."" PS: Chu was corrected by her Mom.

Pinoy Trending News,"Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu of the FB page KLC Happy Thoughts and Cellphone Repair is putting the blame Leni Robredo and fellow presidential candidates squarely for BBM's impending victory in the 2022 presidential polls. Chu remarked that if the current crop of presidential candidates are not dumb, they should have known that attacking PRRD is their ticket to Malacanang is a monumental blunder because of the PRRD admin's high approval ratings. In addition, Leni and her allies had been linked to oust-Duterte plot rumor (spreads black propaganda against the Duterte) with the aim of undermining the very popular Duterte among Filipinos for the last 6 years. Instead of succeeding, the result was the opposite. Chu said that if Leni and fellow presidential aspirants were thinking correctly, they should have not allowed BBM to emerge as only admin-leaning candidate. If I may add, Pacquiao, Isko and Ping were viewed early on as pro-Duterte but months before the official filing of candidacy, they started attacking PRRD, thus earning the ire of the DDS. Chu wrote that if Leni and fellow presidential aspirants played their cards right by playing the non- antagonistic path in dealing with PRRD, they could have given the public a pro-admin alternative to BBM, BBM would not have been this popular, making him the favorite to win 2022 presidential polls. Chu blamed the bloated egos of Leni Robredo and fellow presidential candidates by thinking they are smarter than PRRD. Kung hindi bobski ang mga kandidato, they should've seen that PRRD admin approval ratings are very high. Leni and company couldn't oust him. Instead they were the ones whose reputations got damaged as they tried to attack him over the past 6 years. Duterte's trust ratings never dipped below honeymoon period levels. He has the faith of the people. Kung nag iisip sila, they shouldn't have allowed BBM to be the only administration-leaning candidate. Kahit kaming mga ayaw kay BBM or sa Marcos name, walang choice kasi siya lang ang pro admin. Eh kung nag field sila ng isang candidate na pro admin din at mahal si PRRD, at walang sasabihing masama against kay PRRD, na strong ang personality at Di gaya ni BONG GO na masyadong sensitive pa at hindi talaga politiko kaya umatras agad, e di sana Hindi namamayagpag ng ganito si BBM kasi merong ibang admin candidates. Eh Wala, mas ma galing daw sila lahat kay PRRD. So tell me you're not smart without telling me you're not smart. ",1

Berenguer reminded Robredo what happened when her allies was in power? He cited the MRT as one in the long list of LP's (allies of Robredo) mismanagement. In addition, Berenguer also cited LRT as another classic example of the LP's failure to deliver their promises why the likes of him have doubts now when politicians like Robredo makes election promises and when they win the election, they can't deliver. Meanwhile, in the comment section of Berenguer's FB thread, netizens are making comments on Leni Robredo's preference of PPP over ODA (Overseas Development Assistance).

Thank you pa din VP Leni for visiting my beloved hometown. Good luck po sa Mayo. PS. The photos of the conversation are not mine but are relative to the boat drama of Leni Robredo. LENI ANG DRAMA MO0000000 This is how Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu reacted to photo tweet of ABS-CBN News reporter Jervis Manahan saying Leni Robredo arrived in Basilan on a boat. Netizens who stumbled upon Chu's FB post laughed at Chu's reaction. Turned out, Chu made that remarked in light of the FB post of a netizen from Basilan named Yusuf Dominic Garcia who debunked the tweet of Jervis Manahan who made it appear Leni Robredo arrived in Basilan on a boat. Although, Manahan did not say Robredo traveled on a small boat from Zamboanga City to Basilan, how he phrased his tweet left it open for misinterpretation. According to Garcia, Robredo took the motorized boat from the Fuego fuego beach resort to the Basilan port, just a short distance away from the said port. Garcia claimed that his uncle saw Robredo and her entourage arrived by speedboat and yacht and then transferred to the small boat before proceeding to Basilan port for dramatic impact? Garcia also posted the screenshots of the convo of fellow Basilenos talking about Robredo and the speedboat and yacht to corroborate his uncle's story. Garcia's claim about Robredo arriving via speedboat (no mention of yacht) is corroborated by a pro-Leni Robredo FB page and Basilan-based FB page named Isabela de Basilan.... March 16, 2022 - After a whirlwind campaign tour at Sultan Kudarat and Cotabato City, VP Leni and Senator Kiko arrived in Isabela de Basilan via speedboat at Fuego-Fuego, Tabiawan, where they disembarked and then joined a scheduled Bangkaravan with our local bangkeros. Some of those who joined the short bangkaravan were beneficiaries of her Angat Buhay program supporting local fisherfolk in the city - this is their simple way to say 'thank you' as well as to warmly welcome back someone who has helped them with their livelihood over the years. Our bangkeros then escorted VP Leni and company who then disembarked at the James W Strong Boulevard and proceeded to Plaza Rizal from there for the Salamat ulit #BasiLENlyo Grand People's Rally. VP Leni at Sen Kiko sa pagpapahalagang inyong binigay sa ating mga bangkero at mangingisda ng Isabela de Basilan. Kahit sa ganitong paraan man lang namin maiparating ang aming taos-pusong pasasalamat. #BasiLENlyo #sahayabasileniyo #KulayRosasAngBukas #rosasnaumaga #lenisabela #isabeleniyo #IpanaloNa10To Here are the comments of netizens in reaction to Chu's F post. This Basileno said that mode of transportation when going to Basilan is either by ferry boat or fast craft. Basilan is my province... missed its progress & development. Mode of transpo either ferry boat or fast craft only. The people here were honest & respectful. I believe those texted in 'chabacano' were true. Another commented that the moment she saw the banca pic, she smelled photo ops from a mile away. When I saw the banca pic, I instantly knew that it was another photo ops. The ""waiting for the bus where the bus never stops"" kinda thing. Actually the bus photo was the one that really changed my mind 180 deg in 2016 about Leni. Prior to that, I was considering voting for her. But when it was pointed out that the bus never stops in that area...boom! That one photo captured the hypocrisy of the Leni persona. After that, any news about her always seems fake, staged, puro illusions lang. This netizen can't help but ask why use a small boat when there are other means of transportation, to thin that Leni Robredo is a high government official. She compare it to the motorcycle angkas scenatio. There are witnesses. Again. Standard Operational Procedure. The military/armed forces along with the pulis always secure the highest ranking officials of the State. Bakit mo pasasakayin ng bangka if merong mas maayos na transportation? Dapat makarating sila ng ligtas at ibigay ang pinakamaayos na transportation. Katotohanan or palabas? This is similar to the motorcycle angkas scenario na nangyari. Entertaining, wrote another.

Pinoy Trending News,"On photos of vans, dump trucks and buses conveying hundreds if not thousands of people to the venue of Leni-Kiko campaign rallies, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes remarked on Facebook that this practice is not unusual in Philippine politics. Reyes said this is not new and surprising sight during election. Politicians have been doing this including event organizers for ages. Even the subversive groups do this when they have rallies in Mendiola, Luneta, EDSA and Ayala. The budget, Reyes said, is not also a joke. Reyes' beef is that Leni Robredo's camp insistence that ""hakot"" crowd does not exist in their camp while bragging at the same time that mostly, their rally attendees walk to reach the venue of their campaign rallies. Reyes figured that this behavior can only be explained in two ways: 1. They are clueless 2. Incorrigible liar Either way, Reyes said their denial of the allegation is even more alarming and she does not know either which is worse. Di naman na bago at di nakapagtataka ang mga ganitong pag hakot o pag provide ng transpo para mag attend ng rally. Gawain din naman yan noon pa ng iba pang mga pulitiko at ng kani-kanilang organizers. Gawain din at sanay na sanay dyan ang mga subersibong grupo tuwing may rally sa Mendiola, Luneta, Ayala, at EDSA. (Di rin biro ang budget dyan, ha.) Ang nakakapagtaka, nakakatawa, at nakakainis ay ang ipagpilitan pa na wala ka'ng nakitang mga vans, trucks, at buses na nagdala ng mga tao - at sa halip ay naglalakad lang talaga ang mga ito. Dalawa lang kasi ang ibig sabihin nun. Either: 1. You're clueless, o di kaya ay 2. Nuknukan sa kasinungalingan Alin man sa dalawa ay lubhang nakakabahala. I don't know which is worse. RORORO *** ict to orig photo owners As of this writing, Reyes' FB post has generated. Leni Robredo denying hakot crowd in Leni-Kiko campaign rallies.  ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Perhaps out of sheer desperation because of BBM's insurmountable lead in all social weather surveys, some Pinklawans are spreading the narrative on social media sites that BBM will cheat in the elections to win over Leni Robredo. Direk Manny Castaneda reacted on Facebook that this narrative is ridiculous as the 711 script of Valentine Rosales. Castaneda remarked that the favorite to win as per all presidential polls are concerned will cheat to win the election defies logic and common sense. What makes sense is the candidate who is doing poorly in the presidential polls will try to cheat his or her way to victory. Here's how netizens react to Castaneda's FB post. This netizen noted that Leni Robredo supporters are victims of Leni Robredo's own mind conditioning game based on the screenshots of silly contents of the Leni app she has seen on social media. The mind conditioning game of Leni's camp is so strong sa mga supporters nila. For example, I've been seeing screenshots of the contents ng Leni app nila - the wordings, statement are beyond imaginable. There's a part there na ayaw daw ng gobyerno kay Leni, hindi sya binigyan ng budget so lahat ng tulong nya ay mula sa private sector pero very contradicting naman yung pinagmamalaki nilang 'highest audit rating' I mean, you get that COA audit rating because you are a public official managing a specific amount of budget (from the govt) handed over to her office diba? (please correct me if I'm wrong). Basta, sobrang lala. Kaya no wonder why andaming nauuto - I have no better word to use. Understandable yung mga ayaw sa Marcos dahil sa Martial Law at ayaw kay Duterte kasi pala-mura, etc. but the kind of trash Leni's camp has been feeding to her supporters is absolutely daft. No wonder. Another netizwn expressed agreement with Direk Manny's Castaneda observation that many Leni supporters lack common sense. Agree ako sa yo Direk! Saan ba nabibili yang common sense at ipamumudmud ko sa kabilang parlor. Yung nangungulelat sa survey at naghahasik ng kadiliman. To which another commenter agreed: Pinklawans were absent when deductive and inductive reasoning was discussed in their classroom days. You may now read Direk Manny Castaneda's brief FB post. Yung tagilid manalo ang maaring makapag-isip na mandaya, hindi yung may malaking chances na manalo. Common sense lang naman, di ba? The narrative being released by the pinklawans that the most favored candidate will cheat in the elections is as ridiculous as the 7/11 script of Valentine Rosales. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Elizabeth Oropesa or Jacqueline Elizabeth Freeman in real life complained on Facebook that she was bashed for simply commenting. The late PRESIDENT MARCOS IS ""MY"" HERO.

Freeman's FB post has generated 7,400 reactions, 802 comments and 75 shares in just 10 hours and counting. Many netizens expressed sympathy or support for Elizabeth Freeman as shown in the comments below. Netizen #1 commented she loves Elizabeth Freeman and wished all learn to respect other people.

Netizen #2 also expressed her support for Elizabeth Freeman. We love you madam Dra. Basta solid BBM tayong lahat.

I agree po..my father was a police colonel under FEM...until now po our loyalty is with the Marcoses...and magaling talaga c late President FEM.i admire him so much..un lng maraming bastos talaga at walang pinag aralan n mga tao.. Another netizen also said he considered FEM as hero like Ms. Elizabeth Freeman but she is not bother if the anti-Marcos bashed her. Same sentiments here Miss. Elizabeth. But I am not bothered, sabi ko nga sa kanila, bring it on! I stand firm with what I believed, FEM (Apo Lakay) is The BEST PRESIDENT WE EVER HAD. I even told them look at those accomplishments. It can't even be equated with the total accomplishments of all other presidents. I consider him a Hero. Why? Because his decision to declare Martial law ensured that our country will never fall under NPA/communist takeover. Martial law save us from evil communism. And that's the main reason of yellows and red's hatred towards him. He single handedly stopped the terrorists and ambitious, greedy politicians from assuming the government. Some netizens advised Ms. Elizabeth to ignore the bashers. Ignore them. Stand pat on what you believe in. Nobody can take that away from you. Remember you're the ""Captain of your soul, the Master of your fate!"" Wag mo nlng pansinin po. Not worth your energy and time. They have so much anger in their hearts.. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Senator Ping Lacson told GMA News that a mediator from Leni Robredo camp approached him, asking him to withdraw his candidacy so that Robredo will only be facing BBM in the election. In light of this explosive revelation from Lacson, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu remarked that her eyes rolled so hard that her contact lenses can't keep up while listening to the news report, eliciting laughter among her FB followers. In fact, out of the 6,800 reactions her post generated, 4,300 netizens hit the laugh emoji. Lacson: Para daw labanan si Bongbong, mas malaki ang chance. Ano ang ibig sabihin nun? Sabi ko tumakbo kami para magsilbi, hindi mamunterya ng tao. (To contest Bongbong and to give Robredo a fighting chance. What does it mean? Lacson said he told the mediator that he run in order to serve, not to target other people.) With regards to Lacson's revelation, Chu commented that Leni and LP is inseparable and that's how they works. Electing Leni means electing the entire LP back to power. For that, Lacson's revelation and for standing his ground earned him the respect of netizens. Netizen #1 lauded Lacson for not selling his principle. Despite lacson's lesser credibility, at least he has principle. Takbo lang para maglingkod, hindi para mag bengga ng tao... gayahin mo na leni, tutal pareho naman kayong talo. Baka next time, iboto ka na talaga ng tao. Tanga ka talaga!!!! This is echoed by netizen #2 who praised Lacson for having the balls. At least si senator lacson may balls, may prinsipyo, mga kampon ni Lenlen mga Lutang mangarap at Hindi na magising kaylan man grabe ampait ng apdo kakausapin mga kalaban para umatras, parang grace po at Roxas lang Netizen #3 also agreed with the observation of netizen #2 that this also reminds him of Roxas asking Grace Poe to slide down and join forces to stop the Duterte juggernaut in 2016. Desperate moves, panic mode just like Roxas Meanwhile, this netizen offered an intriguing theory why the Robredo camp wants Lacson to withdraw in favor of Robredo. Actually, pinapa andar yan ng kabilang parlor kasi gusto nila patahimikin yung kampo ni Ping Lacson tungkol sa issue ng mga communists sa mga political rally ni Len Len. Syempre kapag pumayag si Kakamping sa modus nila (IF lang naman, di naman po lutang si Ping Lacson katulad ng Ina nila), tatahimik na lang si Ping sa issue ng reds in Leni's camp kasi magka-kasabwat na kasi sila. Postscript: Atty. Barry Guiterrez, Leni Robredo’s Spokesman issued a statement denying the Robredo camp sent an “official” emissary to mediate with other presidential candidates for a possible unification scenario. In light of this statement, we can say that it’s either Ping Lacson is lying or Leni Robredo. Take your pick.  ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On insinuation Leni Robredo is forming a coalition government with communist groups, the Vice President fired back that her critics and presidential rivals are simply trying to halt the momentum of what she called People's campaign. The Vice President taunted rivals to try harder. Or better yet, why not join her? Let us win this together, Robredo said. On that note, the Luminous wasted no time in slapping Leni Robredo's face with the cold reality that her presidential bid is sadly not what Robredo thinks, that is gaining momentum but the truth is, it's the complete opposite. On Leni Robredo vehemently denying allegation of forming a coalition with the Communist? By the tone of her voice, Atty. Trixie of the Luminous isn't satisfied of Leni Robredo merely issuing denial statements. Instead, Atty. Trixie wants Robredo to issue a statement condemning the communist groups and its legal fronts. Because public interest calls for an end of the communist groups in the country. And as the Vice President who is hoping to succeed President Duterte, she is supposed to champion public interest. Finally, Atty. Trixie told Robredo that bragging about momentum of so-called People's Campaign won't distract her and like-minded netizens. Leni Robredo's desperate attempt to project that her presidential bid is snowballing is a non-issue. The main issue according to Atty. Trixie is peace and order because it is public interest. Robredo's pathetic propaganda and election campaign isn't public interest. You may now read Atty. Trixie's original FB post below. Wala po kaming nakikitang momentum ninyo madame, maliban lang sa downward trajectory ng inyong satisfaction ratings. Gayunpaman, hindi ba dapat lahat tayo interesado sa pagtitigil at pagpipigil sa mga communist terrorist groups? Hindi ba dapat kinokondena natin ang mga ito, at hindi tayo nakikipag alyado sa kanila at sa kanilang mga kaalyado din sa labas ng kanilang rebelyon? Hindi mo kami madidistract sa pagyayabang na ito. Hindi isyu ang desperation ninyong magmukhang angat. Peace and order natin ang interes dito. Hindi yung pathetic propagdanda at kampanya ninyo. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Veteran film director and actor Manny Castaneda announced on Facebook why Leni Robredo isn't going to get his vote for President in the 2022 presidential polls for sure. The backstory behind this is that, some people have been asking him to reveal his presidential choice. But the question is: Will the revelation end people from asking who is his presidential bet? IMO? Nope. Moving forward, Castaneda cited 6 reasons why anyone but Leni for him in this 2022 presidential polls. Reason #2 in Castaneda's list why he is not voting for Leni Robredo, in my opinion, is the most damaging allegation against the presidential bid of Vice President Leni Robredo. Of course, Leni Robredo is not going to allow this talks about allegation of communist links to slow down her ""momentum"", by issuing a denial statement asap in a Facebook post, dated March 13, 2022. Here's an excerpt of Robredo's statement on Facebook: Yung mga talagang kilala ako, alam na hindi ako naniniwala sa dahas para solusyonan ang anumang problema. Alam na tutol ako sa sinumang pumupulot ng armas para maggiit ng sariling agenda. Hindi ako makikipag-alyansa sa mga ganun or sa mga naniniwala dun. Priority ko ang magtrabaho sa mapayapang paraan para sa dignidad ng bawat tao, ang empowered and responsible exercise of freedoms, at ang fairness. You may now read Manny Castaneda's original FB post below. I've been asked a couple of times kung bakit ayaw ko kay Leni Robredo. Well, here are my random thoughts on the matter. Mga opinion ko lamang po ito bilang isang citizen at botante. May kanya kanya tayong pananaw at ito ang akin. 1. Wala akong tiwala sa politiko na may anino ng mga Aquino. Kahit baguhin man ang kulay ng kaniyang grupo o partido, alam ng lahat na sila ay mga Dilawan pa rin. Nasa ilalim pa rin sila sa insignia ng Liberal Party. Wag nilang iisipin na uto-uto ang mga tao para maniwala sa kanilang panlilinlang. Kung bakit ayaw ko sa mga Aquino, ibang topic na po yun. 2. Si Leni Robredo ay isang communist symphatizer. She has shown this on many occasions kaya hindi po ito fake news. Ang mga komunista ay isa sa mga puno't dulo ng gulo dito sa Pilipinas kaya ayaw ko sa mga komunista, ayaw ko sa mga leftists at ayaw ko rin kahit sa mga symphatizers lamang. Lahat ng mga yan ay salot ng bayan. Ang mga komunista ay kalaban ng bayan, no ifs or buts. Their main objective is to take over government kaya hindi rin sila dapat pinagkakatiwalaan. At hindi ko pakakatiwalaan ang sino mang makikipag- ugnayan sa mga komunista. 3. Sinabi ni Robredo na handa siyang tumakbo sa pagka pangulo para tapatan si Bongbong Marcos. Apparently, hindi pala para sa bayan. It may have just been a Freudian slip but is definitely reflective of her TRUE feelings and intentions. Galit kay Bongbong ang umiral, hindi ang pagmamahal sa bayan. 4. She is incompetent! Her very low performance and satisfaction ratings are proof of this. No further explanation needed. 5. Like Mar Roxas, ang hilig niyang umepal which is a big turnoff. Her term as VP is dotted with cheap and sometimes even disgusting gimmickries with the intention of enhancing or improving her image but fails every step of the way. Obvious naman na kaplastikan lahat yun. Lately ay lagi niyang ipinamamalaki sa mga rallies na siya ang unang government officials na dumadating sa mga disaster areas. Bakit? Dapat ba may karera ng mga government officials papunta sa mga disaster areas? Ganun ba ang labanan? The fact is, ang unang dumadating ay ang mga tauhan ng DSDW as ordered by the president and part of the protocol of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Manange Council. So, bago pa man din dumating si Robredo ay na-organize na ang relief operations ng government. Then, tsaka pa lamang sisipot si Robredo, bitbit ang sangkatutak na media at magpapapicture habang namimigay ng konting ganito at konting ganyan. 6. Kapansin-pansin din na ""substandard"" ang intellectual capacity ni Robredo para maging pangulo. To make a long story short, mahirap para sa akin na tanggapin ang isang pangulo na hindi nalalaman ang pagkaiba ng nerve sa vein. Ilan lamang ito sa mga dahilan kung bakit ayaw ko kay Leni Robredo. Tsaka na ang iba at hahaba lang ang usapan. To be honest, hindi pa po ako fully decided kung sino ang dapat kong iboto. Mayroon na po ako napupusuan pero ipaubaya nyo muna sa yun akin, pinag-aaralan ko pa rin ng mabuti. Dapat tandaan, isa lang ang ating boto kaya dapat tama ang pipiliin natin. Pero sigurado akong ayaw ko kay Robredo. At wag na po natin isali sa usapan si Pacquiao. Matagal ko na siyang binura sa listahan. Maraming salamat po. ",1

(Below was the photo used by News5 when filing the report that 10K people attended the Leni-Kiko campaign in Isabela.) News5 said 10,000 people attended the Leni-Kiko campaign rally in Isabela. Well, this is not accurate, commented a netizen who introduced himself as the hired photographer of the Leni-Kiko team for Facebook live feed coverage in the Echague, Isabela campaign rally. In addition, he is also the official media documentary officer of their municipality under the Information's Office. Philip Ceasar Canaria Cadabuna, the hired photographer, began by claiming the photo as his. He said the photo was taken as part of the municipal record for crowd checking purposes. Done shot video of the Isabela campaign rally of Leni-Kiko tandem, courtesy of Tiktok. Cadabuna revealed they always take this kind of shot (drone shot) since they often host huge festivals in their town. Cadabuna clarified he has no intention of destroying people's reputation or whatever. What he wants is the truth. How could I make a report unless I have the actual crowd estimated shot? Cadabuna asked. Besides, numbers don't lie he said. Cadabuna revealed that his estimate was 4,000-5000 people in the Municipal grounds. Cadabuna was puzzled where did News5 get their 10K, 20K, 40K crowd estimate! I Cadabuna shared another photo of his taken during either Bamboo or Parokya ni Edgar's concert in the same venue, saying this is how 10K-12K crowd looks like from above. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. One netizen commented that she was not surprised by turnout of the crowd because March 18 and 19 is fast approaching, fiesta of Echague, Isabela so there are plenty of pre-fiesta activities, especially on weekends. It is expected people will descend on the event, especially when there are celebrities. Ms MJ, magfi-fiesta kasi dito sa amin, sa Echague, Isabela ngayung 18 or 19 March kaya maraming pre activities sa Echague Bancheto lalo na pag weekends. Talagang dinudumog ng mga tao yan lalo na pag merong mga artista o sikat na singers/banda. Karamihan ng mga tao anjan sa ""10k"" estimate nila, ay hindi si Lenlen, este Leni ang pinuntahan kundi ang mga bitbit nyang entertainers na isang dozena. Magaling mag scout ng dates ang team nila, mabuti na lang January ginaganap ang sinulog, ati-atihan, dinagyang, black Nazareno, etc., kundi itataon nila kampanya sa mga lugar na yan at aangkinin ang size ng crowd. Remember drone shots of people with minimal light like during night time are the easiest to manipulate digitally, commented another netizen.

Chu was referring to the biggest political rally/concert that happened last night, March 11, 2022 to rival the Super Bowl and the BTS concert in 2021. Chu explained the need for Guinness World Records to fly to the Philippines and verify if indeed the political rally/concert last night held in a sports stadium named Paglaum (Bacolod City, Negros Occidental) managed to top the Super Bowl and the BTS concert with 70,000 people in attendance as reported by organizers of the Leni-Kiko political rally and echoed by CNN Philippines and almost all local major TV networks. Netizens joined Chu in calling the attention of Guinness to probe and if proven true, deserved a space in their record books as shown in the comments below. One netizen asked Guinness to double-check the claims of local major news outlets that Robredo's politically rally was attended by no less than 70,000 people. If indeed this was true, this is worthy to be included in their prestigious record book. Please, Guinness World Records, kindly double-check. All our major news outlets are declaring the same thing -- 70,000 people were able to fit in a 4-hectare space. If this is a World Record indeed, then this is worth taking note of. Thank you very much. Another netizen echoed the sentiment of the above commenter. Guinness World Records please check. It's going to be our proud moment. I want to know if it's true. I'm from Negros and I didn't know that we have a stadium that can accommodate 70K attendees. Thank you in advance!!!

Dear Guinness World Records, since our fact checkers won't do or say anything, please come to the PH and investigate a proud moment we want to include in your records-biggest political concert (not rally, but concert of some of the biggest stars) happened last night to rival the Superbowl and the BTS concert. Both major events (Superbowl and BTS) had 50,000 to 70,000 people but last night, a political concert held in a much much much smaller venue than SoFi stadium, a sports area named Paglaum, held in a city in the Visayas, was able to hold an even bigger event than the Super Bowl and the BTS concert. Amazing!!!!! Snoop Dog can never. Proud Filipino here and hope you can investigate this event so we can include this in the Guinness World Records.

Pinoy Trending News,"A Leni Robredo supporter started a thread on social media asking a hypothetical question to netizens whether they would ride an airplane knowing the pilot has no experience and diploma? If it were him, he won't even if he knew the father of the said pilot was also an excellent pilot. Although the OP did not mention any names, it is very obvious, he was alluding to a presidential candidate whose college diploma has been questioned by his critics. On that note, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu took to Facebook to respond to Manlapaz's hypothetical question. According to Chu, if she were to choose between two pilots, both inexperienced - she would go for the inexperienced pilot whose father was a good pilot. The reason being, he would have at least seen growing up how his father flew the plane and some of it would be memory for him. (Let us assume the father flew a non-commercial plane and took the son during one of his flights and showed him a thing or two about flying. This is not far-fetched in real life. But commercial planes? I don't think it is allowed as per company rules. Or even our CAAP rules.) In other words, the inexperienced pilot who grew up watching his father flew an airplane is a much better choice than the pilot who did not learn from her father, with doubtful calculation skills, dumb and thought the Philippines only have 1,700 islands that's why she would probably land on water due to miscalculation of the approach, either way, all passengers would be dead for choosing the wrong pilot. Chu said she would choose the pilot who is not dumb. Kung dalawang piloto na lang talaga ang pagpipilian ko-parehong walang experience at all-dun ako sa piloto na magaling yung Tatay because he would have at least seen growing up how his father flew the plane and some of it would be memory for him. Kesa dun sa walang alam talaga na piloto, tapos di marunong mag compute at all kasi bobo tapos Akala nya 1,700 islands lang nasa ilalim niya tapos nag landing sya sa tubig Kasi di sya marunong mag compute --or di kaya nag landing sya sa mountain kasi Akala nya walang island dun, kasi pagkaka alam nya 1700 Islands lang Meron, either way TEGI TAYO LAHAT. Dun ako sa hindi bobo. Ok na? ",1

The comedy queen uses several hashtags like #panahonpanimatusalemangpicturenayan #iwantpeace #iwantunity #silenceisdeadly to end the IG post. Netizens who read VOVph's post have mixed reactions on the issue, but mostly negative against the Kakampinks. What the Kakampinks have done to Ai-ai is really embarrassing. Nakakahiya talaga ang ginawa ng mga lutang n pinklawans sa yo Ai Ai... This netizen lamented that the Kakampinks are trying to associate with Leni all wearing pink or all pinks, not even sparing international brand which was forced to issued a statement denying the political affiliation of their brand. Lahat na lang ng Pink at nakaPink kinakapit kay Leni Meron din isang international brand ang naglabas ng statement that their Pink color is not related to any political matter This netizen isn't surprised what the Kakampink supporter have done to Ai-ai. Lahat nalang gagamitin for their political ""advantage"" si Cher na hindi botante at si Ms. Ai-Ai delas Alas na HINDI boboto kay mamafink.. ouch!

Pinoy Trending News,"A campaign ad video of Edu Manzano talking about the West Philippine Sea and Leni Robredo is the only leader who will make sure what is ours is ours, ""ang atin ay atin"". In the video, Manzano opened by praising the country's beauty. That wherever he and partner Cherry Pie traveled, they said nothing compared to our very own country, especially our seas. Almost 80% of the Philippines is surrounded by the sea, including the West Philippine Sea which is 3.5 million sq. km, rich with natural resources. Manzano said that the West Philippine Sea check all the boxes like food, livelihood and one of the country's richest in terms of natural resources. That is why there some countries who are stealing it from the Philippines. Foreigners who are harassing our fishermen as if we have no right to enjoy our own natural resources, which he said does not tick our boxes. Manzano said that the Philippines need to fight for what is ours. And with that, we need a leader who is ready to fight for what is ours. This is what Leni Robredo said about the West Philippine Sea. That is why some of our retired members of the Armed Forces have expressed their belief that VP Leni Robredo is the only leader who is capable, intellect and courage to become President and Commander-in- Chief, Manzano bragged. Manzano insisted, Robredo will fight for the Philippines for Filipinos. With Leni Robredo, we are certain, what is ours is ours, a confident Manzano said. On that note, International Relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot took to Facebook to ask Edu Manzano if he read the South China Sea Arbitration because he made a convincing pitch that Leni Robredo is the only one who can resolve the WPS issue. Si Edu Manzano ay may commercial na sinasabi na si Leni raw ang maka-resolba ng WPS issue. Ninanakaw raw ng dayuhan ang WPS. Sir Edu, nabasa nyo po ba ang South China Sea Arbitration decision? Sasot's FB post asking Edu Manzano if he really what he was talking about made 8,000+ laugh out of the 11,000+ reactions of netizens. ",1

Netizens offered their personal opinion/guesses to Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu's in relation to her questions, hoping to quench her thirst for answers as to why Leni-Kiko tandem caravans are not crowd drawers in contrast to the BBM-Sara tandem who are warmly greeted wherever they go.

Pinoy Trending News,"Jan Writer, Political writer and instructor of Political Science and International Relations, shared his brilliant read why Leni Robredo's presidential bid isn't catching fire because of one big flaw in their campaign strategy. Basically, Jan Writer said Leni's campaign strategy is quite obvious. Remember the Doctors for Leni, Nurses for Leni, Lawyers for Leni and so on and so forth expressing support one after the other for Robredo? The Robredo camp enlist these groups in the hope that their support and influence will be translated into public support. According to Jan Writer, their plan is anchored on a weak premise solely because of lack of understanding of their own the Filipino culture. In addition, Jan Writer blamed the so-called Catholic ideals and their emphasis on materialism, that is why there is always a clash between the rich and the poor in Catholic countries. That explains why Communism is common in many Catholic nations. You may continue reading Jan Writer's original FB post below. Leni's campaign strategy is quite predictable: enlist the support of the upper crust (doctors, lawyers, actors, business people, ""intellectuals,"" and so on) in the hopes that their support and influence will be translated into public support. The plan's weakness, as is typical of them, is their lack of comprehension of their own national culture. As a result of so-called Catholic ideals and their emphasis on materialism, there is always a friction between the elite and the poor in Catholic countries. This is why communism is so prevalent in many Catholic nations. In these countries, the elite class is often seen as oppressors rather than friends. As a result, when these elites force their political beliefs and attitudes on the general public, animosity and resentment only rise. For many Filipinos-as sentimental as we are as a nation-their political convictions are all they have. They will not allow it to be taken away from them. Most certainly not by the elites. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Senator Manny Pacquiao's ""Pacquiao hindi magnanakaw"" new campaign slogan has been met with angry reactions from BBM supporters. Senator Pacquiao released a photo of him on social media proudly pointing at the sticker with his campaign slogan on the side of an SUV. The senator and presidential aspirant said this is message he wants to convey to the voters. While Pacquiao did not name names, BBM supporters like Engr. Benjie Jr Contreras interpreted Pacquiao's slogan as a jab at BBM. On that note, Contreras took to Facebook to turn the tables around by borrowing Pacquiao's logic but with a twist. Contreras asked Pacquiao if the hours he was supposed to be working in the senate but he spent it training in the gym when has an upcoming fight isn't also stealing? Contreras ended the brief FB post telling Senator Pacquiao not to pull that kind of stunt because he has been exposed for some time now. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. This netizen echoed Engr. Contreras' line of thinking that Pacquiao's absences from his senate duties because of boxing is a form of stealing. Langhiya itong pala-Absent na ito. Di ba nakaw din yun kasi sumu-sweldo ka kahit di ka pumapasok? At huwag mong i-dahilan na inaasikaso mo ang mga constituents mo. Kasi panay training ka lang sa boxing ang inatupag mo kahit nangako ka na iiwan mo na yun. O sinungaling ka rin hahaha. To which another netizen agreed... Sa dami ng absent mo sa senado, pati sa kongreso dati, tapos mga pork barrel na inallocate sau di man lang napakinabangan ng mga bumoto sau kasi palagi kang wala dahil inuna mo ang sport mo kesa trabaho mo. Pagnanakaw sa kaban ng bayan yun. And another... Oo nga no binabayadan sya bilang senator magnanakaw ng oras he lagi absent You may read Engr. Contreras' brief counter punch at Senator Pacquiao. Hindi daw magnanakaw si Pacquiao. Yong oras niya bilang senador na dapat magtrabaho sa Senado, hindi ba ninakaw niya tuwing may training siya para sa laban niya sa boxing? Huwag kami Manny. Bistado ka na matagal na. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On Facebook, movie director and veteran actor Manuel Castaneda said he is thinking of voting for Leni Robredo this May, instead of his original choice. Instead of getting bashed for his statement, Direk Manny's FB post has been met with laughter among his followers. If you've been following Direk Manny on Facebook, you will have known by now he is a staunch Duterte supporter and a rabid anti-Leni Robredo. So what gives? Actually, Direk Manny confessed that all the candidates for Presidents that he voted for in the past since 1992 election lost. He said he felt his vote is cursed. Direk Manny figured Robredo supporters won't get mad at him since he is voting for their presidential bet and at the same time, BBM supporters or any other candidate because they will be spared from his cursed. Here are the reactions of netizens as shown in the comments. This Leni supporter appealed to Direk Manny to stick to his original choice. Stick ka nalang sa totoong iboboto mo para sa kanya na yung sumpa ng boto mo. Huwag mo na idamay si VP Leni. However, this Leni supporter believed the curse will lose its effect because Leni is the daughter of God. Mawawala ang sumpa sayo kasi iboboto mo si leni na anak ng diyos may puso sa kapwa lalo na sa mahihirap ikaw pagpapalain ng panginoon hessus kasi tama ang ibonoto mo. This BBM supporter gives Direk Manny the blessing to vote for Leni if that means his curse will be passed on to Leni and resulted in BBM victory. Go po please, if that is the only way for BBM to win go and vote for leni, just make sure you still have the sumpa. You may read Direk Manny's original FB post below now. Baka si Robredo po ang aking iboboto this May. Lahat ng mga binoto ko para sa pagka-presidente simula 1992 ay natalo. Feeling ko may sumpa ang aking boto. Hindi magagalit sa akin ang mga pinklawan dahil manok naman nila ang iboboto ko. Matutuwa sa akin ang mga BBM o ang iba pang mga kandidato dahil sa iba ko ipapasa ang sumpa.

Pinoy Trending News,"A Leni Robredo supporter was making fun at Juliana Parizcova Segovia, the gay actor who stars in the ""Lenlen"" viral videos written and directed by Darryl Yap of the VinCentiments fame. On Twitter, Roque Rox Santos tweeted that the Marcos camp is having a hard time hiring the services of artist as endorsers no matter how much is the offer because they were declined. Good thing, Julian accepted BBM's camp offer. Good choice, Santos praised BBM camp for making the cjoice in a sarcastic tone. On that note, political blogger Noel Landero Sarifa quickly brushed aside the sarcastic remark of the Leni supporter directed at BBM and Juliana Parizcova Segovia. Sarifa responded that BBM-Sara alone are crowd drawers. If his candidate needs an artist to attract peoplem, his candidate is incompetent. Hindi naman kailangan ng artista para dumugin, BBM and Sara alone attract crowds. If kailangan ng kandidato mo ng artista para dumugin ng tao, e incompetent nga. Netizens jumped into the comment section to share their thoughts on the issue. This netizen reminds the Robredo supporter what happened to Mar Roxas despite enjoying the support of many local artists. History would also support that Mar had the most artista endorsements in 2016 but did not win against a Rodrigo Duterte! Caravan and Rally ito hindi variety show and concert! commented another netizen. A BBM-Sara supporter wrote that they can have all the artists on their side but BBM-Sara will have the support of the public. Inyo n lahat ng artista! Magsama kayo! Kmi mga taumbayan para kay bbm, d kailangan ng artista ni bbm, kawawa kayo kulelat sa survey khit sandamakmak na concert pa gawin nyo.. Another netizen commented that the statement of the Kakampink supporter is akin to admitting that Juliana is more popular than the artist endorsers of the Leni-Kiko team. Naku si Juliana lang ang artistang nakuha nang BBM SARA tandem pero dinudumog nang mga tao.. Ibig ba sabihin nito ang mga artistang nakuha nang LIKO team ay mas mababa pa ang kasikatan kay juliana? at kung pagbasehan naman natin ang kandidato. Ibig sabihin nito marami talagang sumusuporta sa BBM SARA team. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A netizen named Jay Padriaga reposted a Tiktok video on Facebook to alert fellow netizens that on March 4, over a hundred buses were parked outside a subdivision near the General Trias Sports Park to the surprised of residents. Padriaga can only ask where do the passengers of the bus came from? He warned netizens to refrain from making allegation that the crowd was ""hakot"". Perhaps, it was just a coincidence, Padriaga wrote. Now it can be told. Last Friday, March 4, over a hundred buses parked outside the Bellavista Subdivision in Cavite, which is just 140 meters away from the General Trias Sports Park, surprising its residents. Taga saan kaya ang mga sakay ng mga bus na ito? Wala lang mag-aakusang may naghakot ha! Baka nagkataon lang. On insinuation the huge crowd that attended Leni Robredo's campaign rally in Gen. Trias Sports Park and elsewhere were ""hakot"", Atty. Barry Gutierrez, the Vice President's spokesman has something to say about this. Gutierrez: Many people have expressed on social media, in interviews with media that they went to Robredo's campaign rally out of their own volition... Thus who attended Robredo's rally even walked just to reach the event venue. The crowd was not ""hakot"" or transported. Here are some of the comments from Robredo supporters defending the Vice President from insinuation it was hakot crowd that filled her campaign rally in Gen. Trias Cavite. One netizen said the shuttle buses were courtesy of bus liners who volunteered to ferry the supporters to the venue. Sir, with all due respect. Mga shuttle buses yan from several pickup points for supporters na walang sasakyan and for volunteers from volunteer centers. Nagsponsor ang Jasper jean ng bus at isang volunteer ng 10 buses para maghatid sa venue. Pwede ko po isa-isahin kung saan yung mga pick up points. Mukha ka naman pong educated. Stop spreading misinformation. This seconded by another netizen. Yung mga buses po diyan karamihan ay pinahiram ng Jasper Jean. Yung iba namang volunteers nagambagan para may free ride sa walang masakyan. Hindi po yan hakot, ang tawag diyan ay libreng sakay. Walang ginastos kampo ni Leni diyan. Puro donations and efforts ng volunteers. Di namin kasalanan na walang mag effort na magbigay ng free transpo sa ibang kampo. Stop spreading misinformation. Another netizen says the video of parked buses does not prove the allegation. A video showing the supporters of Leni Robredo embarking and disembarking the buses would have been convincing. dapat vinideo habang nag sasakay o bumababa mga tao kasi mas nakakapaniwala parang wala nmn makitang tarpaulin... medyo may duda yan dapat nakita mismo mga supporters ni madam na sumasakay o bumababa.50/50 aq dito ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of Senator Ping Lacson's statement about a politician who is making a pact with the CPP-NPA- NDF, former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile immediately went to Facebook to sound the alarm bells. Enrile warned that the politician who is in bed with the CPP-NPA-NDF is a clear and present danger to the liberties of our people. He should be repudiated/rejected right away to occupy and hold any political position of authority in the country. Enrile told Filipinos to be very careful and beware. Here are some of the comments from netizens in the wake of JP Enrile's warning. This netizen commented that their kinds are growing in numbers by day. These includes senators, President and Vice President and party list. If they succeed, Filipinos are surely miserable. Padami na sila mapa senador, presidente at mapa vice hanggang sa partylist kapag napagtagumpayan nila iyan kawawa ang mga pilipino pagnagkataon. Sa kaparian na nga mukhang meron na. Sa isang channel station may mga anak ng mga makakaliwa. Nagkalat na at hindi rin natin alam na baka magulat na lang tayo meron na rin pala sa bawat sangay ng gobyerno ay may makapasok na rin. Na mga red tagged. To netizens asking for clue who was alluded by Senator Enrile, this netizen offered a tip how to identify the said politician. Very easy to identify. It is the candidate with leftists and communists in his/her senatorial lineup. Also, the candidate who is endorsed by the makabayan bloc. You may read JP Enrile's original FB post below. Senator Ping Lacson said on Facebook that a politician of this democratic country wants a coalition government with the CPP-NPA-NDF. That politician is a clear and present danger to the liberties of our people. He should be repudiated right away to occupy and hold any political position of authority in our country. He or she is actually advocating the subjugation of our country by a totalitarian system of government. That politician wants our country to be like North Korea. A coalition government with a Communist Party, like the CPP-NPA-NDF, is a sure way to destroy the freedom of the target country. The wish of that politician is the most toxic and fatal error this country could make. BE CAREFUL AND BEWARE MY COUNTRYMEN!!! DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHILDREN TO BE ENSLAVED BY ANY FORM OF TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Ouch! This is the one-word reaction of Atty. Darwin Canete, a government prosecutor who likes to spend some of his free time making fun of Dilawan politicians and supporters on social media, to the nasty rebuttal of BBM Spokesman Atty. Vic Rodriguez to Manny Pacquiao's swipe at BBM. Atty. Rodriguez called Sen. Pacquiao's sudden bravery misplaced. Why? Because, in the last 6 years as senator, he was given all the chance in the world to showcase his debating skills against some of the intellectual giants in the Senate but he was too shy to take up all these challenges. In fairness to Pacquiao, he did try his debating skills against Senator Franklin Drilon, which is contrary in my opinion to BBM Spokesman's statement that Pacquiao shied away from debate. But did he perform well against intellectual giant like Senator Drilon? That's beside the point. Anyway, here are some of the comments from netizens, which unfortunately are unfavorable to Senator Pacquiao. One netizen was kind of harsh, calling this as just one of Pacquiao's antics in the hope of catching up with the survey leader. But his antics is clear indication he is unfit for any task that calls for the use of his brain power. Why the sudden bursts of bravado? Naghahabol ng boto por que he slowly concedes na he's not going to make it. Clearly his antics show he's not fit for any task that calls for the use of intellect. I just can't imagine how he'd fare in a presidential debate with impromptu questions. Let's see how he'd deflect contraries on all sides the way he did inside the boxing ring where cerebral stunts are not requisite. This netizen looked Pacquiao with an understanding lens. Saying he was just misled by some people that surrounded him who thinks he really is a gifted person who can lead a country which is not the case. He was misled by the people that surround him. Thinking that he was really a gifted person to lead a country. But never realized he was only used as a dummy This one goes for BBM's Spokesman. Hwag niyo na patulan si manny. Eh alam na nga ninyo na wala siyang alam so thats it hehehe. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, Congressman Boying Remulla, brother of Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla, made a controversial statement accusing that the crowd who attended the Leni Robredo rally in General Trias Cavite was not organic. In other words, many were paid. Of course, the Robredo camp denied Cong Boying Remulla's allegation as per tweet by the OVP Spokesman Atty. Barry Gutierrez. However, many Leni Robredo supporters appear to have misplaced their anger by getting back at Governor Jonvic Remulla, the brother of Cong. Remulla who made the allegation against the Robredo camp. This is the point raised by Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu in her latest FB post. Chu said she found the Kakampinks' behavior hilarious. Why? Because they adored Governor Jonvic last year when the Cavite Governor was pro-Leni and his PR, Macoy Dubs another known pro-Leni. But now that the Cavite Governor is endorsing BBM's presidential bid, the Kakampinks are now attacking the Cavite Governor, to the point that they are now threatening to release a video showing how bad he is, including vote-buying issue allegation. Chu reminded the Kakampinks that Jonvic was an anti-Duterte. Now, the Kakampinks are now attacking Jonvic when it was his brother, Cong. Boying who made the noise about Kakampinks getting paid to attend the Leni Robredo rally in Cavite.

Pinoy Trending News,"During the recent inauguration of the Farmer's Market in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, President Duterte made a slight detour from his speech and talked about his dorm mates in college (probably when he was taking up Law in San Beda College) whom he said were mostly Ilocanos and many of them became members of his government when became President like Dulay of the BIR and Bello of DOLE. His roommate was Yasay, a Bisaya from Cotabato whom he also appointed to a government position but was rejected by the CA (Commission of Appointment) because he was an American citizen. Moving forward, President Duterte confessed that in his government, there are only 3 or 4 Bisaya left, majority are Ilocanos. That is why, in a months time, he will give up the position and leave Malacanan so he told the Ilocano audience to choose who among the Ilocano leaders as his successor.

Pinoy Trending News,"This is a DASTARDLY LIE!!! This is the reaction of Political Science Professor Clarita Carlos who immediately took to Facebook to vehemently belie insinuation by ANC that Marcos nor any other presidential candidate for that matter asked for advance debate questions from her. Carlos remarked that nothing stops a network from supporting a particular candidate but she advised them to change their legal personality from being a media entity to a PAC? I google the acronym and WIKIPDIA says PAC is Political Action Committee. PAC is defined by Google as an organization that campaigns for particular political policies, and that gives money to political parties or candidates who support those policies. PAC is an abbreviation for political action committee. Carlos appealed to ANC to act like human beings. In the postscript, Carlos mentioned one candidate which the network noted kept on badgering them for advance questions and when the network refused, the said candidate eventually withdrew at the last minute from the debate. You may now read Prof. Carlos FB post. An FB friend posted in one of my walls, seeking clarification from me, in re some news where I was ostensibly quoted, cum my picture... 1. The newsclip, datelined ANC, quoted me that ""the camp of BBM sought advance questions"", before a debate. This is a DASTARDLY LIE!!! 2. If those interviews would be run, without compromising it, anyone, with even an IQ of 70, would see that there was ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF BBM NOR ANY CANDIDATE, IN MY INTERVIEWS, in regard to requesting for advance questions!!!!! 3. Nothing prevents you from supporting a particular candidate, but please change your legal personality to a PAC!!! 4. Sadly and ironically, you present yourselves as purveyors of unexpurgated news... MAGPAKATAO naman kayo! Utang na loob... Salamat... PS. In the SMNI presidential debates held sometime last month, the network itself noted that one of the candidates kept on insisting to get advance questions, which the panel, where I belong, refuse to give. Failing to get advance questions, this candidate, reportedly, withdrew at the last minute... So, there! ",1

If not, well one of the senatorial applicants who earned the nods of netizens, including social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes is Dr. Minguita Padilla. In a Facebook post, Reyes declared that she like her. Reyes went on to use phrases like First Lady-like vibe and more ""Nanay ng Bayan"" peg based on her first impression to be clear. Though, Reyes admitted she has yet to really know more Dr. Padilla. Reyes urged her FB followers to share more about Dr. Padilla if they know her well. Here are the comments of netizens regarding Dr. Padilla. One netizen commented that Dr. Padilla is an eye doctor. she knows her craft - eye doc, medyo colorful din ang personal life but I don't know if she can be a good politician This is seconded by another netizen. She's a good doctor, eye specialist. President of Eye Bank Foundation, a foundation that helps people that needs corneal transplant. She have done so many charity operations for cataract patients.

Pinoy Trending News,"ICYMI, Presidential aspirant Manny Pacquiao took a jab at the presidential candidate who skipped the CNN Philippines debate, accusing the latter of getting scared of the debate. What happen if the presidential aspirant wins? Pacquiao asked. The boxing legend says the presidential candidate who skipped the winning the presidential election is scary because he might steal again. Pacquiao did not mention any names but you would be stupid not to guess correctly who Pacquiao alluded in his statement. The FB page VOVph took to Facebook to respond to Pacquiao's innuendo against the unnamed presidential candidate whom he said might steal again? VOVph asked Pastor Pacquiao if he has any proof to back up the allegation? VOVph used Pacquiao's logic and quipped about an unnamed candidate who attended the CNN debate, did not give a decent response to the questions blah, blah. VOVph ended the brief FB post by joking that until now, it appears Pacquiao is the ""God is the solution"" type of politician when confronted with national issue. VOVph wrote: Di dumalo sa debate... Baka mag nakaw na naman.. na naman? Pastor Manny may pruweba ka? May isa talaga dumalo walang matinong sagot nakakatakot baka mambabae, maging sugarol at mag drugs na naman. Hanggang God is the solution na lng siguro tayo nito. Netizens reacted by bombarding Pacquiao with negative reactions. This netizen lamented that Pacquiao projects himself as a very religious and yet, he likes to tarnish the reputation of his fellowmen. Maka dyos ka nga Sen. Paquiao pero punong puno ka nmn ng paninira sa kapwa mo. Akala mo ang dami mong.alam. pag wla kna masagot, babangitin mo dyos. Babanggit ka bible verse. Another noted that Pacquiao talks a lot. Ang dami mong dada kahit anong gawin mo hindi ka karapat dapat hambog Comedy ka talaga Manny. You never fail to make me laugh remarked another netizen. This netizen reminded Pacquiao that when he skipped the SMNI debate, he did not hear a word from BBM.

Pinoy Trending News,"Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes say Leni Robredo's reaction to the criticism for removing her shoes after the CNN debate, in her personal opinion, made her even more concerned. But before that, Reyes wants Robredo to comment why, instead of being open to criticism, she always has this dismissive attitude towards constructive criticism? Reyes explained that constructive criticism could mean the public are concerned for Robredo's welfare, concerned that equating 3 hours standing in heels and walking barefoot to courage and leadership is incorrect and she has 3 daughters and yet no one bothered to swap their flat shoes with her. Moving forward, Robredo's reaction to criticism is making Reyes worried even more because it mean 5 things: 1. she did get the point of critics. 2. she has been doing this for years and yet she has not learned from her past experiences about wearing high heels. You may now read MJ Reyes original FB post below. SABI NI MADAM: ""Pinagpiyestahan pala ng trolls yung pagtanggal ko ng sapatos after debate... Hindi naman yun first time. Kahit walang election, ginawa ko na yan. Eto resibo. 2016 po ito (photo below)."" SABI KO NAMAN: MADAM, why do you often dismiss constructive criticisms and diminish your critics by calling them ""trolls""? 1. Hindi ba pwedeng concerned lang kami na baka mapasma ka o di kaya ay makaapak ka ng habang nakapaa? 2. Hindi ba pwedeng concerned lang kami when it was made to appear na ang pagsusuot ng high heels for 3 hours at ang paglalakad ng naka-paa pagkatapos ay ini-equate sa tapang at leadership - when clearly it shows otherwise? (To me and to many others, leadership requires foresight.) 3. Hindi ba pwedeng concerned lang kami na you have 3 daughters na all girls who were with you then- and yet none of them offered to swap their flat shoes with you? Now, I am even more concerned when I read your reaction and saw this photo that you yourself have proudly shared. Why? Because it also means the ff: That you did not get our point. That you have been proudly doing the same thing for years now - and still have not learned from past experiences That you came up with this lousy defense when you could have simply brushed it off (and bring a pair of slippers next time or wear something more comfy.) Worse, that you think wearing high heels and walking with your bare feet thereafter (repeatedly for years!) are something to be proud of. Worst, that someone with that kind of thinking is now running for president. *** CT Leni Robredo for the photo ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Leni Robredo complained on Twitter, which was quickly picked up by News5, that netizens trolled her on social media for removing her shoes after the debate. The VP denied it was a PR stunt because it's election. She said even if it is not election season, she really remove her shoes when her feet hurt. Besides, this happens in a regular basis, not just to her but to all women who are not used to wearing heels for a long time. The VP also denied she received advance debate questions from CNN Philippines. Does this mean the critics thought she did great in the debate? Robredo asked. On that note, Atty. Trixie of the Luminous went on to write a rebuttal versus Robredo's statement that trolls feasted on her photo walking barefoot by telling Robredo that it was her who put the target on her back by posting on social media saying leadership is showing up even it means standing for three hours in high heels. Atty. Trixie said she was among those who called out the VP for creating a drama over her high heels. Being called trolls for doing that is unfair. Atty. Trixie asked if Robredo is affected by it? She said Robredo was hurt because they saw through the BS of the barefoot stunt and the heavy-handed way she presented her imagined leadership? You may continue reading the original FB post of Atty. Trixie of Luminous for context. Tignan nyo po itong si madame. KAYO po ang nag post na nagsasabing leadership is showing up even it means standing for three hours in high heels. You opened that door. Ikaw ang nagpapansin sa paa nyo. PINAGPYESTAHAN? eh kayo po ang naghain. We called you out on the kadramahan over your high heels. And for doing that you are calling us ""trolls""? Affected? Nasaktan kayo kasi we saw through the BS and that heavy handed way you presented your imagined leadership? Furthermore, your attempt at logic FAILS. Just because you had previously taken off your shoes doesn't negate the suspicion that what you did was a stunt. Because -AGAIN-YOU were the one who presented yourself as a leader based on your footwear, a statement that most conveniently found its way to your own chuwariwaps on social media. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, VP aspirant and currently Senate President Tito Sotto reminded the public that if they are wise voter, they will go for someone who has studied and learned the ills of government for many years than vote for someone who promise the moon and stars, then just study how to deliver their promises.

Tito Sen...pinag-aralan mo lang pala ang problema ng gobyerno all this time...Sana ni-resolve mo na rin..Eto naman si Sir (Tito Sen, you just studied the problems of government all this time...

Here are some of the negative reactions of netizens to Sen. Sotto's tweet. A wise voters simply not choosing like you, period one netizen wrote. Another netizen lamented that Tito Sen has been in government for ages but did nothing to fix the country's problems. And still hasn't done things to make it a little better..I mean, someone like you, who's been in the government for longest time. This netizen echoed Sasot's sentiment that Tito Sen has been in politics all these years and said he studied all the ills in government and yet he did nothing to solve the so-called ills in government. From vice mayor to tito Sen and yet the only thing he did was to study the problem and made no solution at all. Only during election time that they have solution for such problems. An irate netizen wished Senator Sotto a happy retirement for just studying and doing nothing of the country's problems. Studied and learned but never resolve the issues...have a happy retirement ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On why debates are important, particularly presidential debates, Senator Manny Pacquiao answered that debates are very important to see the sincerity of the individual running for a position. Pacquiao added that a presidential candidate must show up in this kind of invitations so that the public will know the candidate's true intention and plans to improve the country. In that regard, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy wisely used Senator Manny Pacquiao's words against him. Remember, Pacquiao preached about the importance of Presidential candidates (BBM) accepting and showing up in debates because as Pacquiao said, debates are important to know the sincerity of the presidential aspirant. Please read Pastor Quiboloy's rebuttal below. Netizens joined Pastor Quiboloy in urging the presidential aspirant to show up at the SMNI Presidential Debate 2 if indeed he is sincere in his presidential bid and willing to show to the public his intentions and plans for the betterment of the country. Mr. Pacquiao, the Filipino people are expecting to see you on the last round of SMNI's presidential debate. Kung talagang sinsero k s pagtakbo mo at kung tigang gusto mong ipakita sa taumbayan ang tunay na hangarin at layunin mo na mapaunlad ang bansang pilipinas, un na ho ang huli at pinaka-mahandang pgkakataon nyo. wag po kayong liliban sa debate. Milyon-milyong kababayan po natin ang mkakarinig ng mga plataporma nyo... Hindi po namin kailangan ng Pangulo/Pinunong duwag. This netizen commented that those who skipped the SMNI Presidential Debate 1 are all hypocrites. They are very audacious to lecture other candidate. Napaka ipokrito ng mga hindi sumipot sa nakaraang SMNI debate. Anlakas ng loob mangaral pero di sila tumitingin sa salamin. Another netizen recalled that when Pacquiao and 3 other Presidential aspirants skipped the SMNI Presidential debate, they did not hear a word from the BBM camp. But when BBM skipped debates, they have said a lot against BBM. Nung kayo hindi sumipot sa smni debate wla kayong narinig sa campo ni BBM na kahit anung salita Laban sa inyo pag si bbm ang hindi sumipot sa debate panay ninyo salita laban sa kanya at pna palabas ninyong masamang tao ganyan kayo kdumi sa politika Let us end the article by sharing the coolest rebuttal, IMO, by a netizen against Pacquiao's statement.

Pinoy Trending News,"A Tiktok video showing a group of people wearing pink t-shirts with Leni Robredo 2022 emblem are lining up to get their small sack of rice from the barangay has been making the rounds on Facebook. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta shared the video on her FB page KLC Happy Thoughts and Cellphone Repair with the caption: Uy pumila naman kayo ng maayos. In the video, a male voice was overheard saying, ""Bigayan na, bigayan ng bigas sa mga sumama kay Leni. Sumama lang sila para sa bigas."" The male voice added that the rice was part of the ayuda of the barangay, apparently stocks from the pandemic. The video ended abruptly. So I headed to Tiktok to search for the same video and voila, I found it. Turned out, the video was indeed a few seconds shorter. The cut part revealed that the old man who was asked about it confessed he is actually for BBM but went to attend the rally because of the free rice. If you look closely at the door of the multicab, it can be gleaned that the video was taken somewhere in Muntinlupa. Here are some of the comments from netizens. One netizen remarked that Kakampinks are worse because they like to accuse the other camp but turned out, they are guilty too. Grabe tlaga tlaga Ang kkampinks hilig mambintang eh Gawain nila oh...iboboto nyo pa ba yan si Leni Robredo Another netizen made a joke about the free rice from the Kakampinks. Hindi hakot at organic pla talaga ung support kay len-len...may palibre plng organic rice However, this netizen said that the Robredo camp can easily make an alibi that it was the initiative of the LGU and she has nothing to do with it. Bigas ng gobyerno, ipinamimigay sa kampanya? Hahaha. Para-paraan talaga. Syempre hindi makakasuhan yang si Lutang Ina kasi ang sasabihin lang, tulong yan ng LGU at wala siyang kinalaman. Hindi na siya mananalo. Lamog na ang buwan sa kakasuntok nilang mga dilawan at tangampinks. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"For the nth time, let me reiterate what Leni Robredo said in the CNN Philippines debate when asked about the importance of debates. According to her, debate gives presidential aspirants the opportunity, even in limited time, to have their plans heard. The number one ingredient of leadership, aside from character, is you show up in the most difficult times. If you don't show up in the most difficult times, you are not a leader. Even if it's difficult, your presence is a must. As soon as this Leni Robredo statement reached the ears of Pastor Quiboloy, he wasted no time in sharing his reaction on the matter. As wise as he is, Pastor Quiboloy used Leni's own words and slap it on her face, figuratively speaking, to make Robredo realize that her statement about leadership just boomeranged. Pastor Quiboloy asked Robredo if her definition of leadership is showing up in the most difficult times, why didn't she show up in the SMNI debate? Pastor Quiboloy revealed about the Robredo camp arranging a meeting with SMNI about the debate. You see, you can speak like that but unfortunately your words backfired on you. Here are some of the comments from netizens. She's a good actress and a comedian. Robredo should have joined showbiz and not aspire to become President. Having a weak mind, a weak leader and willing to betray the country to the West is unfit to become President, commented a netizen. Dapat artista na lang pinasok nia wag na sya mag aspire to become a president. Di puede ang mahina ang ulo, weak leader, at yun ipagkakanulo ang Pilipinas sa mga puti. Ano eto Cory part 2? sayang ang 6yrs sau Leni gusto namin umayos ang goberyno at ang bansa na mas lalong umunlad after PRRD. di ka katiwa tiwala sa totoo lang. Magaling ka po magsinungaling promise! So true.. Leni seems to be self righteous and full of hatred.. This is the impression of a netizen of Robredo. She said Robredo should focus on the problems of the country not on the Marcoses and its issues. Focus on the problems of the Philippines po hwag po puro Marcos issues This netizen had a good laugh because what Robredo said backfired on her. Hahaha those thinkers are doers kasi they didnt even think that all words come out in their mouth against to BBM will backfire on them... actually KARMA is real...

Me too I will choose the Dutertes....anyone but not madumb This netizen said the Dutertes don't have the illusion of grandeur.

Pinoy Trending News,"Leni Robredo: Ako bilang Presidente ako mismo mangunguna in every crisis. Please continue reading Robredo's statement below for context. The f@ct checkers like to say that. If you'll ask political blogger Tio Moreno, this is the wrong approach. To suggest Leni Robredo should be a hands-on leader in every disaster or crisis instead of delegating the job to subordinates is both stupidity and ""epal"" said Moreno. The presence of the top government officials, perhaps he meant the President, at ground zero is unnecessary and irrational because it violates both safety and security protocols. Moreno remarked that Robredo's statement below is just one of the long line of classic PR stunts which Robredo relishes. Moreno reckoned that Robredo's reason to personally handle every disaster or crisis, to borrow Lacson's phrase, is ""calamity politics"". That's the very reason why Moreno said that like-minded individuals must do and campaign for the people to reject Robredo in the May 2022 polls. Moreno ended the FB post saying Robredo is not yet ready for the Presidency. You may read Moreno's original FB post below. WRONG! The President, like any other leader, cannot be everywhere at once. To suggest that she should always be hands-on or visible during disaster or crisis rather than delegating the grunt work. The presence of top government officials at Ground Zero is not necessary, as this irrational request violates both safety and security concerns. VP Leni Robredo's statement below is just another in a long line of classic photo ops that she is enjoying. What exactly do she intend to do there? According to Ping Lacson, ""calamity politics""--exactly the reason why we are campaigning for the people not to vote for her. She's not ready for presidency.

Pinoy Trending News,"According to Vice President Leni Robredo, the true essence of leadership is stepping up and showing up even if it means standing in heels for 3 hours. Darryl Yap, the talented movie director and the young man behind the viral series ""The Kape Chronicles"" took to Facebook to reject Vice President Leni Robredo's assertion about true leadership. Yap said a true leader has foresight and a good planner. The photo of Leni Robredo walking barefoot because her feet hurts for standing in heels for 3 hours clearly showed Leni does not have the true attributes of a true leader Yap just described. Yap added that Leni Robredo walking barefoot after the CNN Philippines debate was all for show. And showmanship is not leadership. ► alam ng TRUE LEADER kung gaano tumatagal ang mga debate. alam ng TRUE LEADER na sasakit ang kanyang binti at paa kung magheheels siya. ►POOR PLANNING WRONG DECISION all for a show. Showmanship is not Leadership. ""EH YUNG KANDIDATO NYO NGA DI UMATTEND!!!"" -ng ano? ng SHOW? that's a wise decision. Netizens seem to agree with Darryl Yap's opinion as shown in the comments below. Atty. Trixie of the Luminous recalled Leni Robredo not showing up in SMNI-sponsored debate. Hindi umatend si Leni sa SMNI. So much for showing up in the difficult times. Another netizen used Leni's words to take a swipe at her. Partida sabi nga susuotan daw tayo ng tsinelas, eh siya mismo walang dalang tsinelas. she's talking about herself - because of difficult questions in SMNI - so she did not show up on difficult times, wrote another netizen.

Dapat pla nag heels din sina BBM,ABELLA GONZALES AT KA LEODY sa 4hr SMNI debate para maging true Leader babaw. Meanwhile, Robredo's supporter did their best to defend Robredo. Darryl Yap Let's give it to her. She's 56 y/o & yet endured the 3hrs. Besides, she showed up and delivered! The debate was 3 hours long and yet all you can do was to judge her for wearing heels..

Pinoy Trending News,"Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza was apparently unimpressed with photo of Leni Robredo walking barefoot after the CNN debate based on his latest FB post. Sonza began by stating his conclusion that UP Diliman does not teach ""common sense"" based on Robredo's stunt pulled off after the CNN debate. Sonza reckoned that if you know that the occasion you are attending entails long hours of standing, common sense dictates you either wear a comfortable shoes or remove your high heel shoes during the event. Unless your feet does emit foul smell. Stupidity, Sonza argued, is not allowed. But then you did not use your common sense and pulled a stunt by walking barefoot with your shoes in hand like you are about to cross a river in the mountains. That looks very cheap, Sonza added. Here are some of the entertaining and witty comments from netizens. Nasa heels daw ang true leadership sir jay, joked a netizen. This netizen commented that Robredo pulled the stunt to gain public sympathy. Manong Jay... Paawa effect Lang po Yun.. Bagong pedicure daw po kasi.. Yaan nyo na po..

Ginagawa lahat mapansin lang. paawa effect, patalino effect.. puppet pa din eh, dinidiktahan gusto manirahan sa malacañang eh excited noon pa. This netizen scolded Robredo for lacking the foresight. Mag tsinelas kayo at tatawid tayo sa pilapilan. Mag tsinelas ang gobirno. Bakit naka hi heel ka, alam mong sasabak ka ng ilang oras sa tanungan portion. Dapat pinaghandaan mo yan. Dpat visionary ka. Maayu lang ka s sulti, wala sa gawa. You may now read Sonza's original FB post below. Ang ""Common sense"" ay hindi ito itinuturo sa UP Diliman. Kapag alam mong matagal ang tindigan sa isang okasyon, pulong o event, dapat naka flat shoes ka o kaya maghubad ka ng sapatos na may mataas na takong. Iyan ay kung hindi mabaho at umaalingasaw ang iyong paa. Bawal ang tatanga-tanga! Tapos gigimik ka na bitbit ang sapatos na para kang tatawid sa ilog sa kabukiran. Napaka-cheap ng dating. ",1

This lady netizen said she has come to realized why Robredo's supporters are so focus in attacking BBM because that's their strategy to divert the public's attention away from their candidate's lack of deep understanding of big issues. Now I understand why people campaigning for Leni just focus on badmouthing BBM (di umattend ng debates, convict, anak ng diktador, hindi college graduate) - they need to deflect from their candidate's lack of real deep understanding of big issues. Pang Sangguniang Kabataan ang peg. I say this because I watch all interviews and debates to be able to decide well. I was raised to be anti Marcos but I cannot vote for someone who thinks we should be like Ukraine. This netizen appeared confused why Leni's team keeps changing her campaign color motif. She asked why can't they just copy the good things PRRD/BBM/ISD are doing? Her team keeps changing her colour from yellow, fuchsia, dark pink, red, and now baby pink?!. She's a chameleon in a not so nice way. PRRD once showed his shoe na sira. So fvp removed her heels. PRRD always wear Phil flag pin so gaya na naman siya/sila. Why can't they copy the good things PRRD, BBM/ISD are doing or been doing?Y One commenter is unimpressed and dismissed this is just another PR tweak from her campaign team to sell Robredo as an intelligent and competent Presidentiable to the Pinoy voters.

One netizen wrote that no change of pin can save her Robredo from impending defeat in the polls. There really isn't anything more she/they can do to save her or her campaign.

The Presidential aspirant noted that during the pandemic, she sees the need for the President to lead from the front, not just wait for the reports. She wants to change that and lead by going down to the ground level and know personally what is happening because in times of emergency, we have no time to spare. On that note, political blogger Noel Landero Sarifa can't help but react to Robredo's statement. In a Facebook post, Sarifa asked Robredo what are Cabinet members and LGU for? What happens if six disasters happen simultaneously, will they stand down because Robredo has yet to arrive? Sarifa ended the brief FB post by telling Robredo that if she fails to make the people around her good leaders, ergo, she is a bad leader. Sarifa also mentioned about wasting government funds if Robredo fails to maximize her resources. Anong silbi ng Cabinet members and LGU? So pag sabay sabay ang sakuna, wait lang wag muna kayo kumilos kailangan mauna si Leni? If you can't make people good leaders then you are not a leader, if you cannot maximize your resources it will be a waste of government funds. Netizens who stumbled upon Sarifa's post reacted by making witty comments at Robredo's remark. This netizen said Robredo's VP is lucky to have her as President. Sooner the VP will takeover in the event of an NPA attack. Swerte ng magiging VP nito pag c madam leni ang nanalong presidente hahaha pag nanggulo ang NPA si madam leni ang susugod hahaha sigurado patay agad c VP n ang magiging presidenteOJ Another netizen commented that Leni is very funny because of her statements. Time is not even enough if you are a housewife. Hoe much more if you are the mother of the entire Philippines? Nakakatawa ka sa mga pinagsasabi mo house wife nga lng kulang pa oras, buong pilipinas pa iba ka tlga lumayas kn sa earth ❤❤ Another netizen commented that if that is the case, it's about time we abolished the LGUs. Tanggalin ng lahat ang LGU, ahensya ng gobyerno at lahat ng may kinalaman sa kalamidad at ikaw na Imng ang gumawang lahat...salubungin mo ang nag aalimpuyong bagyo, malakas na electric current ng baha (sabi mong tanga ka), umaasbok na bulkan, at ung mga hindi makitang virus..masyado kang magbuhat ng sariling bangko....kaunting panahon na lmng at mawawala ka na sa gobyerno at matatahimik na sa katangahan mo.

Pinoy Trending News,"When asked why debates are important? Leni Robredo replied that one of the characters of leadership is showing up in the most difficult times. If you (taking swipe at BBM) don't show up in the most difficult times, like debates, you are not a leader. The FB page VOVph wrote this caption on FB when sharing Robredo's quote card from Manila Bulletin: Leadership times 2.. Debate is difficult time. VOVph's FB post elicited laughs from its followers. Of the 1,430 reactors, 1,400 netizens hit the laugh emoji, a strong indicator that Robredo is not taken seriously among netizens. One netizen defined to Leni Robredo the meaning of leadership based on his understanding and personal knowledge. Leadership is the capacity to influence others through inspiration motivated by passion, generated by vision, produced by a conviction, ignited by a purpose. That's leadership. Leni Robredo Another netizen laughed at Robredo's assertion that a debate is already difficult times for a leader. The netizen added that a true debate is when the issue is thrown at them on the spot. That's the time she will defend or make a follow up answer to the previous answer. Difficult times na pala ang tawag sa Debate. Hahaha. Hindi naman debate yan eh, parang assignment lang na ipapasa ang sagot after a week. Ang totoong debate, on the spot na ibabato sayo ang issue...saka mo depensahan o segundahan.. This netizen teased Robredo to try answering the question of Prof. Claros because she will indeed have a difficult time. Try the question of professor Claros s im sure you'll be in difficult time.☺☺☺☺ Another netizen asked Robredo with regards to her non-showing in SMNI debate? The netizen believed the CNN debate is not a debate. Bkt wala ka sa SMNI debate, Leni? Absent ka di ba? CNN debate is not a debate at all. But one netizen was spot on by pointing out that if indeed Robredo believed what she was saying that showing up in difficult times like in debates is one of the characters of a leader, why didn't she show up at the SMNI debate? The netizen said he would have believed Robredo if she showed up at the SMNI debate. So ang debate difficult time for you maniwala pa ako sayo kaya andyan ka pero kung pumonta ka dn sa SMNI baka ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"As war rages on in Ukraine, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza took to Facebook to make an earnest appeal to Filipinos who will troop to our voting centers come May 2022 to learn from the lessons of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and now Ukraine. Sonza wrote that Filipinos must be wise enough not to elect a puppet president who will likely end up as Uncle Sam's lackey. Otherwise, it is not far-fetched our country will suffer the fate of Ukraine. Based on the reactions and comments from netizens, Sonza was spot on and convinced many netizens that electing a non-US lackey in the coming election as the next leader of the country is imperative. I agree Manong Jay...Let's learn from what happened and is happening....Godbless Pilipinas kong mahal... Very true, let not USA be intervening in glocal condition of our Pinas....let us survive on our own and with friendly policies to neighboring states, strengthen ASEAN... Correct guys voice wisely and the next president will not the puppet of USA dhil baka matulad din tyo ng Ukraine isang pindot lang tyo ng China tunaw ang pinas Of course, there is always an exception to the rule. This netizen disagree that the US has abandoned Ukraine. In fact, the netizen argued, the US is sending all sorts of help to Ukraine to help them in their war against Russia. Nagkakamali ka, hindi pinabayaan ng US led NATO ang Ukraine. There remains an outpouring support of money, supplies, armaments to Eukraine from US led NATO. For the past year US have given 1B dollars to support Eukraine's military capabilities.Sanctions are being made against Russia. Ang gyera ay hindi na umiikot sa barilan, malaking bahagi na ang ipitan ng ekonomiya at NATO lang ang makagagawa nun sa Russia. You may read Sonza's brief FB post below. On May 9, 2022, people of the Philippines must be wise enough not to elect a puppet president of the USA. Otherwise, we will be like poor Ukraine, taken for ride, fooled, raped, milked and ultimately abandoned. Matuto na tayo sa mga karanasan ng Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan at ngayon - Ukraine. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"An open letter addressed to VP aspirant Walden Bello is making the rounds on Facebook in reaction to his statement calling Mayor Sara Duterte coward for skipping the VP presidential debate organized by CNN Philippines yesterday. Political blogger Tio Moreno, the netizen behind the FB page AllWrite, wrote an open letter to tell Bello that aside from his name being associated in various issues ranging from the economy, human rights and politics, all of which are anchored on communist ideology, he is basically not taken seriously in Philippine political landscape because Filipinos looked at him more of a nuisance than a politician. BTW, Moreno used the word FOOL instead of nuisance to describe Bello. Moreno went further by pricking Bello's bubbles saying his ad hominem and expletives directed at Sara Duterte can't compensate for his lack of substance. Ouch! Moreno added that if Bello is incapable of a civil discourse, he does not deserve Sara Duterte's time. Like the strict professor in High School, Moreno barked at Bello, telling him to ""Sit down!"" You may now read Tio Moreno's original FB post below. Dear Walden Bello, We completely understand that you are a nobody and that most people don't even know who you are because, aside from the fact that your name is etched in various issues ranging from the economy, environment, human rights, and politics, all of which are based on communist ideology, nobody cares about you because you are more of a fool than a politician. Your ad hominem and expletives can't compensate for your lack of substance. Intimidation using vile attacks to silence opposing views no longer works. It has lost potency. If you're not capable of a civil discourse, then you don't deserve Mayor Inday Sara Duterte's time. Sit down! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Because of Leni Robredo's photo speaking with the aid of teleprompter and making the rounds in the internet, Atty. Glenn Chong argued the Vice President is not fit to become President. Atty. Chong began his argument telling the public that when a person speaks from the heart, words will flow naturally from the mind and mouth. Reading the message from a teleprompter is not very reassuring Robredo is speaking from the heart. Like in the case of Robredo in the photo, Chong's impression the teleprompter is the one campaigning for President and Leni Robredo is just the amplifier. You take out the teleprompter, for sure Robredo will go blank. On a serious note, Atty. Chong said that Leni is better off as the reader of the bible in the church's pulpit than making a mess out of the lives and future of Filipinos by becoming the next leader of the country. Netizens react to Atty. Chong' FB post. This netizen undoubtedly agrees with Atty. Chong. Absolutely Atty Glenn she's unfit to be President aside wala sa puso nya ang mga sinasabi nya. I remember nung dumalaw sya d2 sa KSA alam nya na Muslim Country ganon ang attire nya hanggang knee.Kalurky talaga. Agree to the highest level. Kaya BBM for President and Sara for VP, echoed another netizen. This netizen wished that all have teleprompters when making public speeches to avoid going blank. Sana all may binabasa haha para daw hindi lutang. You may now read Atty. Chong's original FB post. What is in one's heart naturally comes out of the mind and mouth. Balibaligtarin ka man, lalabas at lalabas ang anumang nasa puso mo. Pero kapag binabasa ang mensahe, hindi po ito galing sa puso. Literally and figuratively, it comes from the teleprompter, as in this case. Para bang ang teleprompter ang nangangampanya at si Leni Robredo ay amplifier lamang. Kapag nawala ang teleprompter, siguradong windang at lulutang si Leni Robredo. Seriously, mas bagay kay Leni na maging reader ng banal na kasulatan sa pulpito ng simbahan kaysa mangulo at madamay ang buhay at kinabukasan ng buong sambayanan. MY VERDICT: NOT FIT TO BECOME PRESIDENT SO DO NOT VOTE FOR LENI ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On the need to review the Labor Code and RA 6727 or the Wage rationalization Act, Senator Manny Pacquiao admitted that it would put the private companies, employers at a huge disadvantage. However, Pacquiao believed it is the government who needs to adjust. How? Lower the taxes for private companies and employers to spare them the trouble. Instead of paying for the taxes, they can use their savings to because of the lower taxes to pay for the salary increase of their employees. On that note, VOVph easily shredded Manny Pacquiao's logic in bringing down the taxes to allow the private companies and employers to increase the salaries of their employees. The question from VOVph is: If elected President, Where will Manny get the money to fund for all his lofty promises? Remember he also promised to increase the salary of teachers, nurses? Not to mention his free education. If I may add, Manny also made a promise to build houses for all homeless Filipinos. Does it mean Manny will box everyday? Use his fight purse to fund the government? With that kind of thinking, VOVph said that Manny does not even qualify for Barangay Kagawad. Lower Tax. Increase Salary ng Teachers Nurses etc.. May free education pa.. Saan nya daw kukunin pambabayad sa expenditures ng gobyerno? Mag boxing siya araw2x? Maski brgy kagawad di ka kapasa mane. Here are some of the comments of netizens. What do you expect from Mr. Pacquiao???? That's the limit of his brain Another netizen joked that the Bisaya community is donating Manny to the Tagalogs. On behalf of the Bisaya community, among ihatag si many sa mga Tagalog.❤ wrote one netizen. This netizen lectured Pacquiao that taxes are the lifeblood of government. Without it, it cannot finance basic social services and infrastructures like BBB. The netizen quipped that he thought Manny is a politician but turned out, he is also a carpenter. Like carpenters, Pacquiao likes to make promises and his promises will likely end up literally and figuratively speaking being nailed down... Going nowhere. What can you expect from a person who earn a degree in just darn 3 months. Taxes are the lifeblood of the government. Revenues are used to finance basic social services vital to citizens needs. It also used to fund infrastructures. If you lower the taxes, spending will exceed the funds which will not be sufficient to finance the expenses then budget becomes deficit. Baka kulangin ka sa pambayad ng sweldo ng government employees (like teachers, Basurero..).Akala namin politiko ka lang pero Parang Karpintero ka rin na mahilig mangako at baka yan ay mapapako ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In light of what is happening in Ukraine, Atty. Trixie of the Luminous remarked that by now, Filipinos know which foreign policy makes sense. Atty. Trixie hinted that the candidate whose foreign policy include rules-based approach, forge strong alliances with other nations and rely on Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) is already out of the voters' choices. So by now, we know which candidate's foreign policy makes more sense. Clue: ekis yung rules- based-basta-nasa-tama-at-may- alliances at mag-rely-lang-tayo-sa- Mutual-Defense-Treaty approach. Netizens reacted to Atty. Trixie's FB post by posting witty and funny comments, to the amusement of the silent readers. This netizen joked he is more in favor of the candidate who said that Filipinos are brave, especially the Warays. Dun ako sa nagsabi ng ""malakas ang loob natin. Kaya natin yan. Lalo na yung mga may dugong waray"" Another commented that the candidate who will give the intel report to other president is also out of the consideration. Ekis din yung magbibigay-ng-report-sa-ibang-presidente. What was her foreign policy again? Making Philippines Ukraine-like daw. Hahhahahahhahahaha charrrrrr!!! asked another. This netizen commented that Ukraine crisis has given us who knows foreign policy or not. Sobrang linaw pa sa sikat ng araw kung sino may alam, sa walang alam. 2 And then i just saw an Inquirer post saying that 150 Law Deans and Professors pledge their support to VP Robredo. I wonder if they all subscribe to the same foreign policy? Another noted that BBM is the only candidate who will continue PRRD's foreign policy. So far only BBM will adopt the same Foreign Policy that PRRD adopted. INDEPENDENT PRO PILIPINO FOREIGN POLICY. An enemy to none, and a Friend to many. By the way the situation in Ukraine vindicated PRRD's Foreign Policy. We could have long been under a more worst situation kung pinatos natin ang pressures ni Uncle Sam to go to war with China. And lastly, this netizen expressed his apprehension of Leni Robredo because her foreign policy might be that of the attack dog of the US against China. Nakakatakot if Leni wins and pushed her foreign policy approach to be the attack dog of US against China. We will suffer the same fate like Ukraine. So please lang wag iboto itong clown na to. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"When BBM visited Negros recently, some supporters of Leni Robredo accused the BBM camp of giving free rides to Negrenses to and fro the proclamation rally at BREDCO reclamation area in Bacolod City. In addition, there were also allegation that those who attended the BBM-Sara rally in Negros were paid P200. The FB page Negros for BBM fired back by sharing a video, apparently to show that the saying ""thinkers are doers"" are essentially true. Meanwhile, in Iloilo City. While we were accused in Negros of ""hakot"", Leni Supporters in turn ended up having an attendance check. What an irony. In the video, a male voice can be heard telling his friends to have their attendance check so that they can go home. The OP later did not explain what was the checking of attendance all about but one netizen volunteered an information that gives us the clue who were those required to pass their attendance - contractuals from the LGU. Otherwise, their contracts will not be renewed. The OP shared this screenshot photo and wrote: Kaya naman pala dumami, pati students at hindi reshistro pinapasama kasi may concert daw lol Here are some of the comments from netizens. One netizen wrote that this is the only way to gather crowd. Many are willing because where else can you get free food and even money. No other way to get a crowd.. make a Hakot the people and bayad them with free food..Asan ka nyan ..pakainin pa,mi pera ka pa This netizen quipped that Leni's popularity is more credible if this phenomenon happens also during caravans, not just in meet and greet. The netizen added that having large crowds in grand rally than in caravans makes him suspicious. Mas kapani paniwala tlga qng sa caravan dnudumog hnd lang sa meet and greet. Mas nakaka suspetsa ung madami sa grand rally kesa sa caravan...Parang mas masasabi qng hnd bayaran yung patiently wait sa kalsada kesa pumunta ng grand rally na may banda at madaming artista. Another netizen commented that Robredo's proclamation rally in Iloilo City was well attended because of something else. Nag concert kasi si Ely Buendia nang eraserheads Kaya daw dami dumalo Another BBM supporter slammed the Kakampinks for accusing BBM of having ""hakot"" crowd, but this video she said is worse. Puro bintang na may hakot si BBM ito mas masaklap may attendance pa Meanwhile, this netizen defended the checking attendance saying that as per covid protocol, attendance is a must for tracing purposes. Protocol na para sa contact tracing. Biskan diin ka maadto nga political rally, may attendance gid. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A photo of Leni Robredo with a plate of fried chicken held over hear head, apparently a tribal ritual being performed for the Vice President while in a campaign sortie in Bukidnon has been making the rounds on Facebook. Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes posed a serious question to her FB followers: Sa mga nakakaalam, ano po ba ang tawag sa ritwal na yan? Seryosong tanong. Instead of being treated seriously, 7,700 out of 8,200 netizens reacted to Reyes' query by hitting the laugh emoji on Facebook. Some netizens took the question seriously though and gave truthful answers. IN BUKIDNON IT IS CALLED ""PAMUHAT"" WHICH TRANSLATES TO GIVE BLESSING, PROTECTION, LUCK, AND EVERY GOOD ENERGY YOU NEED. To which another netizen also concurred. Looks like its its a ritual of the Talaandig tribe in Bukidnon. That is a cooked chicken on a plate that everyone present in the ritual are encouraged to partake. It is also done in welcoming visitors, and what's in the picture is probably a part of the ritual where they are asking their God for a blessing to Robredo .And yes, lets show respect to our Indigenous Peoples A netizen who hails from the Cordillera agreed with the comment of the above commenter that the ritual undeniably was performed by the Talaandig tribe because it shares similarities with Ifugao rituals. It looks like a tribal ritual of the Talaandig in Bukidnon. We, Ifugaos, in the Cordillera, have similarities in traditional practices with the Talaandig. This enables Ifugaos in Bukidnon (with greatest concentration in Maagnao) to peacefully coexist with the Talaandig. Intermarriages between the two tribes result to mixed breeds forging a stronger relationship. Meanwhile, some netizens criticized Robredo for politicizing our customary rituals. My opinion, customary rituals regardless of tribe must not be used in any form of politicking.. Politicians are the most individuals disrespect tribal rituals just to satisfy interest..Sad reality, Tribal Leaders volunteer themselves to be exploited by these kind of people.. I respect our tribes and their traditions. But I don't like not even trust that woman. Sa mga tulad kong ayaw na ayaw kay nanay Leni sana sana wag nating idamay yung mga kapatid nating IPs dahil kultura na nila yang ritwal na dapat respetuhin This netizen remarked that no amount of ritual can help Leni Robredo rise in the presidential surveys if she continues to respond to appear ""lutang"" in the interviews. Kahit anong ritwal pa.. pag ang iyong hangarin bilang candidate sa pagka pangulo ay hindi bukal sa inyong kalooban at patuloy kang lutang sa lahat nang interview patuloy paring bababa ang iyong survey rating hangang sa election. This netizen joked that what Leni needs is to perform ritual to the voters, perhaps it will change their minds and vote for her. Dapat yung niriritwal ang mga taong Boboto po sa inyo baka sakaling magbago ang isip..... kahit ilang Ritwal man yan or Blessing or kahit na anu pang paniniwala pag ayaw ng Tao.. Hindi ka talaga Iboboto... Ritual po yan para magbigay ng sustansya sa utak ng isang tao joked another netizen. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the flyers-throwing incident involving some of rowdy supporters of Leni Robredo against BBM and his caravan in Negros, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu remarked that instead of helping Robredo's presidential bid, this rude behavior will backfire in May 2022 because the Filipinos will take their revenge in the ballots. CTTO Chu cited our telenovela culture and love for the underdog as a big factors why Filipinos will vote for BBM because of how the Kakampinks treat him. The recent incident in Negros is one example. Chu urged the Kakampinks to continue what they are doing, including cancelling small businesses that are sympathetic to BBM's presidential bid. Not only that, Chu also want the Kakampinks to continue throwing shades at Filipinos who have no degree because non-degree holders have no right to become the country's leader. Stop him from going near our churches. Call him immoral. Chu believed that if the Kakampinks will continue what they're doing, the Filipinos will take their revenge big time in the ballots. You may now read Chu's original FB post below. Thanks to our telenovela culture, the Filipino has always rooted for the underdog, the kawawa, the inaapi. Kaya tapunan nyo pa si BBM nang kung ano ano. Saktan nyo pa. I boo nyo habang nagsasalita. Pag may caravan, harangan nyo pa tapos sigaw sigawan. I cancel niyo ang mga maliliit na negosyo na gusto lang naman sumuporta sa kandidato nila. Insultuhin nyo ang mga trabahador ng Jollibee, 7-11, atbp. Insultuhin nyo lahat ng walang degree Kasi pag walang degree walang karapatan maging leader. Paalisin niyo pa sa simbahan. Sabihin nyo at tawagin nyong mga immoral In May, 2022, they will take their revenge on you in the ballots. In the meantime, gawa na rin kayo ng group na BASTOS FOR LENI. Yan, dapat yan yung umbrella group ninyo kasi kahit anong profession nyo pwede kayo dyan. ",1

Kaya Tama lang di sya sisipot sa debate Ng ibang network marami din bastos na audience... may transferring spirit KC yun hatred na instill nila sa isip Ng mga tao na nakikinig sa kanila....kawawang bbm he doesn't deserved it. A third netizen lamented that if BBM supporters would do this to Leni, definitely they would call BBM supporters rude. But if BBM was the receiver of such act, the Leni supporters would justify saying BBM deserved it. Kung tayo ang gumawa kay Leni niyan sasabihin nila bastos walang paggalang pero kapag sila deserving daw si marcos ng ganyang act nila.

Hindi si Isko ang pumili sa mga tao na bomoto sa kanya kundi ang taga Maguindanao ang pumili sa kanya, kong may tao kang sisihin Jay Sonza yong mga Mangondadato sila yong tirahin mo at dyan natin makikita kong gaano ka katapang magsalita sa kapwa tao mo. Meanwhile, many agree wit Jay Sonza's opinion. Sir jay pinakikita lng ni Isko, na isa syang political Butterfly, putik yan manggagamit pati si madam sara dinadamay nya sa kagaguhan nya, kawawa na si Mr. Ong, ibebenta lng ang pilipinas nyan, pera2 yan si Mr. Yorme Tolonges... Mali ang nasamahan ni Doc Ong. And that speaks a lot about character and integrity of Isko. But then, Isko isn't really looking to win, he is only after yung kikitain niya sa pagtakbo. How much he earned last time - 50M, 100M? Most likely, mas malaki ngayon. Yun lang naman yun. Kung matino ba nmn yan at may respeto sa ka tandem nya bakit nya kelangn pumunta sa isang lugar na inilaglag ang vp nya dapat sama decline nya ang invitation kung di si doc willy ang gusto nila vp, makasarili ugali mang gagamit ka ka isko sama ugali mo pweee Yan ang klase na magiging presidente. Sa oras ng kagipitan, abandonahin nya tayo kasi hindi sikat at walang pondo ang Pilipinas. Naku baka mangyari nito aasa sa international aid hanggang mababaon na naman ang Pilipinas sa utang na loob sa mga magbibigay ng grants at aid. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Did you see the image below? Well, it has come to the attention of PCADG Region 12 and they are calling the owner of the FB page and a certain actor named Mark Manicad to remove the FB post in question and issue a public apology for the irresponsible use of the PNP uniform, which created a misconception of PNP being a partisan body. On that note, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes grabbed the opportunity to tell netizens that she was right after all that Robredo's visit to the PNP and photo ops with the police force just a week ago was nothing but a PR blitz to make Robredo appear less of a clown and more of a Commander-in-Chief. [PhilStar] If I remember correctly, Reyes even praised Robredo for finally listening to what critics like her have been saying and got rid of her PR team and strategist and hired a new team. [MJ Reyes on Robredo visiting PNP] However, on that same FB post, Reyes reminded the PNP not to forget who humiliated them before the international community by talking about ""palit-ulo"" scheme in the PNP. Moving forward, Reyes said the actor in police uniform pledging support to Robredo is just another example of the Robredo camp trying to pull trick on the public by giving the impression she has the support of the PNP. You may now read MJ Reyes' original FB post below. TOLD YOU Yung pagpunta sa PNP ni Madam sabay labas ng katakot takot na pictorials niya w/ the police force ay isang PR move lang. Their likely objectives: 1. Make her appear less of a clown and more of a Commander in Chief. (Pambawas sa negative impact ng Hadouken at iba pang katatawanang videos). 2. Make it somewhat appear that the PNP is behind her candidacy. After those PNP photo ops last week comes another ACTOR in PNP uniform pledging her support to Leni. PNP has ordered the actor to refrain from using PNP uniform in his endorsement post as PNP remains non partisan. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza offered his unsolicited opinion with regards to the frequent PR makeover of Leni Robredo to make her more palatable to the general public, especially the registered voters, because she has a lot of catching up to do of BBM in the surveys if she hopes to succeed President Duterte as the country's next leader. Here are the comments from netizens. A bad pill will always be bad no matter what color the package is. That's Leni! Does she have time to go back to school to improve her vocabulary? Her language proficiency is too low that she cannot even directly answer questions that begins with ""Why"". Does she have time to go back to law school so she can improve her understanding on the COMELEC law? Look, she even told during an interview that it's ok to accept the money during election as long as you choose the candidate you wanted to vote. That's not what the law says. Does she have time to improve her memory? She cannot even remember the laws that she's citing during one of her interviews! Bahala na kayo kung maniwala pa kayo sa kanya. Re-inventing Leni? No more time, she ran out of time! It's over! No amount of good packaging the bad product will look good. I don't like a person who slander her opponents and raise her own seat at the expense of others. That's so rude.. hearing Leni during the fast talk with Boy Abunda made me cringed.. kilabot to the skin. I'm not voting for her, but I kind of really pity her. I hope she wakes up and gets to feel the real pulse of the nation. She must be surrounded by a cordon sanitaire. She's hopeless... she'll never change no matter what re-packaging you do.. and people's perception too won't change... La na pag-asa yan, hanggang jan na lang yan!! With little over 2 months or exactly 76 days to go before election. Leni's number is way too far to win in this election, sabi nga ni Nora Aunor na ""Walang Himala"" ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"International relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot joined fellow netizens in expressing sympathy for Doc Willie Ong who has been the talk of the town lately after airing pouring his heart out to the public with regards to Yorme Isko dumping him in favor of Sara Duterte as VP while campaigning without him in Mindanao recently. Remember, Doc Willie was considered by many as a shoo-in for a senate slot before Yorme Isko Moreno lured him to run as his VP? And because Yorme Isko's survey ratings is lethargic 2 months or more before the election and very desperate to get a boost for his presidential bid, he is grabbing every endorsement that comes his way from local politicians even if it means being paired with another VP candidate and hurting the feelings of Doc Willie. Netizens jumped into the comment section to share their sentiment on the Isko-Ong drama. If that is true na nilaglag na sya(doc. Willy Ong) ni etneb, then he should withdraw his candidacy as VP and start campaigning for BBM-SARA2022 go doc baka may tsansa ka pang ma-appoint ng next admin. Yes Doc Willie has lots of FB subscribers and watching all his Health concerns ng videos but that doesnt assures him he could get all their votes. He was being used by Isko and he's unaware of it. The best move he could put up to is to join the band wagon of BBM SARA. Doc Willie its not yet late. Do it as early as this It is sad. But that decision to run as VP was decided by both party. Somehow, Doc Ong is partly to blame. Sayang doc willie you should have made it this time as a senator.nakinig ka kasi sa gwaping na yan...sana nag 2nd, 3rd or till 10th opinion ka muna whether your ok to run as vp di ba nga sa mga advice mu sa may sakit if nag aalinlangan kumuha ng opinion matalino si doc for sure, if he was used he consented to it, he would always claim gusto lang makatulong, if that's the ultimate purpose, nagagawa nia na yan as a private citizen kaya nga dumami followers nia, then decided to run again in politics, puede nman sa senator this time a likely win for him, in the end HE CHOOSE the vice presidency...i gather magkasundo sila ni isko sa pagiging ambisyoso na wala sa lugar.. just leave politics and be untainted Trademark na ni yorme yan. From Lim to Erap to PRRD, ang mang-iwan sa ere. I do't know why Doc Ong didn't see this coming. Oh well, siguro malaki din ang acceptance fee niya to run for VP. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"In Tiktok and in other social media platforms, the Kakampinks are heckling the BBM camp for ""fake wound"" to justify wherein he was caught on video avoiding to shake hands with some people in one of the BBM-Sara caravans. In the video below, the Kakampink supporter argued BBM can be seen pulling his right hand away from the bystanders who wanted to shake his hand but looking at the photos published in the local media and posted on BBM's social media accounts, the wound was on the left hand, just above the wrist so the story from the BBM does not add up, so the Kakampink supporters say. Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes, a staunch Duterte supporter but not so much of a Marcos fan, took to Facebook to share her conclusion of the investigation she conducted herself whether the allegation of ""fake wound"" hurled by the Kakampink supporters are true or not. Here's what Reyes found out: When all these handshake issues and that so called edited photo o 'fake wound"" came out yesterday, I tried to check the veracity of the reports from both sides. Like many of you, I wanted to know the truth and know the real BBM. Naghanap talaga ako ng mga FB live kung saan makikita ang kaliwang kamay ni BBM sa video. It turned out, totoo talagang may iniinda syang sugat sa kaliwang braso malapit sa wrist (screenshots below from an FB Live). TO ALL THE SUPPORTERS (of various candidates), kung totoong mahal nyo ang inyong mga kandidato, wag nyo naman kasing hilain ang kanilang kamay lalo na kung sila po ay nasa moving vehicle. Delikado po yun. He or both the supporter and the candidate can suffer shoulder or wrist injury. Hindi ganun kadali ang recuperation lalo na pag nagkaka-edad na. (Take it from me who's been suffering from shoulder injury for half a year now.) Tandaan din natin, tao rin po at hindi robot ang mga kandidato. Nasasaktan din sila. Nasusugatan. Napipilayan. Napapagod. However, Reyes forgot to give a satisfactory answer to the question raised by the Kakampinks that BBM's right hand did not appear to have wound so pulling his right hand away from supporters who wants to shake his hand is unjustified. Was he correct? I took to Tiktok to debunk the allegation BBM has no wound or wounds on his right hand to show that BBM indeed is suffering from cuts, though the cut on the right hand is not as nasty those found on the left hand, hence he was hurt when supporters started to get aggressive just to shake his hand and BBM's instinct when hurt was to pull away his hand.

Pinoy Trending News,"Did you known anti-Marcos but also anti-Leni Robredo Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu has repeatedly said months ago that she will lend her support to the Presidential candidate who has a good chance of stopping Leni Robredo from becoming the next President is now endorsing BBM? ICYMI, Chu previously wrote an article urging the undecided and pro-Duterte to vote for Isko if he/she doesn't like Leni and BBM. What made Chu changed her mind and now asking DDS to choose BBM even if they are anti-Leni but not so much an anti-BBM is inconsequential. You may now read Chu's explanation. To my fellow anti Marcos and anti Leni citizens, as they ask you to support other candidates, please hear me out: I am sure Isko is a good person, but to eliminate Leni the vote cannot be divided. Your vote must be given to the one person who can-once and for all-ensure that Leni and her toxicity will no longer be part of PH politics. So to my fellow Duterte supporters who hate Leni but are undecided because they are anti Marcos, give your vote to BBM. This doesn't mean we will not continue to call out for the Marcoses to return the money, or for history to be revised and say the Marcoses were blameless, or no pillage of coffers or human rights abuses were committed - we will But FEM is dead and BBM is a different breed from his father-Leni however is still surrounded by the same corrupt people who are very much alive who have plunged the PH into being the kind of country who accepted trash from first world nations, who had leaders who allowed the cooking of shabu in our national jails, who allowed the proliferation of NPAs, who have allowed Yolanda victims to suffer for years. Leni right now is already thinking of stopping the BBB projects in Manila and cannot even decide on NPAs and ELCAC with firmness. She is a credit grabber who is easily manipulated, and she will give Duterte's head on a platter to the ICC. BBM isn't brilliant like his father, and that may be a good thing because we don't want a repeat of the Marcos years, but his policies are solid- he will support ELCAC. He understands the value of BBB. He will protect the sovereignty of Duterte's decisions as a leader and won't give him up. He is supported and backed by Sara, the ultimate Duterte, and not just other Duterte groups. We will be the buffer between the loyalists and the haters. We have no love and loyalty for the Marcos name so we will go after him when he steps out of line, but with fairness and no vitriol the way the Yellows will To continue the policies of the Duterte admin, stand solid. Not for BBM whom we do not even like, not even for Sara whom we do, but for the protection of the hard- won policies, groups, that PRRD fought hard for. To give your vote for the one person who can finally and completely eliminate Leni, her party, and her toxic fandom-even when it hurts you, even if it completely goes against your belief, even if it pains you- is our sacrifice for this country that PRRD built.

Pinoy Trending News,"Desperate to get the support of the DDS (Duterte Diehard Supporters), Mayor Isko Moreno's camp is trying very, very hard to sell himself as the choice of the DDS who are neither for BBM nor Leni Robredo by attaching his name to the Duterte brand. Not to mention that Mayor Isko has been telling local media that he is hoping to get PRRD's endorsement for many months now but his prayers has not been answered yet. Whether he is raising the white flag after realizing that PRRD will not ever raise his hand as the anointed presidential candidate, Moreno is now changing tactic and wooing the DDS support. Here's what Moreno exactly said: On top of that, Mayor Isko is also hoping to get PDP-Laban's endorsement, especially from PDP-Laban president Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi. Mayor Isko Moreno is apparently emboldened to anchor the trajectory of his presidential bid with the DDS due to the fact that the people behind President Duterte's election campaign in 2016 are set to announce their pledge of allegiance to Moreno and his presidential bid like the officers and members of the Mayor Rodrigo Roa Duterte National Executive Coordinating Committee led by former Agrarian Reform chief John Castriciones have formally given their manifesto of support to Moreno. [Link here] Will Isko Moreno fool some of the DDS and get their votes instead of voting for other candidates like Lacson and Pacquiao, if they are also not pro Leni and BBM? Mayor Isko can at least give it a try. As they say, there is no harm in trying. But let me address some of the DDS who might be suffering from short-term memory gap, remember how Yorme Isko disrespected and attacked PRRD days before he announced his presidential bid to put himself on the news and so people will start talking his name and get ahead in the race from his rivals? And this? Let me end the post by sharing the ultimate takedown move of Atty. Trixie of the Luminous to Mayor Isko's statement that DDS is now Domagoso Diehard Supporters via her FB post. Hindi nga po nalilipat sa mga gabinete ni Digong ang credibility niya, sa inyo pa kaya? Lalo na at kayo pa ang bumatikos kay PRRD at sa drug war nito. BTW, Isko has changed his stance on the ICC and President Duterte after he was heavily criticized and said he won't hand over PRRD to ICC. [CNN PH] ",1

Netizens reacted by hitting the laugh emoji 8,200 times out of 8,600 reactions in just 8 hours and counting. Here's an excerpt of Robredo's latest pronouncement, apparently to woo the votes from the public transport sector. ""Gusto po natin ang modernisasyon ng ating public transport. Ngunit ayaw naman po natin bigyan ng karagdagang burden ang ating mga pasahero at drivers. Hindi po natin dapat ipilit ang mga polisiyang hilaw at hindi angkop sa konteksto ng pandemya."" ""Ang pangunahing i-focus po natin ngayon ay maibsan ang kahirapan, ma-revive and ekonomiya at ma- control ang pagkalat ng COVID. Ang mga polisiyang hindi angkop at consistent sa objectives na ito ay dapat isang tabi muna.""[Link here] Here are the reactions from netizens below. Since 1986, puro PUT ON HOLD. Lagi nalang mag-pplano. Gaya nga po sabi ni PRRD, people in politics nowadays talk too much, do so little, and act too slow. And PINKLAWANS still want to vote someone who want to put ready-made plans back to the drawing blackboard, table, or even throw them back inside the cabinet, drawer, or flush them in their very own toilets. What a stupid idea. Everywhere in the world transport is a major issue and constantly getting improved and this sorry example of a presidential candidate want to stop it. How the heck did she ever got into office at all I cannot comprehend. Kasi, yung mga concrete achievements ni PRRD ay nasa BBB, so they want to kill them, the same way Cory halted/killed most of FEM's projects and achievements she really wants us back to the era of post 1986 and pre 2016, but we're (the majority) smarter now and will never let that happen again. Wait for the May2022 and you'll see the will of the people.#BBMSARA20222 #UniTeam2022 most probably put on hold as ordered by her bosses the Oligarchs and the Elites, marami po kasing construction firms ang nawalan ng project dahil sa Build Build Build program... and dating PPP kasi eh may mga kickbacks.. highest kickback gets the project. hindi nasusunod ang tamang process of bidding. PPP then was corrupt kaya ginawa ni Duterte ang BBB which resulted to what we have now, thousands of actual visible finished infrastructure projects. When you travel abroad, seldom you will get lost, o kaya mabahala, o kaya ma-stuck sa traffic. Pano ka makakatulong sa ekonomiya if you halt one of the key components for economic development? The Filipinos deserve a good transport system! Mema... She'll replicate what Aquino' did... To stop all good projects that can be attributed to their predecessor...

Pinoy Trending News,"Pro-BBM laywer and election reform advocate Atty. Glenn Chong thumbed down the demand of former Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon for BBM to make his SALN public. Atty. Chong laughed at Guanzon's demand saying she was not only demanding but she talked like she didn't know that as a private citizen in the last 6 years, BBM has no moral, much less legal compulsion to to file his SALN. Atty. Chong suspected that Guanzon's motivation was purely to take a peek at BBM's assets and liabilities or net worth. However, not rain on Guanzon's parade, if ever her demand is granted, whatever evidence against BBM she can get out of taking a look at it is already obsolete since the last time BBM filed his SALN was 6 years ago. Besides, BBM is a private citizen so Atty. Chong wanted to know where BBM can possibly file his SALN? Atty. Chong asked if Guanzon is indeed a lawyer? You may now read Atty. Chong's original FB post below. DEMANDING SI ROWENA GUANZON... Ipakita raw ni BBM ang kanyang SALN now na! Bilang abogado, dapat alam ni Ms. Guanzon na as a private citizen sa nagdaang 6 taon, wala pong moral, much less legal, compulsion na magfile si BBM ng SALN. Besides, saan siya magfile ng SALN as a private individual? Saan nga ba, Ms. Guanzon? Kung gustong masilayan ni Ms. Guanzon ang mga assets, liabilities o net worth ni BBM, the latest available would be yung last filing ni BBM 6 years ago upon ending his term (Exit SALN). But then again, whatever evidence Ms. Guanzon hopes to glimpse from the document would be already stale, obsolete, useless and even irrelevant. This brings us to the question, is she really a lawyer? At any rate, will someone give Ms. Guanzon a fishing rod, hook and bait. She would probably fare better fishing for the real thing in the WPS than for evidence. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"This is awkward! Radio host Mark Lopez called out Manila Bulletin on Facebook for misleading article about American icon Cher purportedly endorsing Leni Robredo's Presidential bid? Lopez confessed he trust and subscribe to Manila Bulletin rather than other MSM outlets but the article about Cher's tweet is something he can just ignore. Lopez asked if the article was the stunt pulled by one their reporters known for being pro-Robredo? Lopez asserted that it was not true Cher did endorse Robredo for president because it was very clear in her series of tweets that she was tweeting about women empowerment. In fact, Cher tweeted she did not know Leni as shown by the attached the screenshot of the former's tweet. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. Hay MANILA BULLETIN can't you vet the news you report or even write about? Really? Desperate moves talaga. parang my influence naman si Cher sa Eleksion ng pinas e di naman yan Pinoy Kaloka❤❤❤ Ginagawa talagang mangmang Mga Pinoy Ganyan Talaga Galawan nio kahit kelan .Sorry 60% of Pinoy choose their Pambato ... KAYA TAMA NA pag manipulate sa mga mahihirap na Tulad namin... Kahit na si Biden pa mag endorse sa ina nila di ko boboto yon di magwawagi ang naninira sa kapwa puro sila bintang na ang mga Marcos ay magnanakaw di nila na isip ang totoong nagnakaw ng magandang buhay sa mga Pilipino ang mga naupo sa gobyerno pagkaalis ni FEM dati number 2 tayo in Asia nong sila na nasa pwesto nasa dulo na tayo ng kahirapan naka bawi tayo ng kaunti dahil kay PRRD,ang tanong sino ang totoong magnanakaw?? You may now read Mark Lopez original FB post. Excuse me MANILA BULLETIN... while I still trust and subscribe to you rather than other mainstream media outlets, in this particular case eh misleading yan nilabas nyo. Pakana ba yan ng reporter nyo na avid supporter ni VP? Kasi, hindi naman totoo na inendorse ni American Pop Icon Cher ang kandidata ng Pinklawans. Ayan at malinaw sa series of tweets nya na women empowerment in general ang kanyang mensahe. Sya nga mismo sinabi nya na hindi nya kilala si VP eh. Ginamit nyo pa si Cher eh wala naman yan paki alam sa Pilipinas. Tapos, palakpakan naman ang mga tangang Pinklawan.... Palibhasa puro lutang, just like their candidate. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Remember the statement of Yorme Isko Moreno's Spokesman underestimating SMNI News? ICYMI, Isko's camp questioned SMNI News' reach and influence in the election because according to Isko's camp, they are not a major news outlet in the Philippines, they have low subscribers on social media and Facebook compared to say, ABS-CBN, GMA News, hence they cannot cancel their previous commitment and accept the debate invite from SMNI News. On that note, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy wasted no time expressing his sentiment regarding the statement from Yorme Isko Spokesman. As per SMNI News' quote card, Pastor Quiboloy said the invitation extended to Yorme Isko was done in good faith. But whatever their assessment towards SMNI, saying it publicly, is an insult to them. At this juncture, Pastor Quiboloy took the opportunity to tell Isko that the SMNI Presidential debate did surprisingly well, generating1.7M views on Facebook as of last night at that time he was writing his rebuttal and 1.4M views on YouTube in less than 4 hours. Once again, Pastor Quiboloy said they felt insulted of what Isko's camp has been saying, for underestimating them. It could only mean that when they are dealing with an ordinary person, not popular or s small network, Isko won't go because the one inviting him is not popular? Pastor Quiboloy ended by leaving Isko with something to ponder on: ""It tells a lot of your character, Isko."" Here are the comments from netizens below. Only goes to show what kind of a person he is: An ENTERTAINER. imagine having to join a ""debate"" only from major outlets just for the ratings rather than the true essence of it. LoL Hindi kawalan kay Isko hindi manalo may talent sya pang contrabida sa pelikula sigurado magka award yan. Magaling syang umarte sa salita body language bagay sa facial expression bigay na bigay good actor kapalit ni Eddie Garcia. At the beginning of Isko mayoral he goes around Manila live at night and clean up its surroundings. I admire him for effort and hardships of what he was doing. Now it truly confirms that he's a good ACTOR/ENTERTAINER but NOT as President of the Philippines. I realised that what he does in the past was just a publicity STUNTS. Ang tawag s mga gnun tao mayyabang...nd n dpat ibino boto mga ganyan kandidato kc nd panga nanalo mayabang n at mapag mataas...yan mga salita nla s mga rally nla pawang kasinungalingan Ing yan s bagay sanay n mana iba s ugali isko traydor...#bbmsarah2022 hambog yn isko n yn pastor.puro nka social media bawat kilos niyang, ang patae nlng niya di niya pnapakita s media. ang sikat bias tv lng yn n ngpupunta yn mayabang n yn. 0000 ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"When BBM declined the Jessica Soho Presidential Interview, the camp of Leni Robredo, particularly her Spokesman Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"Mayor Isko Moreno's camp issued a statement clearly belittling SMNI hence turned down the invitation to attend the Presidential debate and hence cannot cancel a previously scheduled appearance because the latter isn't a major outlet like CNN Philippines, ABS-CBN, News5 and GMA News. Isko's camp asked questions like - how many people watch SMNI to begin with? How many subscribe to SMNI? On that note, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes took to Facebook to scold Moreno for belittling SMNI News. Reyes conceded that SMNI News may not be a major outlet like he said but it's them who came up with the most cerebral presidential forum. Said having that prior commitment prevent him from attending the SMNI News presidential debate was already enough since anyways, their absence, all 4 of them were not missed by the viewers. Instead, all 4 of them who skipped the SMNI event missed the opportunity to show to the public how deep their knowledge, judgment and principles. Isko's statement annoyed netizens, calling him arrogant. Ang yabang talaga. Marami kaming nanood last night. Yayabang grrr Mayabang hahaha sana magpakahumble ka muna remember di ikaw ang number 1 sa survey bro*** He show his real character. Is this a kind of character if maging pangulo siya. Kung saan ang malalakas dun ka lng ba? Do not underestimate SMNI umabot ng 1.7 million viewers sa Facebook and 1.4miliion sa YouTube.

Pinoy Trending News,"Self-confessed anti-Marcos Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu took to Facebook the morning after the SMNI News Presidential debate happened last night to ask her FB followers if they agree like her with BBM's stance on several issues raised during the debate. Chu said she agrees with BBM on many issues more than with people who are holier-than-thou whose only edge over BBM is their families aren't tainted by Martial Law. Here are some of the comments of netizens in relation to Chu's question. Some people don't realize the painful process of going from anti-marcos to finally opening our eyes to the other side of the story. It's not something everyone is willing to do. I had to battle with pre conceived notions and a mindset drilled into me since I was small. But in my pursuit of the truth, kailangan mag effort and mag research. I had to do it for my kids. I've seen whats possible thanks to PRRD's governance. Yan ang hindi maintindihan yan ng iba. Akala nila nag papadala lang tayo.Sana wag naman nila insultuhin intelligence natin at in my case, my love for my kids. I want them to have a bright future. Kaya ang stand ko sa mga tao who dare to look down on me for my shifting beliefs about the Marcoses, I DARE them to have the courage to challenge their existing beliefs. Unless you've done extensive research with an open mind, they are in no position to judge. We aren't deciding based on our opinion. We are forming new ideas based on facts we are brave enough to seek out. It's time to consider that the Marcoses may have been victims too, all this time... Im pro bbm due the stories of my erpat. Now as I read information and researches of many people about the truth in our history I became a loyalist. Also, I dont know if it was only me, but I can feel the sincerity of the Marcoses when it comes to loving the country and its people. MEEEEEEE!! PRESENT!!! Growing up I didnt like them dahil limited info and i agree that maybe filtered ung information na tinuturo about them... they took away all possible explanation that explains the reason behind martial law.. pero my parents and grandparents would always say that it was always better back then.. now i understand, thank you po sa mga tulad nio madam.. in this judgmental and discriminating world/country.. i found solace knowing hndi ako nagiisa sa opinyon If the leadership we need is pure angelic untainted by political struggle then let's vote Leni etc but if we Look forward in economic growth and truly with better agenda then Marcos is runaway. Everyday we wake up and think of martial law we will go nowhere. Those who keep on barking in wrongs of others has done nothing but live in their comfort zone. Follow the catholic priest who leads you to go to heaven but can hardly follow their teachings. Meantime we wallow in misery. Because we are looking leaders who are pristine like Cory relying mostly in her we bulong brigade. Leni is disaster part 2or3. She can't even present the laws while in Congress. Nakalimotan ko na.Not interested in peoples welfare. All for the show. Stop all these garbage we had enough in decades. You may read Chu's brief FB post below. Anti Marcos ako but I agree with BBM the most about his stand on many things-NTF ELCAC, China diplomacy, education--more than I do with people who are pure and self righteous and whose only edge over BBM is their families aren't tainted by Martial Law. Anyone else like me? ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A photo of a presidential candidate taken inside the train, either to check the current state of Metro Manila's train system and at the same time send a message to the riding public he knows their plight has been making the rounds today. Rather than earning ""pogi"" points for presidential candidate Manny Pacquiao, it appears the PR stunt had the opposite effect. Andrew Olivar aka Boy Landi shared the photo of the Senator Manny Pacquiao and wrote the caption below: Basta talaga eleksyon andaming mga Politiko na sumasakay sa TRAIN noh? Yung andaming biniling sasakyan tapos magtretrain lang naman pala. It was not stated in Olivar's FB post when was the photo taken. In fairness to the Pinoy boxing icon, this is not first time he took the train. For sure, before he became rich because of boxing, he used to commute around Metro Manila by train. In 2013, Pacquiao was forced to take the MRT to attend a Christian gathering at the Dolphy Theater in the ABS-CBN Compound after torrential rains and flooded streets stalled traffic along EDSA. [Link here] Netizens reacted by criticizing Manny Pacquiao for the stunt.

Pinoy Trending News,"Retired broadcaster Jay Sonza has nothing but nice words for SMNI News, the presenter and panel members of SMNI presidential debate and everyone involved, including of course the 4 gentlemen who accepted the invitation to make the event a very successful one. Sonza did not end the FB post without taking a jab at the 4 other candidates, saying he was relieved because the absent-minded candidate, dumb, pretending to be good and the last one who have superficial understanding in governance managed to spare themselves the public humiliation by skipping the SMNI presidential debate. Here are some of the comments from netizens. True! Lol!I really wondered why Sec. Gonzales, Ptr. Abella and Ka Leody weren't invited with previous debates and interviews for Presidentiables. They are sensible (though, I dis-agree with Ka Leody sometimes), but malalaman mong may alam sila sa mga topic sa pamamahala ng bansa.It was a great and intellectual, highly commendable programmed debate. Nursery yung kay Jessica Soho compared to this. They were condescending towards SMNI. Yet in the end, it set the bar high on how a presidential debate ought to be conducted. No frills, unexpected questions, no ad hominems. Just pure issues and questions on specific programs of government... No motherhood statements and assertions. Kudos too to Prof Clarita Carlos and the rest of the panelists. First ever na may quality ang debate na eto..hindi pang cute o pag showbiz ang debate...infer dun sa tatlo mas may sense pa sila kesa dun sa 4 na nd nagpunta .congrats..smni..high quality debate..

Una sa presenter at panel members ng SMNI presidential debate; sa event organizers, technical and production teams ng network for bringing it live on free television. Kina candidates labor leader Leody De Guzman, former national security adviser Norberto Gonzales, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at former press secretary Ernie Abella. Naging disente, magalang, mataas ang antas ng talakayan, matino at matalino ang mga usapan, lalo sa usaping ng ugnayang panlabas, national defense against foreign invasion, agriculture & fisheries at internal security against terrorism and rebellion.

Pinoy Trending News,"Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes is pro-Duterte and already expressed her choice for President in the 2022 polls but she is generous to compliment even the political rival of her candidate. Just recently, she gave kudos to Leni Robredo for finally listening, even to her critics who have been telling her to drop her PR team and advisers. Reyes was referring to Robredo's recent 'visit' to the PNP lately, calling it a smart PR move. Another smart move made by Robredo which Reyes noted when she visited the PNP HQ was dropping the pink color motif of her outfit from pink to green. Those photos of Robredo in green made her appear less of a clown and more of a leader said Reyes. For example, the Commander-in-Chief. Reyes quipped that finally, someone's giving Robredo some good PR advice. Despite the compliment and all, Reyes isn't likely changing her mind and voting for Robredo. She just ended the FB post by addressing the PNP, reminding them not to forget who proliferated the palit-ulo fake news and made them look like the heartless and brainless thugs in the int'l. community. Here are the comments of netizens below. Yes, I agree. Mukha nga OK n PR Team nila. Not surprised. Mukhang convincing na magaling siyang lider gaya ng nangyari noong 2016 election. Depende tiga sa PR TEAM yan. Daming humanga sa track records niya. Plus ang galing ng mga media partners niya noon para bigyan siya ng good publicity. Kaya kung mangyari uli ngaun for sure daming ma starstruck sa kanya ngaun Except me.Kasi ang tunay na (visionary) lider d lng dapat dahil sa may magaling siyang PR team. Kaya matatalo pa rin sy Magpalit man siya ng kulay everyday, yong pagiging DILAWAN niya ay hindi pa rin maka camouflage!DILAW NA DILAW ang ina nila In the end, let her speak and they'll be back to square one...lahat ng brand malamang gagawin nila, pati Bearbrand aagawin! #LetMemaSpeak PNP, lest you forget, it was the vice president who made you appear like the heartless and ""baddest"" villain in the international community. Beware of her sheathed fangs. You may now read Reyes' original FB post below now. HMMMM. Mukhang nagpalit na ng PR team & political advisers ang InaNila. That recent 'visit' to PNP and photo-ops with the police force was a smart PR move. Her wearing a green skirt instead of her usual pink (which is associated already w/animosity, hadouken, etc.) is another wise move. Those photos somehow made her APPEAR less of a clown and more of a leader. (They're obviously trying to project a serious Commander-in-Chief image.) Finally, someone's giving her some good PR advice. PNP, please be reminded as to who proliferated those palit-ulo fake news and made you look like the heartless and brainless thugs in the int'l. community. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Atty. Ahmed aka AGP of the Luminous is asking the public to give BBM some time before he start talking about his platform, especially in the economy, In fairness, these noisy few are not BBM supporters who are demanding BBM to spit out his plans for the Philippine economy since the survey leader has been talking about his economic plans in past interviews. Moving forward, Atty. AGP believed that BBM have the economy in his platform but it appears to him, this seems to be secondary to his immediate thrust to national unity and identity. This is just logical said Atty. AGP since the economy is going nowhere if you have noisy opposition who just demand state aid (ayuda) because they feel entitled to it. Atty. AGP said he perfectly understand why BBM is cautious about announcing his plans early for fear that the Opposition will resort to their habit of freezing his plans and torpedo it. Atty. AGP asked the public demanding BBM to reveal his economic platform on social media for patience. The Luminous FB followers agree with Atty. AGP's assertion as shown in the comments below. Correct Atty. yung mga anti Marcos yan ang kino comment nila na kesyo daw puro bukambibig Lang ni BBM ang unity sa mga speeches nya.But if they've watched his vlogs and interviews with DZRH,Boy Abunda, Thinking Pinoy, Korina Sanchez and the other journalist basta Vic yung first name. BBM laid out his plans and platforms for the country.I also noticed that some presidential candidates were copying his platforms and even the exact wordings para may masabi Lang silang plataporma eksakto attorney, alangan tumakbo ng walang plano matibay. ano yan parang botohan lang sa classroom na napagtuksuhan lang or gusto mo lang na tumakbo presidente... nagfefeeling kasi kalaban na sila lang ang may talino. Bbm already stated his plans. The rest are just copycats. Esp the one who has no direction & platform bcoz they survive on being reactive, using the plight of the poor for their campaign! yun nga, mahilig mag copy past kabilang parlor walang originality. ayaw sa debate takot at maka copya ng mga style. style bulok talaga. You may now read Atty. AGP's original FB post below. Mr. Marcos does have economics in his platform; although it seems to be subservient to his main thrust to national unity and identity. There is method to it too. Because our economy won't go anywhere if you have a whiny opposition who just demand state aid because they feel entitled to it. I also understand why Marcos is careful about communicating his plans too prematurely. Kay, what is, may magpa-farafreyz na naman sa mga plano nya; tapos tsoktsakin na naman. Alam na.

The stakes are higher. And the top honcho is attending. Dapat take up the challenge. Di ba a fight is what you all wanted, ""Lalaban ako. Matapang ako. ""Why did you all make urong?

Pinoy Trending News,"On Facebook, International relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot opened a thread on her FB page to ask the role of an unnamed person beside Kiko Pangilinan in the photo wherein Leni Robredo was also seen kneeling on the pew in prayer for divine intervention as she needs to close 30-40% gap separating her from BBM for the presidency. Ano yung role nung binilugan ko? PA? Director? Scriptwriter? Producer? The FB followers of Sasot had a field day trying to out do each other and came up with the wittiest and funniest line for their amusement. BTW, Sasot's FB post has generated 6,338 reactions, 6,000 of which were laugh emojis, 697 comments and 262 shares in just 4 hours and counting. Siya ung ring bearer. Director yarn pra d magkamali ang shooting nla Religion teacher po. Para sa first communion nilang dalawa. Siya yung nagpapa pirma sa mga ikinasal at mga Ninong at Ninang sa Marriage Certificate. Ahahaha mga bagong kasal yan! Pink ang motif nila. Ahahaha Wedding organizer sure ako Bestman ata. Nag papa pirma ng marriage contract all around po sya...PA, script writer, asst. director Gaffer and Technical Director aka Taga Kontrol Kung Gaano Karaming Patak ng Holy Water ang Mapupunta sa Dalawang Nakaluhod. Scriptwriter: Ganito ang pag pikit ng mata, tungo ng ulo, pag kuyom ng palad at kailangan nakatikom ang bibig wag lilingon kahit may kislap ng canmEra! Ok! Best Man po sya. Sila ng maid of honor ang nagpapapirma sa kinasalan at mga ninong at ninang Meanwhile, many netizens can't help but lecture the Catholic church about the importance staying neutral in politics. Some were harsh in criticizing the priest for allowing Leni Robredo and company to bring cameras inside the church. Some have minor complaints though against the priest. The Catholic Church must remain neutral when it comes to politics...they shouldn't promote any candidate but instead only promote the teachings of God that is their main purpose... First & foremost, Hindi dapat pinayagan ng pari/priest to have camera or video coverage ang misa nila. If Leni robredo and the priest' heart is pure, they could have requested a 'private' catholic mass or gathering minus the cameras. Kahit strictly family members and campaign team lang nya. Favoritism yung Pare. Dalawa lang pinaluhod nya. Yung iba nakatayo. Tsk tsk. The church is a holy place. It should be solemn inside. Nawala yung holiness ng church. Parang di na nerespeto ang tahanan ng panginoon. Opinion ko lang naman. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"For the nth time, the supporters of BBM's rivals for the presidential 2022 polls are up in arms because BBM's camp announced they are skipping the presidential debate hosted by CNN Philippines. In fairness to BBM, his camp announced he is attending SMNI News Presidential debate scheduled for tomorrow. International relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot went on to ask the Kakampinks that if they believed BBM's absence in presidential debates will make him lose the election, why does BBM needs to attend debates? Sasot's followers were game and jumped in the comment section to share their theories why Kakampinks want BBM to join every debate he is invited. Walang spice at napakasarap na ings. ulam nila...not interesting, no thrill and excitement pag wala si BBM super boring mga buhay nila, walang kasigla sigla...presence pa lang at mga ngiti ni BBM kinikilig na mga tao di pa nagsasalita...Wala tlga silang charisma...PR lang meron sila kuluntoy pa...❤❤❤ Dahil si BBM ay parang isang napakasarap na pulutan, kaya kapag wala sa kanilang panlasa - sila'y parang mga sangganong lasenggero sa kanto na kapag wala ang gusto nilang pulutan, ay nanggalaiti sa galit Gusto nilang makita na mapahiya si BBM dahil alam nila na hindi pumapatol sa bardagulan. Nabigo ang maitim nilang balak kya nagagalit sila. Well ang new issue naman nila ngayon ay sa sobrang dami daw ng umaattend ng campaign rallies ni bbm di na daw natutupad ang health protocols. Pero nung nangyayakap ng matanda at bata yung nanay nila kebs lang sila. 2 hahaha Para insultuhin, laitin at ipahiya sya ng todo - todo. Iyan ang main objective. Parepareho lang naman mga tanong kung platform-based. Ilang beses ba dapat itanong? Wala na ibang rason kundi FAULT FINDING or RIDICULE him. Yun lang naman talaga, wag na magplastikan. You want BBM to attend some circus para sa mga patutsada, name calling and all. Wala naman talagang may gusto sa kanila ng matalino at substantial na discussion. Boring para sa kanila yon. Ang karakas ng kampanya nila is tuligsain ang competitor at i-cancel ang supporters ni BBM.This is the complete opposite of what BBM is and his message. His campaign is rooted sa unity and what he can do for this country. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the Pulse Asia survey wherein BBM garnered 60%, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu took to Facebook to ask fellow anti-Marcos if other presidential aspirants can still catch up unless there's a damning video vs BBM. Unless there's a video of BBM murdering someone, how can Leni, Pacquiao, and Isko even catch up 80 days before the elections? Netizens seem to approve Krizette Chu's observation as shown in the comments below. Nil, Zilch. BBM and his family comport themselves with kindness, grace, and compassion even towards people who call them names. BBM and SDC adhered to their mantra not to succumb to negative campaigning but invest in what they can do. This is the change brought about by the good administration of PRRD. There is a video of BBM killing Pinklawans with kindness and love. May nadaanan silang Pinklawans who were shouting ""magnanakaw"" and he waved at them, blew them kisses and shouted ""I love you"". This man clearly knows how a leader should react. I think my vote is now final They can't beat BBM sawa na kc ang mga tao sa mga self righteous, feeling elite kakampink. Ilang yrs na ring sinisira ng mga ito ang mga Marcos but tahimik lng sila. Now Diyos at masa na ang mag aangat sa kanila. Y❤❤: They won't. Clear as crystal that Marcos is the new president of election 2022.... The force of Marcos and Inday Sara for 6 years will be tsunamic. Economy will back up, trust of government will be maintained and infrastructure will be more awesome. Marcos and Inday Sara's survey are both individually massive because even for simple minded and ordinary citizen like me(and we are millions)- and not even politics fanatical-see the simple yet very clearly, of those 3 things mentioned above in the being of Marcos and Inday Sara... My beloved President Duterte is the savior and Marcos and Inday Sara are the disciples. Huwag daw nga po maniwala sa surveys. Kasi daw sobra Dami supporters sa QC.00 ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Mike Velarde's El-Shaddai has already announced this early that the biggest Catholic group is endorsing the BBM-Sara UniTeam, basically slamming the door to other presidential aspirants who are hoping to get the endorsement of the religious group. However, in the ambush interview with CNN Philippines, Velarde revealed that no other presidential aspirants approached him for the coveted endorsement except BBM and Sara. [Link here] Velarde also revealed to CNN Philippines that he was sold to the idea of BBM's message of unity because it's about time, he said. While BBM-Sara supporters welcome the El-Shaddai endorsement, the supporters of the rival presidential aspirants allegedly reacted by laughing at the endorsement. Thinking Pinoy aka RJ Nieto took to Facebook to confront those who laughed at the endorsement and quipped that these people clearly do not know how to count. TP was apparently saying that El Shaddai endorsement is nothing to scoff at because they have millions of members. Although, they are not as solid as the INC block voting, which is also admitted by Bro. Velarde, still they are force to reckon with in Philippine election. [INQ] Here are some of the comments of netizens below. Even though hindi block voting ang El Shaddai, okay na okay pa rin sana a significant amount of members will vote El Shaddai means God(El) Almighty(Shaddai). It's better to use believers of El Shaddai. And don't make fun of those names guys, really. There are millions of us all over the world. El Shaddai din nagpanalo ke Erap noon... wag nila mamaliitin ang kakayahan makapaghakot ng boto ang mga religious groups. Hindi man block voting ang El Shaddai at least may influence pa din ang endorsement sa decision ng members. This is good than nothing, better than the cringey coming of all religions kuno for Lenlen ng Catholic Church. Juzmio, pinagdamit pa nung kung anu anong ethnic groups kuno at may Muslim pa kunwari - which is a no-no, according to my previous Muslim co-worker. They could not even sing a Christmas song, papasukin mo pa sa simbahan? - Wala ng hihigit na endorsement pa, kundi yung galing sa boss ni TP na si Son of God. Mas mahihigitan pa yung mga pari at pastor na nag indorso ng candidate.Boss ni TP lang ang sakalam. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Photos of Leni Robredo and Kiko Pangilinan praying on their knees with photojournalists, supporters and mediamen looking from the background has been drawing jeers from netizens. Radio host Mark Lopez shared the photos on his wall and wrote a caption encouraging netizens to share their thoughts/opinion of the photos. I will leave it up to you people to draw your own conclusion... Lopez's followers obliged and fired away, each one is trying their best to outdo the other by coming up with the wittiest line to mock or to throw shade at Leni-Kiko tandem. Bad script... Santa-santita the Sequel produced by MSM. If one checks the definition of hypocrisy and wants a visual guide, that one is a prime example. If u will go to church n pray, why need a media? Just asking! Just like what Jesus said about the people we should avoid Photo op, Malaking panlilinlang uli sa mga Pilipino! Di dapt pagtiwalaan, pati simbahan ginamit, pati simbahan nagpagamit. WAG TAYONG PALINLANG SA MGA NAGMAMALINIS If this is what politics is about in the Philippines, woe to all of you, who are hoping for change, progress and improvements.... this is hypocrisy at its best and most laughable!!! 20444 If you do something regularly, it becomes a part of you at di mo kailangan o maisip man lang na ibalandra sa media. E.g. I eat a lot, and I don't always post my food kasi routine yan. But if I cooked something for the first time- or something special, I share it.Same thing with prayers, which is a private moment between you and God, kung routine yan, iyo lang di mo na kailangan i-share. Pero kung first time mo gawin. o gusto mo palabasin na magaling ka, mag-iimbita ka pa ng professional photographers para picturan ka. (Not sure how people can pray with that much flash on their faces though. Are you thinking ""God, I want to communicate with You"" or ""Geez, I hope my foundation matches my neck"") Never trust a politician who teaches you how to pray. Never trust a priest telling you how to vote. Prayers must always be between you and God! Not between you and the camera! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"A photo of BBM shared with Dr. Vicky Belo and her husband Hayden Kho has inspired retired broadcaster Jay Sonza to tease the group known for calling to cancel out celebrities and popular people that do not subscribe to their political color. These group of people, mostly from Katol network, are twice or even thrice determined if their fellow celebs support BBM over Robredo. In a Facebook post that has gathered 10,000+ reactions in just 6 hours, Sonza wrote that he wanted to see if the pro-Robredo celebs, especially the singer from Katol Network, will create some noise on social media, calling to cancel out Vicky Belo after her photo below shared with BBM circulates in different social media sites. In fairness to Dr. Belo, she has yet to make a public announcement regarding the presidential candidate she will support in the 2022 presidential polls. Sorry guys! I doubt Dr. Belo will reveal her presidential bet since as a businesswoman, she would rather be friends to all, regardless of their political affiliation. Many netizens doubt the Kakampink celebs will do that to Dr. Vicky Belo based on the comments of netizens below. Di nila icancel sina dok Hayden at Vicky kasi mababalik yong mga tunay nilang hitsura.

Pinoy Trending News,"On innuendos being peddled by Toni Gonzaga's critics that she has been paid P120M for her support for BBM? Fake news says Mike Acebedo Lopez, a relative of BBM from the Romualdez side. An apparently irked Lopez asked what is with people nowadays? Each time other people support someone they don't like, they're automatically paid? Lopez lectured the rumor-mongers that in life, there are layers of reasons that makes people subscribe to the politics of a certain politician, intangibles so they say like principles, values and personal relationship. Like for example, Toni Gonzaga's husband Paul Soriano is Liza Araneta Marcos nephew? BBM is not only wedding 'Ninong' of Toni and Paul's wedding, they have blood connections too. You may now read Mike Acebedo Lopez's original FB post for your enlightenment below. So lies are now being peddled in media chat groups that Toni was supposedly paid Php120M for her support for BBM. Gosh, what is it with these people and money? Each time other people support someone you don't like they're automatically paid? Bayaran kaagad? There are a bunch of other reasons that motivate people when they choose their brand of politics (or politicians), intangibles like principles, values, and personal relationships that make them see things from a different perspective. In Toni's case, did you know that her husband, Paul Del Mar Soriano, is the blood nephew of BBM's wife, Liza Cacho Araneta-Marcos? Paul's dad is Cacho first cousins with Liza; Paul's paternal grandma and Liza's mom are sisters (this makes Paul second cousins with BBM's kids Sandro, Simon, and Vincent)! Furthermore, BBM and his wife stood as principal sponsors during Paul and Toni's wedding. This relationship enables Toni to see BBM not one dimensionally, not limited to how he is perceived or judged by others or how he is often presented by the network where she used to work. Life, people, and issues are very rarely black or white, they are nuanced. There are gradients to our existence. Even when you say that facts are facts, there isn't just one fact of life-life is made up of countless facts that make a ""good versus evil"" narrative rather overly simplistic. And to think these people pride themselves in possessing superior intellect? Is unidimensional, linear thinking (in a multi-dimensional, multifaceted world) a distinctive feature of brilliance? I beg to differ. ",1

Toni Gonzaga wrote UNBOTHERED, apparently to send a message to her critics who are calling their fellow Kakampinks to cancel her out. On Instagram, Erik Matti responded to Toni Gonzaga's 'UNBOTHERED' socmed post, to tell the actress she can support any political candidate whether or not out of affinity, blood or loyalty is between her and her conscience. Matti said Toni can do whatever she want with your celebrity power and God's guidance because this is a free world, after all.

The Robredo supporters spewed so much hate towards the direction of Toni Gonzaga, calling her all sorts of name and worse, starting a trend calling to cancel out the actress/TV host. In light of this, a netizen named Amyson Cudapas, a business owner according to his FB personal account, took to Facebook to write an impassioned appeal to Toni Gonzaga's haters to leave her alone. Besides, just because Toni does not support their candidate means it gives them the right to cancel her. Cudapas added that even they may try to cancel Toni again and again, they can't still pull her down because her family is the reason she stands out. They are just making her more popular, Cudapas added. Cudapas ended the FB post by urging Filipinos to learn to respect each other's political beliefs by expressing it on the ballot without the need to soil the reputation of others. By the way, Cudapas FB post has been received by netizens, who are apparently supporters of the TV host, overwhelmingly.

Just because your political bias is not her bias doesn't mean you are in the position to cancel her. Let people choose who to support and who to vote. You may cancel Toni Gonzaga several times, but you can't still drag her down because what makes her stand out is her family. You are just making her more popular. SHE'S NOT TONI GONZAGA FOR NOTHING! Kaya kung ako sa'yo, wag mo isabuhay ang politika kasi mas madami ang nasisira sa ganyang bagay.

Pinoy Trending News,"On allegation, like the one below from a supporter of Leni Robredo, US-based Bicolano accountant Edwin Jamora debunked the claim, well, speaking from his personal experience. Jamora belied basically three allegations hurled by supporters of the BBM's rivals: 1. individuals who attend the proclamation rally were paid P200 each 2. The crowd were hakot or fetched by buses to and fro the Arena. 3. You pay for the ticket to enter the Phil Arena. Jamora wrote these are lies. He agreed that tickets were issued but it was given free and the purpose was to control the number of people to enter the Arena because of covid protocols. On allegation of 'hakot' by bus, Jamora also debunked this, saying yes it's true they came in by bus because they have to park their car somewhere and then took the bus going to the Arena.

Pinoy Trending News,"Veteran and multi-awarded actress Jacqueline Elizabeth Freeman aka Elizabeth Oropesa vehemently belied the various stories peddled on social media regarding the massive crowd that attended BBM's proclamation rally yesterday. In case you missed it, the supporters of Opposition camp insinuated that the crowd in BBM's proclamation rally was 'hakot' and the photos making the rounds online showing the venue almost filled to the rafters were photoshopped. If I may add, some supporters of BBM's rivals even alleged that those attended were paid P200 each. Not all but many they said. La Oro, as she was popularly known to Filipino movie fans, quipped that if a no ticket, no entry and free- for-all system were introduced by the organizers in BBM's proclamation rally, she said the Phil Arena may burst at the seams with people. La Oro figured the supporters of the Opposition camp made such allegations like 'hakot' and 'photoshopped' because they have been drinking bitter coffee. The FB followers of La Oro also jumped into the comment section to defend the statement of the veteran actress. Perfectly said! Wala kming byad pure loyalista kmi ang sarap nang pkiramdam n naglilingkod kmi n walang kapalit mabuhay BBM Inday Sarah may nanalo n god bless u all. Napakarami pong tao kanina, nakakapangilabot. Marami po ang nagmamahal kay BBM-Sara. Sayang nga po marami ding nasa labas ang walang tiket na di nakapasok. Blockbuster kaya tita Oro kung wala yung ticket sobra pa sa dami ng tao ang pupunta... May winner na kc kaya kinakabahan sila. Gusto ba nila ng proof eh sana pumunta sila sa Phil arena para nakipagsiksikan sila doon. In fairness ang Phil arena ay 50k ang capacity but since May pandemic 50% lang ang pinayagan makapasok at kinakailangan pa ng ticket para makontrol ang crowd. Take note Phil arena yan hindi Araneta stadium, hindi rin Quirino grandstand at lalong hindi rin yan covered court kumpara naman sa mga plaza nila Kaya ba nilang punuin kahit Araneta lang? Bwahahaha!!! Kaya nga po mam! Photoshopped daw. Sila nga po known sa pagnanakaw at edit ng photos eh.. palibhasa gawain po nila kaya binibintang sa iba.. at di nila kasi kaya pumuno ng ganyan kalaking venue⚫ mga bitter! Araw araw mapakla kape at ampalay ulam Nice dok! Loka talaga yan si lenlen pait ng kape LUTANG PA este may nakalutang pa ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"If you are a Dilawan, you are warned. Stop reading right now because Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu is about to say will definitely make your blood pressure skyrocket and that is scary! Chu's FB post made the day of BBM supporters. They are loving every word she said. The number of reactions in her FB post generated in just 5 hours is the proof - 6,300+ reactions, 245 shares and 219 comments in just 4 hours and still counting. Basically, Chu said that BBM's win is inevitable and you Kakampinks don't just get it. BBM's win isn't just a Marcos win but similar to what Duterte did in 2016 - he shoved the middle finger to the faces of LP, the Oligarchs. But not only that, BBM's win is sticking a middle finger to the faces of the judgmental, self- righteous and matapobre Kakampinks. You may now read Krizette Chu's original FB post below. What Kakampinks don't realize is that the win of BBM isn't just the win of Marcos-but a chance to rub their defeat on the faces of the judgmental, self righteous, matapobre Kakampinks. This was only politics until the Kakampinks made it personal by calling anyone who won't vote for their Lutang Ina as bobo. They didn't learn during the Mar Roxas years, they still don't get it. Duterte's run was a middle finger to the LP as a party and to the oligarchs, but this election is a middle finger to all Kakampinks, Yellows turned Pinks, even if they're just fellow Filipinos, even if they're just civilians. This is the most personal campaign season ever... Here's what netizens think of BBM victory. BBM's win will signify another 6 years (and with Sara) possibly up to 12 years of being bitter. Important sa kanila tong laban na to, just imagine having all these hate in your heart for 18 years! Without a doubt, I am raising my Middle finger to the Liberal, Pink man yan or Yellow Agree...di lang political to... personalan na yung iba..mga self righteous hypocrites kasi yang kabilang kubol..puro kasi bitter na kape pinapainom ni Lenlen eh...kala mo katatalino at mga disente eh dami namang lutang at lugaw... Hindi lahat pero nagkalat din Yung iba na inaaraw araw ata pagiging lutang, tanga at b**o. Tsk tsk 222 ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"After listening to BBM delivered his speech at the proclamation rally held today at the Philippine Arena, International relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot of the FB page For the Motherland can't help but quip: Let us read the comments below if netizens agree with Sass's observation. True, I can picture out in him his late father while talking and his charisma is overflowing When you close your eyes, it's like apo ferdinand marcos sr. is talking.. PFEM had both brains and charisma. Actually, I don't understand the dictator notion as he was very popular and I had never heard any complaints about him. And I worked and moved around political circles. Up to this time, what remains in my memory of him is that he was very well loved. FLIRM was not only charming. She was an action woman, readily addressing areas of concern like housing, building cultural centers and hospitals and ensuring the cleanliness of the streets of Manila. Pansin ko sa kanya yung hugis ng lips niya nakuha niya kay Imelda Nung nagsasalita siya kanina, minsan naririnig ko na katunog/kaboses niya si FEM at minsan may tono siya o lumanay ng boses na galing kay Imelda. Galingg.. Indeed! Kung naabutan ng mga millennials and gen z ang itsura ni BBM noon, ay ewan ko lang kung papansinin nila ang kpop idols hehe..poging na poging lakas ng charm Agree, not everyone could be a leader, only few, he is one of the few... He has the charisma... Goosebumps...the tiger's and eagle's strength and desire to serve this country are evidently a balsam to our identity as a Filipino. pero nong pinakita sa camera ung fam nya mga anak halos magiba ang arena sa sigawan So true, Ms. Sass ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"While Leni, Pacquiao, Isko and Lacson preferred to kick off their proclamation rallies in their bailiwicks, banking on their kababayans to turn up and give them morale-boosting crowd, BBM and Sara opted to do it in Bulacan, which Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu found the move very brave. She called this confidence. They are sending message to the public that they can pull crowds in location in the Philippines. Here are comments of netizens below. Lacson in Cavite?

Pacquiao is in Gensan. Isko is in Manila. Lacson is in Cavite. This is what you call home court advantage. They're counting on their hometowns to turn up and give them an impressive crowd. Only Sara from Davao and BBM from ILOCOS Norte are out of their comfort zones, in Bulacan. That's confidence. That's telling people they can pull crowds anywhere in the Philippines. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, a Catholic priest who uses the handle @pads_nosi has created quite a following among anti- Marcos netizens because other than being an anti-BBM, he is also a staunch Robredo supporter. When a fellow priest rant against BBM for skipping the KBP-organized forum, who said it was not only cowardice but a show of arrogance for choosing a cooking show over a forum that aims to help the electorate make an informed choice, @pads-nosi quickly jumped in, telling a BBM supporter, that if this was their attitude, then it just convince him and his kind, BBM will do no good for the country. In addition, the BBM supporter cannot convince them (anti-Marcos) or anyone in their right frame of mind that BBM is doing good for him and much more for the country. @pads_nosi was apparently triggered by a disrespectful reply from someone who identified himself with the BBM-Sara tandem thru his profile pic. Whether he was a legit BBM-Sara supporter, that we don't know since it is easy to pretend as BBM-Sara supporter when in reality, you are a critic of BBM-Sara tandem, correct? Moving forward, US-based Bicolano accountant Edwin Jamora clapped at @pads_nosi, telling him that BBM don't need him since he stands at 70% in the surveys, depending on the survey company who did the survey, if I may add. Pari Koy! We're doing fine. At 70%, we don't need you. Go vote for Leni! Tse! Here are some of the comments of netizens who were apparently taken aback by his language.

He's NOT THE MAN to solve that issue. Yeah right! Secretary of Agriculture of PNoy. That is cute! Pakapalan lang talaga ng mukha,yong ikaw ang agriculture secretary at food security czar 30 years ago,tapos ngayon mo lang narealize after 30 years na marami palang nagugutom.

Pinoy Trending News,"In an attempt to insult/humiliate BBM, a certain Jeck Domilom and fellow Finks shared collage photos of BBM depicting him as a gasoline boy, 711/Alfa Mart/fast food crew and finally an LBC employee. In just two days, Domilom's FB post has gone viral, generating 33,000+ reactions, 22,000 shares and 800+ comments and counting. If you pay attention to the caption, the OP's motive was apparently to make fun of BBM's absence from the KBP-organized forum, saying he was absent because of his busy schedule working in different capacities doing menial jobs as fast food crew and what not. The anti-Marcos forces in Facebook had a good laugh at BBM's collage photo. In fact, out of the 33,000+ reactions, 32,000 netizens hit the 'laugh' emoji. Meanwhile, the BBM supporters, instead of reacting irrationally like having it reported to Facebook, saw it as an opportunity to turn it into what they call ""PR Gold"", to borrow the words of TPL3. Here's how TPL3 explained what she meant by PR Gold. When a black propaganda against BBM backfires...In an attempt to humiliate and degrade BBM with a meme depicting him doing menial jobs, Leni Robredo supporters just LOST VOTES from the C, D, and E strata. Nice. Good job, Oploks! So to ALL and every MATA-POBRE and ELITISTA Marcos haters out there, Thank you!Thank you so much for being sloppy PR idiots! Another BBM loyalist, Engr.

Isip-isip mga kakampinks. Masyado ninyong ininsulto ang mga service crew ng Jollibee, Chowking, 7 Eleven, Shell etc because you wanted to make fun and ridicule BBM with his outfit. ROBREDO'S LOSS IS BBM'S GAIN! In addition, Engr. Benjie Contreras reposted what his brother said about the BBM service crew memes: From: Antonio P. Contreras See what I told you. Now, the BBM camp has owned the meme originally intended to insult him, spun it around, and now shared to his advantage. Mag-isip-isip naman muna kasi. ",1

This is essentially the reaction of social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes to the memes being passed around by anti-Marcos forces on Facebook and Twitter making fun of BBM by showing him wearing different hats from being a fast food crew, an LBC agent, a 711 cashier and finally, a gasoline boy. The memes came out a day after BBM skipped the KBP-organized forum to cook for Korina Sanchez as soon as his one-one-one interview with the TV host wrapped up. Reyes wrote: Mocking BBM by calling him a fast food crew is tantamount to insulting our fast food workers. Tsk! Political blogger Miyako Izabel, a known Robredo supporter, was seething with anger at fellow Kakampinks for failing to see the folly of their action. She argued that making fun at BBM as fast food crew is the same as making fun of the fast food workers. Izabel reminded them that there are cooks and crews out who are still not Kakampink. In other words, instead of helping Leni's cause, they are doing a huge disservice to Robredo's quest for Malacanang. Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu expressed her thoughts on Miyako Izabel's observation. Tama si Miyako. Sya nalang gawin nyong strategist mas may alam pa. Here are the comments of netizens from the FB thread of MJ Quiambao Reyes. Exactly! I don't understand why they use being a service worker as an insult. Personal attack is actually a form of defeat in a debate. They have so much hate. Nakakaawa. Desperate moves for desperate people. That's why their survey rating is going down. There's nothing wrong with fastfood crew but if you are BOBO and TANGA and you are a lawyer and VP that's a disaster. Lalo ng nawalan ng boto from the fastfood crew and gas station employees tsk. How dumb can they get..iniinsulto nila yung nasa laylayan instead na ligawan para sa boto ",1

First off, Atty. Nick told Senator Pacquiao to stop having ambition. Basically, Atty. Nick asked Pacquiao if our courts at present aren't enough because he is thinking of creating a 'people's court' when our court already have enough problems like lack of facilities and judges and personnel? Atty. Nick is incensed is that Pacquiao wants to wrap up the cases in 3 months when the Rules of Court made by the Supreme Court did not say so. Besides, Atty. Nick slammed Pacquiao for his audacity to get involved in legal talks when he knows nothing about the problems of our justice system since he is not of them. You may continue reading Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"In case you missed it, Atty. Trixie Cruz-Angeles of the Luminous interviewed senatorial candidate Rodante Marcoleta on her radio show and asked the latter what he thinks is the solution to the country's high electricity rates, which is second only to Japan. In one of the Presidential interviews, Mayor Isko Moreno was also asked the same question. According to Marcoleta, the best way to lower our high electricity rates is to limit the costs that can be passed on to the consumers. Meanwhile, Mayor Isko Moreno believes lowering the tax is the solution that will make electricity in the country cheaper when asked during the presidential interviews. Based on their answers, Atty. Trixie can't help but exclaim #AlamNaDis in reaction to Isko Moreno's proposal. Of course, Atty. Trixie acknowledged that both want cheaper electricity because that is one of the ways how we can revitalize our economy. However, the similarities ends here. Isko Moreno's proposal favors the Oligarch while Marcoleta's proposal is beneficial to the government and the public in general. Let us read the comments below and see how they react. It only shows kung sino ang mas may alam para sa ikabubuti ng karamihan Si Mayor Isko... Ang solusyon nya para mapababa ang presyo ng kuryente ay pababain ang tax. Baba nga naman ang presyo ng kuryente pero yung mga extra charge na pinapasa sa consumer na syang lalong nagpapabigat sa mga consumer ay mananatili, mga charges kagaya ng system loss, Distribution system, supply system charge, metering system charge, NPC STRANDED DEBT Etc. EtcMababang tax sino mas makikinabang? Mga negosyanting mayayaman narin o mga consumer?... Bawas income narin sa gobyerno...income na magagamit para sa infrastructure development na kailangan ng mga mahihirap na komunidad. Anyway sila mas may alam nyan malay ko ba... Face value kasi ang panglaban ni Isko. Kung ano lang naiintindihan ng masa, while si Marcoleta is yung holistic approach. Iba kasi ang aged wine maysa bagong pinigang obas. Korek! Hahahha... kay isko pro negosyante, hindi marramdaman ng consumer yan. Shunga lang. Grrrrr... You may continue reading below. Si Mayor Isko ang solution para mas mababa presyo ng koryente ay pababain ang tax nito. Si Cong. Dante Marcoleta ang sinusulong na solusyon ay limitahan ang maaaring i-pass on na costs sa mga konsumer. Nakikita dito kung sino ang mas may puso sa taong bayan.

Pinoy Trending News,"On BBM skipping the KBP (Kapisanan ng mga Broadcaster ng Pilipinas) organized debate, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza said he cannot blame him or any candidate for that matter and cited 4 reasons to justify why he agrees with BBM not showing up in the said debate. Of the 4 reasons cited by Sonza, 2 in my opinion stands out. First, Sonza thinks KBP has new questions to raise from the presidential aspirants not covered yet by more than 10 hours of grilling by the top broadcasters of different media personalities in the country. Second, Davila is bad choice of the KBP as presenter because she is known as the attack dog of the Lopezes and a second rate TV hostess. Can't blame some candidates (BBM begs off) for skipping the KBP organized debate on account of the following: 1. What more questions can be asked of them that have not been raised and answered in the more than 10 hours of grilling by the top broadcasters of MBC-DZRH and Manila Times, DWIZ, CNN and Cabangon-Chua Media group of companies and CNN Philippines; SMNI News; Boy Abunda Talk of ABS-CBN and Jessica Soho of GMA7. 2. KBP's choice of presenters is a turn off for many. Karen Davila is known by the industry as a second-rate hostess with a very poor comprehension on any and all subjects. She is also known to be an attack dog of the Lopez business empire and their sponsored presidential bet. 3. Can't say the same of Rico Hizon, other than his expertise is limited to business but his line of questioning is perceived to be bended on the US imperialist interests. 4. BUT, I would love to see the reunion of the Karen-Rico duo. They were a couple of young neophyte once at the old GMA Studio compound, along the 11th Jamboree Street, Diliman, QC. They went separate ways, Hizon walk thru the BBC & MSNBC roads and Davila went up Kapamilya stairs. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"On Twitter, Senator Ping Lacson played the classic Filipino ""bato, bato sa langit, ang tamaan wag magalit"" game by mentioning 5 negative traits of someone... to be followed by asking a politician, probably a rival in the presidential poll, to tell him who are his/her supporters and he will the politician who he/she is. Not for long, a Leni Robredo follower replied to Lacson's tweet saying that when Mocha cussed Leni on live radio, TP and Sasot, Duterte and probed by Duterte's legions for sedition, did Leni budge an inch? No, she said. Hence, Lacson has no reason to get irritated. Lacson burned the fink supporter by asking why the attitude when he did not say it was their group like his ""EPAL"" tweet. Lacson's war of words with the Robredo supporters started when Leni was asked by Boy Abunda why Lacson should not get the votes of the public and she answered that Lacson did not do enough but talks a lot. Something to that effect. Atty. Trixie of the Luminous' took the screenshot of how Lacson burned the the fink supporter and shared it on their page, the Luminous. On their Facebook page, Atty. Trixie wrote: Kahit sa ibang kandidato sunog ang finks. Atty. Trixie's FB followers erupted in laughter as shown by the number of netizens who hit the laugh emoji as soon as they stumbled upon the post. In fact, of the 8,500+ reactions, 6,300 of which were laugh emojis. Here are some of the comments of netizens below.

Pinoy Trending News,"A study conducted by a Tsek.ph found that Leni Robredo is a victim of online disinformation while BBM is allegedly the beneficiary of positive but misleading messaging on social media. [Link here] That is partly true. Critics of Leni Robredo and the Dilawans have been caught repeatedly creating memes of the Vice President allegedly saying this and that and when fact-checked by local fact-checkers like Rappler and Vera Files, the memes attributed to Robredo were indeed fake. On the other hand, BBM is a victim too of fake news from anti-Marcos forces. There are also fake news created by ""alleged"" Marcos supporters whose purpose was to make the image of the Marcoses, particularly BBM, look good in the eyes of the public. However, there are also instances wherein Leni Robredo was partly to blame why negative public perception of the Vice President persists. One example of Leni Robredo's blooper that makes netizen cringe when she confused the vein for a nerve while talking about receiving IV fluids from a medical professional. Head to Tiktok and do a manual search. For sure, you will understand what I was talking about. This is just one of the many examples of Leni's bloopers that her critics on social media want to take advantage of and highlight her bloopers on their FB walls by just talking about it and you can just imagine how many times Robredo's bloopers were shared on different social media sites to the amusement of netizens. Another classic example of Leni Robredo's blooper moments is when she contradicts herself in front of the camera. Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes will elaborate on this in her latest FB post. ""BUILD BACK BETTER"" Gagawin daw ng Mama nila na maging oportunidad ang bagyo.

BBM Sara 2022 Solid South,"BBM'S ROAD MAP TO PRESIDENCY- NOT JUST DESTINY, IT'S A VISION, HE WAS DESIGNED BY HIS FATHER PRES.FERDINAND E. MARCOS By: Richard Solomon What most people never realized about BBM specially his opponents is that he is the most Matured, Seasoned, and most Intellectually-Equipped Politician. They forgot the fact that he was molded by his father who was one of the greatest president of our country if not the greatest of all. BBM was designed by his father to really be a future president (and BBM never knew this of course until maybe lately) but as visionary PFEM was, he tucked and pulled his son Bong Bong always on his side at an early age in his meetings here and abroad, he showed and explained to his son BBM all his projects, make BBM hear and see up close doing his speeches here and there and made BBM seat beside him with Great leaders and presidents of different countries. What do I mean? If there are parents who trained their children to be athletes, tennis players like Agassi and his father , golfers like Tiger Woods and his dad, Neymar the great soccer-player and his father and so on... Bong Bong Marcos too was molded to be a president in the future which is now by his late father the Great President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Nothing is about Luck about BBM,  it's not just destiny but he was actually designed to be a future leader of our country by his dad Apo Lakay Marcos being a visionary as he was. Go figure! Put yourself in his father's shoes. As, a parent, wouldn't you want your son or daughter to do well in life in whatever field they wanted? I believe you would, so does BBM's dad. And God today sealed such great vision that Apo Lakay Marcos made his son to be a future president. Indeed , God is good, he never slept too for 35 years of the Marcoses life after that fake EDSA revolution! CTTO",1

Before the depletion of generation by the Malampaya Oil and Gas Plant, the Government must pursue the joint exploration and exploitation with China.

ThickWallsPH,"ON THE ENTITLEMENT OF OVP TO CONFIDENTIAL FUNDS The OVP under Vice President Sara Duterte’s mandate is under scrutiny because of the agency’s proposal to allocate such approprations for its confidential funds. Now let’s extract the definition of that such compound. DEFINITION As per definition of the Office of the Washington State Auditor, “3.8.9.10 Confidential funds are those funds allocated to the following three types of law enforcement undercover operations: 1. Confidential investigative expenses are for the purchase of services and would include travel or transportation of an undercover officer or an informant. The lease of an apartment, business front, luxury type automobiles, a boat, aircraft or similar effects to establish the appearance of affluence, credibility and a general atmosphere conducive to the undercover role would also be in this category. Meals, beverages, entertainment and similar expenses for undercover purposes, within reasonable limits, would also be included. 2. Confidential funds for the purchase of evidence would include the purchase of evidence and/or contraband such as drugs, firearms, stolen property, etc., required to determine the existence of a crime or to establish the identity of a participant in a crime. 3. Confidential funds for the purchase of specific information from informants.” [1] Additional definition from Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office is that, “Allowable expenses shall include, but are not limited to, the purchase of evidence or information and services such as rental of equipment as required; rental of motel rooms or apartments as required; meals, lodging or other expenses incurred by informants; and other services which may be necessary to further an investigation.” [2] OVP PROGRAM AND ITS EXAMPLE The OVP has three priority programs as listed on its website: Medical Assistance, Burial Assistance and Libreng Sakay. Medical assistance program has an aim to provide services such as giving assistance to a patient that has in need for medication.  Is there any need to disclose the case of the patient that is in need of such service? As per DOH Region 7 on the Doctor-Patient Confidentiality “Full disclosure of information on the part of the patient is a prerequisite to quality care and better health outcomes. Communication between doctor and patient is generally considered privileged and should not be inquired upon even by the Courts. The provision is intended to make sure that information obtained by physicians in the course of treatment will not be used to blacken the reputation of a patient (Rules of Court).” [3] This is when the informant of the OVP will do his/her job. He/she shall protect the patient’s identity while supervising the duration of treatment — from the time of examination, the time of prescription, the time of operation, the time of recuperation (and the time of expiration, if the patient has died from complications) and the time of release. He/she can contact the attending physician. Here, the OVP can offer abode to the patient’s relatives and expenses in that duration. At least an apartment or condominium and daily meals. But, is this all intended to all patients inquiring for as such? No. Here is the intelligence will work. As per OVP’s disclaimer of the medical assistance program:  “Clients confined in suite rooms, private rooms, or private wards by choice are ineligible. If the confinement in such rooms was not by choice, the Client must request their respective Service Provider to issue a certificate stating that the confinement was beyond the Client's control due to any of the following reasons: Emergency cases Non-availability of ward services Cases of communicable disease requiring isolation, including COVID-19 cases. Cases requiring intensive care  Chronic and catastrophic cases requiring prolonged admission“ [4] How will this work? OVP may establish an task force or a mission or job order. Digitalization can do better part of it. OVP AS EX OFFICIO OF NSC In other spectrum, OVP is one of agencies tagged as an ex officio and part of the executive committee of the National Security Council. Is there any need to offer the service to that council? Yes, as Executive Order 34, s. 2001, “ To carry out its functions, the Executive Committee may utilize the facilities and expertise of any of the government agencies and instrumentalities, and promulgate rules and regulations to govern its operations.” [5] VP Sara is known as kingpin to resolve insurgency to her beloved city of Davao, with an excellent supervision of her father, former President Rody. OVP ON FUND NECESSITY Now, is OVP need such funds? Yes, according to the GUIDELINES ON THE ENTITLEMENT, RELEASE, USE, REPORTING AND AUDIT OF CONFIDENTIAL AND/OR INTELLIGENCE FUND, it states that: “ 3.16 Intelligence Practitioners (IP) - refer to the experts or agents duly designated and authorized to perform intelligence information gathering and surveillance activities of the following government agencies:… 3.16.7 Other NGAs which are expressly provided budget allocation for IF under the GAA,or other law/s.” [6] “ 3.18 National Government Agency (NGA)- refers to any department, bureau or office of the national government, or any of its branches and instrumentalities, other than GOCCs and LGUs;” [7] As part of the National Security Council, OVP is qualified to entitlement“ 4.8 CF shall be used only for the following Confidential Expenses: 4.8.1 Purchase of information necessary for the formulation and implementation of program, activities and projects relevant to the national security and peace and order; 4.8.2 Rental of transport vehicle related to confidential activities; 4.8.3 Rentals and the incidental expenses related to the maintenance of safehouses; 4.8.4 Purchase or rental of supplies, materials and equipment for confidential operations that cannot be done through regular procedures without compromising the information gathering activity concerned; 4.8.5 Payment of rewards to informers (non-employee of concerned government agency) subject to the following conditions a. Approval by the HoA in the case of LGUs and NGAs and approval by the Chairman of the Board in case of GOCC. b. Supported with documents evidencing the success of the information gathering and/or surveillance activities on account of the information given by the informer; and c. Directly related to the conduct of the specific confidential activities of authorized agencies. 4.8.6 Uncover/Prevent illegal activities that pose a clear and present danger to agency personnel/property, or other facilities and resources under the agency protection, done in coordination with the appropriate law enforcement agencies; 4.8.7 Others that may be authorized by the GAA or other special Iaw/s.” [8] As OVP has three priority programs, the agency is entitled for it. “ 4.1 The following are entitled to CF and/or IF: 4.1.1 NGAs which are expressly provided budget allocation for CF and/or IF under the GAA or other law/s;” [9] As NGA, OVP is entitled to it. CLAIMS THAT OVP MUST NOT REPORT THE EXPENSES Now, there is a vlogger claiming that after reception of such fund, the OVP is no need to report all the expenses. That is false. According to the same guidelines: “ 5.2 Reporting Requirements 5.2.1 To strengthen accountability, all HaAs of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs which released CF and/or IF shall submit Quarterly Accomplishment Report on the use of CF and IF (Annex C), which must be duly certified by the HoA, not later than the 15th day of the first month of the succeeding quarter, as follows: 5.2.1.1 NGAs - to the President of the Philippines, in the case of IF and to the President of the Philippines, the Senate President, and Speaker of the House of Representatives; and to the Department Secretary in the case of CF;” [10] In which, this is mandatory every month.

The Vice-President has undoubtedly deliverered a scathing one sentence blow against the Makabayan bloc who continue to cower behind the term red-tagging to soften the impact of the exposure and the unmasking efforts by the government and by former CPP-NPA-NDF cadres who have courageously spoken to denounce the atrocities, lies, deception, and the crimes committed by the CPP-NPA-NDF against the Filipino people including the role played by the terrorist allied front organizations. Raoul Manuel is correct on one point though, the Vice-President is indeed a Queen.  Sara Duterte is the kind of Queen that the Filipino people would want to see sitting behind the desk at the Office of the Vice-President. She is fearless. She speaks the truth. She fights for the truth. She despises the lies and the deceptions of the CPP-NPA-NDF. She hates the recruitment of children and the exploitation of our IP youth by the CPP-NPA-NDF. This is the kind of Queen who will inspire the Filipino people to stand united in a common aspiration to put an end to the local communist armed conflict. This is the kind of Queen who will make sure that our students and our youth will no longer be deceived by the CPP-NPA-NDF into joining a lost and hopeless cause.

Pinoy Trending News,"""In difficult moments ay hindi sya nagpapakita."" Leni Robredo's answer to Boy Abunda's question, ""Bakit hindi dapat iboto si Marcos?"" has opened the vice president and even her fellow Dilawans in general to scathing rebuttal from Duterte supporters who also support BBM. Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes can't help but take a swipe at Leni Robredo by debunking that particular statement that ""in difficult moments, BBM disappears"". Reyes shared the photo of an highly emotional BBM attending the welcome ceremony of the SAF 44 at the Villamor Air Base. Reyes quipped that perhaps Robredo was pertaining to PNoy when she said such statement. Or Leni's idea of difficult moment is doing a pre-recorded interview. Reyes said the photo below speaks volume. Some netizens praised BBM for showing genuine emotion to the fallen SAF44. Every time I see this photo, it makes me sad and I can't stop crying. Seeing BBM's facial reaction, it shows how he felt deep inside him, how hurt and devastated he was losing our gallant SAF 44. That is why a lot of pinoys love bbm because of his compassion, dedication and heart full of love and positivity. I still have to see it in leni, but so sad she succumb to her so called ""friend's strategies. this photo says it all...you can clearly see it in BBM's eyes...hurt, sadness, frustration as well as pain...such a tragic event. karamihan sa SAF 44 mga ilocano, nakipaglaban sa mindanao.. kaya masakit sa damdamin ni BBM.. Dahil si BBM ay lahi ng matatapang, may dugong Ilokano at Waray.. He was genuinely crying that time.. Makikita mo kung sino talaga yon totoo tumutulong sa tao na walang ingay ingay o di pinagyayabang na tumulong sya, di gaya ng iba nagiingay maypagkaplastik gusto pinupuri sya.. Some netizens can't help but take a swipe at the Yellows. To the yellows, this solemn occasion was in no way a difficult moment. Their idol was busy inaugurating a car manufacturing plant, a really difficult moment for them. Hindi man lang kinilabutan c Leni ng sbhin nya ang katagang ""in difficult moments hndi dw mahagilap"" wtf Pag wala kasama na media meaning in a difficult moments ay hindi nagpapakita!

Trixie mentioned the Il Figlio study which Amb. Tiglao revealed in his previous FB post that the Leni camp commissioned to give them the idea how the voting public perceives Leni Robredo versus BBM. In the said study, the more they bashed BBM, the higher his ratings go. Despite possessing the Il Figlio study, Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"The shared post of microblogger and political blogger Noel Landero Sarifa about Davao City Vice Mayor Sebastian Baste Duterte officially endorsing BBM as his presidential candidate has been getting positive reactions from solid Duterte supporters who were initially reluctant of BBM. If you've been a follower of Noel Sarifa, he was a staunch supporter of Bong Go's presidential bid and many of his followers shared his sentiment. When Bong Go officially dropped his candidacy, Sarifa shifted his support to BBM. This goes for majority of his followers too who were initially anti-BBM but pro-Duterte. Baste Duterte's official endorsement appears to solidify the support of Sarifa's followers to BBM.

Well, if you asks social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes, she shuddered at the thought of Leni Robredo becoming our next President. Reyes cited 3 reasons why she found Leni Robredo becoming the next President disturbing. Of the 3 she gave, Reyes dreaded the most is the thought that if the people around Leni now can make her do such silly ads and videos, what else can these people make Leni do when she becomes the President? Here are the comments of netizens below in reaction to Reyes' fears Leni becoming the next Philippine President. I just can't imagine what will happen to the Philippines if she wins(may God forbids) I agree po MJ Quiambao Reyes. Just sad as to how and why did they approved such ads. There should always be limitations when doing certain ads especially if someone is running for higher position. #SelfRespect should be the topmost quality that must be presented. Just saying I completely agree with your observation, nkkabahala She gets to be worrisome day after day. Kahit tumabling gagawin nya for the sake of the presidency she longs for. Everything's been terrible for her. Lahat ng gawin niya backfires at her. You're right MJ. To the point na nakaka-awa na to see how desperate they are to resort to the silliest things. Ubos ang dignidad pero parang wala lang sa kanya in her desperate attempt to get people's attention. You may now read Reyes' original FB post below. 3 THINGS NA ""NAKAKABAHALA"": 1. Mother Fuchsia's taste & value judgement. Can you imagine how her admin will promote the Philippines in the int'l community with her kind of ads? 2. Her choice of PR & Advertising. Can you just imagine the kind of people she'll trust and appoint later if she wins? 3. Last and most important: If the people around her now can make her do all these silly ads & videos, can you imagine what else can they actually make her do if and when she becomes the President? Note: I intentionally did not include a screenshot of her latest silly ad here for 2 reasons: 1. Di ko kaya. Nakakaawa kasi kung paano na naman sya pinagmukhang sisa ng mga handlers nya. 2. To also protect my account from getting mass reported and suspended again by some biased platform. I'm sure, nakita nyo na rin naman na. ",1

He also asked the agency or department in government he or she belongs to? Atty. Nick further asked Saab if posting on social social media is not epal but just being transparent? If Saab's answer is in the affirmative, Atty. Nick scoffed at Saab's level of comprehension. Atty. Nick lamented that in Saab's understanding, social media post is part of the documents and reports required for submission. Atty. Nick ended the FB post by leaving us the saying, ""kung anong puno, siyang bunga!"" This is akin to the American saying, ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."" ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Atty. Ahmed of the Luminous shooed away Leni Robredo supporters who visits their FB page after watching the vice president's latest tiktok video making the rounds on social media. Here's how Atty. Ahmed chased away the Robredo supporters like they are afflicted with some kind of a dreaded malady. OMFG... If you still like Leni after watching this... Then I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. I don't even know what to say to you. Just go away. As of this writing, the Luminous FB post has generated 12,000+ reactions, of which 11,000+ hit the laugh emoji, 935 shares and 3,200+ comments in just 4 hours and counting. Netizens who watched the video are without doubt in sync with Atty. Ahmed's line of thinking and perhaps even more savage as shown in their comments below. What a hideous way to portray someone running for president! Leni is pitiful i think for a grown person to just imagine of doing something like this is a sign of desperation. what more of a valid Presidential candidate actually doing it.its looks like a trippy pink ride they all took for this to be produced. Her smile is out of the world, very pretentious!!! It's not a natural smile... The best comedian Oh my, she's so consistent in downgrading herself. Will someone shake her? if they are trying to sell her as double degree in economics and bar passer from UP, they are making a huge disservice to all of us. Look at her here! Does this look like someone who earns such degree? When i was a kid I often see drug abusers from street corners who are taking cough syrup & sniffing rugby when they are high they act this way. Now tell me her party is promoting her being a grad of the best Uni in PH, what kind of impression it is painting to all the Filipino graduates if the grad of such Uni acts this way and happens to be running to the country's top position and is being well received by 20% of population who belongs to the decent and educated sector. If educated and decent sector vouch for her, what kind of people and candidate represents the non decent non elite non highly educated sectors. Yun ang nakakagago masyado sa style nila eh. Ginagago nila lahat ng tao. They are targetting the morals of the Filipinos. She may not win the election but they are winning the battle of discrediting the talents, wisdom, capabilities and mind of tge general public. Look kung gaanu ka bobo ang palitan ng convo sa socmed. Its going nowhere. If they are succeeding in making the majority as stupid as they are our Nation will still plummet down regardless of the winner. That's their game. That's their ploy. ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"Political blogger Noel Landero Sarifa is all praises for BBM because of his message to Filipinos for unity because a united Philippines means progress and prosperity. In the same message, BBM said that no matter how brilliant the government plans, no matter how well researched and well studied, and now matter how many experts we bring in to help the government put together a strategy for the economy, a strategy for our country for the next few years, if we spent all our time, energy and resources in fighting one another because of politics, then all our well-laid plans will not be executed. Sarifa wrote that despite all the hate and mudslinging, BBM chose to be a galvanizing leader. He acknowledged that Filipinos have different opinions and beliefs towards the Marcoses but what BBM is asking from Filipinos, is to unite for the country's sake. Sarifa said that in a country divided by hate and politics, the country needs a leader like BBM to serve as the referee, hold our hands to reconcile the opposing forces for the sake of the country's progress. One country, one spirit, we are all compatriots not enemies. Sarifa ended the brief FB post by making a strong argument that patriotism rather than politics should unite us as one. You may read Sarifa's brief FB post below. Despite all the hate and mudslinging, he chose to be a unifying leader. We may have different opinions and beliefs towards the Marcoses but what BBM is asking us, is to unite for the betterment of our country. Sa panahon ngayon, where hatred and political beliefs divides us. We need a leader na pumagitna at hawakan ang ating mga kamay upang magbati at magkasundo para sa pagsulong ng bansa. lisang bansa, iisang diwa, magkababayan tayo, hindi tayo magkatunggali. Politics will make us hate each other, but then patriotism should unite us as one. Sarifa's emotional pitch for BBM draws positive response from netizens as shown in the comments below. It is just right that BBM had to be proactive, not vengeful, in all of his statements in public especially to those people who are against to his candidacy and the Marcoses, because of all the allegations against their family which were fed to the masses for 3-decade by the yellows. That's why their slogan ""UniTeam or can be translated to ""Unity"" is just right and is in good timing at this present time. Tama yan. Dapat ang maging susunod na pangulo ay UNITY ang iniisip. Dapat talaga magkaisa at maiayos na ang away sa pagitan ng mga Marcoses at Aquinos. Wag nang palakihin pa. Si BBM naman ay handang makipagkasundo na.Kaso lang ang panawagan kasi ng kampo ni Leni ay napakalinaw na DISUNITY at DIVISION, pero ang kanta nila magkaisa raw. Magaling lang sila sa mga salita, drama at theme song, pero ang totoong ginagawa at isinisigaw ay pagkakawatak-watak. Wag na natin silang papayagang maupo, mga ganid at inutil na pinklawan. Dapat lang magkaisa na Tayo dahil kahit kailanHindi maging maunlad Ang ating Bayan kung walang Pagkakaisa! Walang kapanatagan kung walang pagbabago Ang ating mga puso na dahil sa politika naglalayo Ang relasyon Ng magkaibigan magpamilya kahit pa mag asawa!

Pinoy Trending News,"Quizzed by the local media why Vice President Leni Robredo has a lot of catching up to do with the consistent survey leader BBM, her erstwhile rival for the 2022 presidential polls, the Vice President replied: Marami pa actually ang kailangan (para manguna sa survey].

The statements of Leni Robredo and Gilbert Remulla has been turned into a quote card by SMNI News, drawing reactions the followers of SMNI. Here are some of the comments of the critics of Robredo. Alam nyo kasi madumb, pag ang tao kasi sobrang makasarili at uhaw sa kapangyarihan d tlga yan nakakapagplano ng maayos at d tlga yan makakapag isip ng derecho lalong lalo na kung gusto nyong makamit ang isang posisyon sa paraang sisiraan nyo ang kapwa nyo para lng makuha nyo gusto nyo. That will never come out victorious at the end. Gaya lng yan sa trabaho, kung ikaw ay gusto mong mapromote ay meron ka ring katrabho sa opisina na parehas kayo ng posisyong gustong mapromote dapat lumaban ka ng patas, karamihan kasi ngayon para makuha nila yung posisyon ang gingawa nila ay sinisiraan nila ng sinisiraan para lng mapunta sa knila yung posisyon at para sila yung mapopromote, pero kung ako kasi ang boss ng company d papasa sa kin mga empleyadong pa epal, kasi bago ko kasi ipopromote yung isa sa empleyadong gusto ng mataas na posisyon ay syempre marami akong dapat na ichecheck sa kanila, performance level, their sense of loyalty and honesty, their social relatonship with their colleagues specially their real good side in working, and their sense of dedication and comitment. So ang mga Pilipino ngayon d tlga gaya ng mga dating Pilipino noon dhil hindi na tlga mapapauto at mapapaloko ng khit na sinong pulitiko na puro epal Ing.

Netizens jumped in to share their respective opinion, majority of which echoes the sentiment of Gen. Parlade. Yes, General Parlade is correct. The camp of Robredo has no serious programs and agenda for the country and that is what they are trying to offer, a dismal and inefficient candidate. So, people of this nation, time to finally annihilate the dilawans/pinklawans and this kind of candidate. In fact, as it is showing, this woman is confused. BBM Sarah all the way! Tama naman ang tanong ni Parlade, legit talaga ito.Kung tanga ang ipapamuno mo sa AFP, baka magsisi- resign na ang mga ito at lalong dumami ang mga teroristang grupo sa Pinas! Independent nman ang AFP pag c nanay Leni nanalao kaya hindi sya ang magiging commander in chief hahaha pwede po sya sir Parlade. sya po ang tiyahin ni Goku. isang ""hami hami wave"" nya lng po mga terorista at ibpa...

So paano nalang nila tayo lolokohin kapag naging presidente to Totoo naman. It wasn't funny at all for me. Nalulungkot ako sa logic ng mga boboto sa kanya. Napaka selfish nila at hindi man lang nila inisip yung malaking picture kung yan ang iuupp ng mga oligarko sa trono. Ang assumerang may kakayanang mamuno ng bansa, ang ipinagtatanggol ng 3%, ng elitista, ng kanyang mga puppeteers at bayarang supporters.

Pagtawanan na lang tayo kon siya ang maging Presidente kawawa kayo dyan sa Pilipinas! imbis na mas uunlad at tuloy tuloy ang pagbangon ibabagsak nila uli dahil gusto nila sila lang ang may masarap at maginhawang buhay ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"According to COMELEC Spokesman James Jimenez that in the event Bongbong Marcos is disqualified, actions will be taken to remove him from office, that will, in effect invalidate his win. The Vice President, most likely Sara Duterte, will be the constitutionally mandated successor. On that note, Noel Landero Sarifa, Duterte's staunch supporter and political blogger remarked that the statement of the COMELEC Spokesman just made him understand the reason why Sara refused to run for President and slide to VP of BBM. In addition, Sarifa said he felt vindicated because he put forward this theory months ago and of course, raised the eyebrows of some netizens. However, since it is not the Opposition who will succeed Marcos, he does not think they will pursue this angle. Sarifa also answered why BBM is running President and not VP? He theorized BBM learned his lesson and does not want history to repeat in 2022 polls. (However, If I may add, BBM waited for Sara's decision whether to run as President or Vice President. BBM filed at the last minute when Sara was adamant to run for President.) And Sara? If she runs for President and BBM, his VP, lose again like what happened to him in 2016, a repeat of the PRRD-Robredo scenario is not far-fetched. To prevent this from happening, the two decided that a BBM-Sara tandem is the best for the country and ensure the Philippines will move forward to progress and not get bogged down by a troublesome opposition VP. You may now read Noel Sarifa's original FB post below. Now it is clear why Sara run for VP and not for Presidency. If BBM wins and they will disqualify him, Sara is there to replace him, but since hindi pa rin naman opposition ang papalit, I don't think they will pursue the disqualification. After all, tama yong analogy ko before. Why BBM runs for Presidency and not as VP? He lost before and a repeat is more likely to happen if he did. Why Sara didn't run for Presidency, because if she does, VP slate is not secured and knowing what they have done with PRRD, every month may ousting activity nanaman ang opposition. This time around para gumulong ang pagsulong ng bansa, they made sure the President and the VP will be working together, not opposing. ",1

Manila Bulletin,"A measure seeking to penalize individuals scamming riders involved in food, grocery and pharmacy delivery services has been filed in the Senate.   In filing Senate Bill No. 1234, Senator Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito persons who make “fake bookings” or suddenly cancel confirmed orders, refuse to receive unpaid orders and using another person’s personal information when registering for a food, grocery and pharmacy delivery service should be penalized. The bill also seeks to prohibit delivery service providers from requiring advance payments on the part of the delivery rider.   Likewise, under the bill, individuals registering for such delivery service will be required to submit their proof of identity and place of residence. Violators of the proposed law could face up to six months in prison and a fine not exceeding P100,000. In addition to these penalties, Ejercito said delivery service providers requiring monetary advances from their riders could also suffer the revocation of their licenses and permits.   “Our delivery riders are working with a meager pay to support their families in the midst of the dangers of the COVID virus, and making them pay for items that are not theirs is not justifiable and acceptable,” Ejercito said. “In this way, delivery riders will be protected not to shell out their hard earned money to pay for the orders in cases where fake bookings or orders are made,” the senator said. Ejercito hopes his bill becomes a means of safeguarding the country’s delivery riders from the hazards of their daily work. “We must not fail to remember also the contributions of one of our unsung heroes in this pandemic, our delivery riders,” he said. “With the growing demand and impact of online deliveries in our daily lives and our economy, it is but proper for the government to prioritize not only for the economic sustainability of the industry, but most especially the necessary protection that should be accorded to our delivery riders,” Ejercito stressed.

Manila Bulletin,"The House of Representatives Committee on Information and Communications Technology has approved a consolidated bill pertaining to the registration of Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards. The panel approved a consolidated measure consisting of 14 different House bills (HBs) on Monday, Sept. 5. Committee Chairman and Navotas City lone district Rep. Tobias Tiangco presided over the hearing. Of the 14, a total of 10 focused on making SIM card registration mandatory. These are HB Nos. 14, 59, 794, 841, 951, 2113, 2478, 2923, 3299, and 3327. Two of the bills, HB Nos. 116 and 1528 pertain to the regulation of the sale of pre-paid SIM cards. Finally, two of them refer to the eradication of criminal activities that are perpetrated through the use of mobile phones, internet connection, and the use of SIM cards. These HB Nos. 506 and 2819.   Out of all the bills, HB 14 was selected to serve as the lead measure. It was introduced by Speaker Martin Romualdez, Tingog Party-list Rep. Yedda Romualdez and Jude Acidre, and Ilocos Norte 1st district Rep. Sandro Marcos. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman and Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda cited Rule X, Section 48 of the rules of the House of Representatives on the quick consolidation of the 14 measures. “In case of bills or resolutions that are identified as priority measures of the House, which were previously filed in the immediately preceding Congress and have been approved on 3rd reading, the same may be disposed of as matters already reported upon the approval of majority of the Members of the committee present, there being a quorum,” read Section 48. The measure itself was approved on third reading in the 18th Congress and even hurdled the Senate. However, it was vetoed by former President Rodrigo Duterte after he said it warranted further study.  “This humble representation is cognizant of the value of democratizing mobile communication to the public. The increase in connectivity through affordable SIM cards and mobile phones has made government service delivery more efficient and possible in the far flung areas of the country. However, we are also conscious of the fact that the accessibility of SIM cards has encouraged unscrupulous actors to take advantage and use this in the commission of criminal acts,” Acidre said during the panel hearing, referring to the use of SIM cards in facilitating text scams and phishing attacks.   Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel was the sole objector to the approval of the measure. He said that he would file his dissenting opinion in the subsequent committee report.   ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Two months after assuming his post as the Philippine head of state, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. debuted on the international stage when he met on Monday morning his Indonesian counterpart, President Joko Widodo, for a state visit that was expected to strengthen the diplomatic, military, and economic ties of the two countries. The ceremonial rites of Marcos’ visit to Widodo at Istana Bogor or Bogor Palace ran on the dot.  At exactly 10 a.m., the President, wearing a barong, arrived at Widodo’s official residence onboard the Indonesian presidential car, along with his wife, First Lady Liza-Araneta Marcos, who was clad in cream Filipiniana. The couple was warmly received by Widodo and his wife, Iriana, who gave Araneta-Marcos a bouquet of flowers before they introduced the members of the Philippine delegation. The delegates included Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Sec. Enrique Manalo, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Alfredo Pascual, Department of Finance (DOF) Sec. Benjamin Diokno, Marcos Jr.’s son, Senior House Deputy Speaker and Speaker Martin Romualdez. Then, a 21-gun salute started rang out the Philippine and Indonesian national anthems were sang.  A sunny morning greeted Marcos Jr. and Widodo, both still accompanied by their wives, when they finally entered Bogor Palace and proceeded to the veranda, where they had a two-minute small talk. “There is a lot of oxygen here,” Widodo told Marcos Jr. as he showed the landscape of the palace, where the President said he could have “beautiful walks.” Marcos was then led by Widodo for a ceremonial tree-planting activity, that was also done by other head of states who visited the world’s largest archipelagic state. The President planted Pohon Ulin, a special tree in Indonesia. The two presidents, still with their wives, then returned to the veranda to have a more formal talk. The President’s ceremonial state visit ended with an official meeting between the Philippine delegates and Widodo and his officials, who talked about the two countries’ plan of action concerning bilateral relations over the next five years, a defense and security agreement, promotion of culture, among others. In his closing remark, the President said he made a “proper choice” in going to Indonesia for his first state visit as the Philippines and Indonesia agreed to help each other to promote peace and regional development not only in Asia but also worldwide.

She also met with the chiefs and official representatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and officials from the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the DepEd. “As the caretaker, may I reiterate the Marcos administration’s direction towards aggressively pursuing programs and projects that will address social inequities and further propel the country’s progress post-pandemic,” she said in her press message after the meeting.   “Our policy against criminals and terrorists and those that support and espouse their ideologies of violence should be hardline. We should show no mercy to criminals and terrorists,” she added.  Duterte lamented that the “realization of our national aspirations” could be “slowed down, held up, or hostaged” by forces that aim to derail the progress. “The Philippines will only be able to truly recover and rebuild post-pandemic and meaningfully stand with honor and pride as a nation if we successfully address threats to our security,” the Vice President and concurrent Education chief said.   She thanked the “security sector’s professionalism, integrity, commitment, and undying love of our country and the Filipino people.” Duterte met with Lt. Gen. Bartolome Vicente O. Bacarro, AFP chief of staff; Lt. Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., commanding general of the Philippine Army; BFP chief Louie S. Puracan; Jail Director Allan Iral, chief of the BJMP; PCG Commandant Admiral Artemio M. Abu; Major Gen. Arthur M. Cordura, PAF acting commanding general; Rear Admiral Caesar Bernard N. Valencia, vice commander of the Philippine Navy; and Lt. Gen. Jose Chiquito Malayo, deputy chief for administration of the PNP. It can be recalled that the Vice President originally wanted to be secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND) as revealed by Marcos himself early this year during the campaign. The President, however, appointed her to DepEd and Duterte decided to let go of her preference for the defense agency to avoid “intrigues.” Since then, the Vice President and Education chief had made it a point to educate learners and school administrators during her visit to public schools in provinces not to welcome communist ideologies and to shun those trying to recruit them to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. will be leaving Indonesia with several agreements on various areas of cooperation having been sealed just on his first state visit as the Philippine head of state. Upon invitation of President Joko Widodo, Marcos Jr. met him at his official residence, the Bogor Palace, to witness the signing of several agreements and talk about the military cooperation between the two countries. Among these included the crafting of Plan of Action for bilateral relations of the Philippines and Indonesia over the next five years; the renewal of the 1997 Agreement on Cooperative Activities in the Field of Defense and Security (DSCA); and the Memoranda of Understanding on Cultural Cooperation as well as on Promotion on Creative Economy. Also included in their talks is the Philippines’ plan to procure air and sea assets from Indonesia, particularly aircraft and landing platform dock vessels. Delivering a joint statement, Widodo said both countries also agreed to review border security agreements as well as to accelerate negotiations on the delimitation of continental shelf based on UNCLOS 1982. “In the field of defense and security, we encouraged strengthening cooperation and safety and security of waters in border areas,” Widodo said. The Indonesian president also expressed appreciation to the Trilateral Cooperative Arrangement or TCA among Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, “which is very important to secure our waters from threats of hostage-taking and kidnapping.”   For his part, Marcos said he and Widodo, who will lead Indonesia’s chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year, also talked “at length” about the two countries’ role as they “face the difficulties in this very volatile time in geopolitics not only in our region but also in the rest of the world.” “We agreed that ASEAN is going to be the lead agent in the changes that we would like to see in continuing to bring peace to our countries. And again the assistance that we have received from Indonesia [has] been a very important part of that,” Marcos Jr. said as he delivered his part of the joint statement. The President said his discussion with Widodo “progressed so rapidly” that they both agreed to organize task forces already to meet and discuss things even at a technical level. He said these matters are “no longer at the political or the diplomatic level, but at a technical level, so as to be able to take a full advantage of the opportunities that we feel that are available to us, and that we will need to exploit to succeed in the near future.” In his closing speech, the President said he made the “proper choice in coming” here for his first state visit. “I believe that this is only the beginning of many more things to come between Indonesia and the Philippines,” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Philippines and China have had “initial and general discussions” on the possibility of joint oil and gas exploration in the West Philippine Sea but there are “no working level talks” yet, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) bared. These discussions were made during the visits of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and International Department Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (IDCPC) Minister Liu Jianchao in the country in July and August, respectively.   However, the DFA clarified that the discussions did not go beyond initial talks. “The official talks have not gone beyond initial discussions, which were done during the visits of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang and IDCPC Minister Liu. There have been no working level talks,” the DFA said on Monday, Sept. 5. China has expressed hopes that the Marcos administration would consider joint exploration in the West Philippine Sea. Malacañang did not make a stand on this but said they will study the matter.   Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, on the other hand, said that the Philippine government is open to restarting talks with China about joint oil and gas exploration “so long as discussions fall within the limits stipulated in the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines.” In case new talks regarding the matter are pursued, the DFA said it will approach it ” with our national interest in mind.” “We wish to build on the gains that have been reached in principle by our predecessors under a new, mutually-agreeable framework. As in all negotiations with our bilateral partners, the Philippines approaches these matters with our national interest in mind, as embodied in the Philippine Constitution. All our endeavors on this issue will respect international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 2016 Arbitration Award,” the DFA said. It further said that while this matter only comprises one aspect of the two nations’ relations, exploring all avenues of cooperation that would be beneficial to both nations is important. “In general, our relations with China are important and we explore all avenues of cooperation that could be mutually beneficial for both our countries. This matter only comprises one aspect of Philippines-China relations; as such, the Department will continue to coordinate with the concerned national agencies and our Chinese counterparts on developing our relations,” the DFA added. The joint exploration talks were carried out for three years but the country’s objective to develop oil and gas resources have not been achieved despite both sides trying to “go as far as we could,” then DFA Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said. Before ending his term, former president Rodrigo Duterte ordered the termination of oil and gas discussions with China in the West Philippine Sea.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito on Monday criticized the Department of Agriculture (DA), Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA), and Bureau of Customs (BOC) for turning a blind eye on the worsening situation of agricultural smuggling in the country.   In a press conference, Ejercito slammed officials from these agencies saying they failed to fully implement the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act, which he principally authored. “Now that this issue has become really important, it’s really about time that we look into these SRA officials, DA officials, BOC officials, doon sa mga talagang nagkulang. Di nga lang nagkulang, mukhang nagbulag-bulagan (those who were remiss in their duties. Not only remiss, it seems they acted oblivious to it),” Ejercito said.   “Sabi ko nga, mas magastos, mas mahal yung pampabulag. Mukhang tumitingin sila sa kabila. Alam naman natin na nangyayari, di ba (As I said, the methods of blinding is more expensive. They are looking the other way. We already know what happened, right)?” he added. The lawmaker hinted on the possibility of filing charges against negligent agriculture officials in the past six years. “Probably, we can already study the filing of charges against these officials who were remiss in their duties. Kumbaga, pinabayaan nila in the past six years (They were negligent in the past six years),” Ejercito said.   “Hindi naman siguro magkakaganito kalala ang problema ng ating agricultural industry had they done their jobs, kung talagang ginawa nila ang task nila (The problem won’t worsen this way if our agricultural industry had done their jobs, if they did their job),” he added. Ejercito lamented that had the BOC been more active in detecting and apprehending agricultural smugglers, the country’s current woes with its sugar supply would have been avoided. He said the BOC’s recent raids on warehouses containing hoarded sugar prove that the alleged sugar shortage in the country was engineered by agricultural hoarders. “Probably, they are hoarding. Yung mga traders are hoarding these products intentionally para tumaas ang presyo (to increase prices),” he said. Ejercito said he will urge his colleagues to strengthen the Senate’s oversight on the implementation of the country’s agricultural laws. “I’m hoping that our oversight function will be established. It should be revived. Dapat maging active, para mabantayan ang mga batas na ito in line with the President’s direction or directive na dapat magkaroon ng food sufficiency (It must be active so we can guard the law in line with the President’s direction or directive that we should have food sufficiency),” he said. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee is expected to conduct its third hearing on the recent sugar importation mess on Tuesday, September 6.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Senate Committee on Public Services will start an inquiry into the spate of text scams on Thursday, September 8, Sen. Grace Poe said on Monday.   “We will have a hearing to tackle the proliferation of text scams and more importantly to deliberate on the SIM registration Act,” Poe said in a text message to reporters. Poe, who chairs the public services panel, said there is a need to work double time in having a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Registration law to curb text scams that still run rampant and have become more advanced in intruding into personal data.   She said her panel will lead fresh discussions on Wednesday to have a common measure for approval in November. The SIM Card Registration bill, she noted, is one of the priorities of the Senate. this 19th Congress. “Nag-hearing na kami d’yan noon, marami na kaming nakalap na impormasyon at kaisipan tungkol dyan. Kung matatapos natin ang hearing sa Wednesday, technical working group na lang sa susunod na linggo, tapos baka pwede na natin ma-plenaryo (We have already conducted a hearing on this and we have pooled all information and insights regarding the bill. If we can finish the hearing on Wednesday, we can have the technical working group ready next week, then we can go on to plenary),” she said in a radio interview.   “Hopefully, ito ay mapasa by November. Ito ang nakikita nating timeline kasi hihintayin pa rin natin ang bersyon ng House (we can pass this by November. We set this timeline because we have to wait for the version of the House of Representatives),” she added. She also said the panel will tackle the mounting complaints of text scams during the hearing. Sen. Nancy Binay, for her part, said she too will file a resolution urging the Senate to probe the upsurge of text scams, smishing, text spams, and other malicious solicitations and unwanted text messages, saying she too got shocked when she received a random SMS with her name on it. Binay said she was shocked because she never used her personal phone in online transactions. “Grabe. ibang level na dahil sobrang entrenched na ang ganitong cybercrime groups sa mga data na (it’s a different level because these groups are too entrenched on data that are) supposedly secured, private and confidential,” Binay said. Binay warned such modus could extend to “something bigger and more sophisticated scheme.” “Nakakatakot na (It’s already scary),” she said, adding that she plans to inquire on the concrete solutions being undertaken by responsible government agencies to restrict such activities. “The unabated digital scams will erode the trustworthiness of electronic commerce and may reverse our shift to a digital economy. It is the right of our people to have safe digital ecosystem and it is the duty of the government to provide and secure such an environment,” she said.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Senator Robinhood “Robin” C. Padilla has filed a bill outlining safety measures and other benefits for workers in the Philippine entertainment industry to protect the welfare of actors and workers in the industry. Padilla, who started in the “showbiz” industry in the 1980s, dubbed his Senate Bill 450 the “Eddie Garcia Law” in memory of the veteran actor who died in 2019. “The bill, called ‘Eddie Garcia Law’ as a tribute to the veteran actor, is a response to the urgent call of the members of the television and movie industry for the government to provide guidelines for safe and better working conditions for the protection of the workers’ welfare in the industry,” Padilla, chairman the Senate committee on public information and mass media, said.   The bill got the support of Joel Egco, former president of the National Press Club (NPC) and first executive director of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security. Egco called on Padilla to author a similar bill that would ensure minimum benefits for media, adding a bill – House Bill 304 – has already been filed in the House of Representatives by Representatve Luis Villafuerte Jr. “Sana naman ay i-author din ni Senator Padilla itong ating nabinbin na panukalang batas media workers welfare bill. Lahat na media supportive din sa Eddie Garcia bill (I hope Senator Padilla also authors a bill for media workers’ welfare. All media workers are supportive of the Eddie Garcia bill),” Egco said in an interview on DZRJ. “Hindi matatawaran ang kondisyon ng ating mga kapatid sa media kasama ang nagtatrabaho sa larangan ng pelikula at TV at papalawig at papalakas ng demokrasya (We cannot discount the condition of our brethren in in the media as well as in show business, amid their role in strengthening our democracy),” he added.   In his bill, Padilla lamented that Garcia, a veteran and multi-awarded actor, died following an accident on set due to supposed negligence on safety in the workplace. Padilla said this is aside from the work conditions in the industry including long hours for shooting, low pay, stress, and overnight and overtime work. “These work conditions pose risks to the safety, health, and even life of workers. Most recent of which was the unfortunate death of Mr. Eddie Garcia, a veteran and multi-awarded actor who was met by an unfortunate accident on set due to supposed negligence on safety in the workplace. The death of other known personalities, Director Gilbert Perez in 2008 and Directors Wenn Deramas and Francis Xavier Pasion in 2016, were also attributed to poor working conditions in the industry,” he noted. Under the bill, Workers or Independent Contractors (WIC) will be protected in the workplace during work hours. They are also entitled to benefits, safety, and fair compensation. Normal work hours will be eight hours in a day, extendable to 12 hours. WICs aged 60 and up may work more than 12 hours provided the sign a waiver prescribed by the Department of Labor and Employment. Minors cannot work more than 60 hours a week. A night shift premium of 10 percent of the WIC’s rate will be paid for every hour worked between 10 PM and 6 AM. There will also be ample time for rest, lasting at least 12 hours.   Employees are covered by benefits from the Social Security System (SSS), Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, along with retirement benefits. Meanwhile, employers are to shoulder costs for the WICs’ needs including food, water, PWD-friendly and gender-considerate toilets, private dressing rooms, safe holding areas with emergency exits, free accommodation, and dedicated emergency vehicles. The bill also mandates the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) officer of the employee to conduct a risk assessment of the workplace to prevent possible hazards. On the other hand, WICs can form labor organizations for collective bargaining and mutual aid benefit. For its part, the DOLE shall establish a Film, Television and Radio Entertainment Industry Tripartite Council to act as a link among stakeholders and to resolve potential conflicts.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto believes that Filipinos will benefit if the rightsizing policy gets implemented on the national police force for the purpose of deploying more cops on the streets. Recto, in a statement Monday, Sept. 5, said the Philippine National Police (PNP) plans to “hire, arm and deploy” 14,208 new officers next year. If the PNP will succeed in hiring that many personnel, “it will be the biggest in years,” the House leader said. The PNP will have 227,410 men and women in uniform next year, he said, adding that the new hires will bring the police officer-to-population ratio to 1:494. The ideal ratio is 1:500. Recto backed “the hiring approach of filling all vacant positions first because there is no use in funding the creation of many new positions when these are barely filled within the fiscal year.” Referring to the 1:494 ratio, Recto noted that this is only “on paper”. “Kasama sa bilang ang mga nasa headquarters at administrative support. Mas mababa ang bilang ng mga pulis na in any given hour ay na naka-duty (The number includes those staying inside the headquarters and administrative support. The number of police who are on duty in any given hour are fewer),” the Batangueño said. This, he stressed, underscores the need for a “rightsizing exercise” that will free up many police officers from administrative work and deploy them for community policing, on the ground, where they are needed. The hiring will cost taxpayers P5.18 billion, “in initial salary alone, not including training and equipment,” Recto said. While index crimes went down during the pandemic, from 43,912 in 2020 to 37,842 in 2021, “there were still 22 rape cases, 14 robbery cases, 14 murder victims a day last year,” the former senator said.

Manila Bulletin,"One of the most crucial agencies when it comes to disaster preparedness will get a major boost in funds if and when this measure from 1-Pacman Party-list Rep. Mikee Romero gets enacted. Romero filed House Bill (HB) No. 3588, which seeks to provide an additional P2 billion worth of modernization funds to PAGASA to ensure that the country fulfills its commitments to international meteorological and climate change agreements. “The government must undertake the modernization of PAGASA in order for the agency to improve its technological operational capacity, strengthen its role as the premier national weather agency and to attain its vision as a center of excellence for weather-related information services,” reckoned the veteran solon. He explained that PAGASA is the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) agency of the country that is primarily mandated to provide protection against all natural calamities and to assure the safety, well-being and economic security of all the people, and for the promotion of national progress. The agency does so by undertaking scientific and technological services in meteorology, hydrology, climatology, astronomy and other geophysical sciences. Romero noted that there is also a need to strengthen the capability of government personnel tasked to provide atmospheric, geophysical, astronomical and other weather and climate-related services and information to the public. Under the proposed measure, the PAGASA modernization fund would be sourced from the following: The amount of P2 billion to be taken from the share of the National Government in the gross income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor).   For two years after the effectivity of the Act, the amount of P1 billion per year should be released to PAGASA. The entire amount of P2 billion, including any interest income thereon, should be used exclusively for capital outlay. Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, the Philippines is visited by an average of 20 typhoons every year.    ",0

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Sunday made a “symbolic” state visit here when he first had a meet-and-greet with the Filipino community before meeting his Indonesian counterpart President Joko Widodo. Speaking to Filipinos who gathered to see him, Marcos Jr. promised to campaign for their welfare and protection to return the favor they made when they supported him during the campaign. “Kaya’t upang makabawi man lang nang konti, kahit na nakaboto na kayo, ikakampanya ko pa rin kayo (To return the favor, I would campaign for you),” he said. A lively crowd, repeatedly cheering “BBM,” turned even livelier when they finally saw Marcos Jr. at around 4:45 p.m. The President was accompanied by his wife, Liza Araneta-Marcos, who changed her outfit from a violet dress when they arrived to a black and red ensemble; and son and Senior Deputy Majority Leader Sandro. A familiar song played during Marcos Jr.’s campaign, Bagong Lipunan, was also played during the gathering. Department of Migrant Workers Secretary Susan “Toots” Ople, who is part of Marcos’ delegation, called the trip “symbolic” because “just on his first day, he chose to see the overseas Filipino workers.”   “It tells a lot of his concern to our workers. He remembered after the elections, he did not forget to check on them,” Ople said in a press conference. Marcos said he chose Sunday to be his arrival day, so Filipinos were having their rest day and could see him. In his message to the Filipino community, the President acknowledged the OFWs’ contribution to the nation as well as to the economy. “Kami naman ay laging nagpapasalamat na ang inyong sakripisyo ay patuloy pa rin ninyong ginagawa, pinapakita ninyo ang pinakamagandang ugali ng Pilipino at ito ay nagbibigay bunga sa pagtulong sa ating mga kababayan na naiwan sa Pilipinas (We’re always thankful for your sacrifice, for showing good Filipino traits and for helping your fellow in the Philippines),” he said.

Manila Bulletin,"The Court of Appeals (CA) has voided two search warrants issued by the Quezon City regional trial court (RTC) that led to the seizure of firearms, ammunition and explosives allegedly in possession of three human rights activists who were arrested in Manila in 2019 and charged criminally in court. In a decision written by Associate Justice Emily L. San Gaspar-Gito, the CA also reversed the ruling of the Manila RTC, where the cases were filed, which denied the plea of activists Ram Carlo Bautista, Alma Moran, and Reina Mae Nasino to suppress the illegally seized evidence and to nullify the search warrants. Bautista, Moran and Nasino were arrested on Nov. 5, 2019 in Tondo, Manila on the basis of search warrants issued by Judge Cecilyn Burgos-Villavert of Quezon City RTC. Seized in their alleged possession were one hand grenade, a .45 caliber pistol and magazine with live ammunition, a Bushmaster M16 5.56 mm rifle with magazine and live ammunition and several other alleged illegal items.   Criminal cases were filed against them before the Manila RTC for violations of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended by Republic Act No. 9516 (An Act Further Amending the Provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, entitled ‘Codifying The Laws on Illegal/Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Dealing In, Acquisition or Disposition of Firearms, Ammunition or Explosives or Instruments Used in the Manufacture of Firearms, Ammunition or Explosives, and Imposing Stiffer Penalties for Certain Violations Thereof…) and R.A. 10591 (An Act Providing For A Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof). They pleaded to nullify the search warrants and to suppress the use of alleged evidence reportedly seized in their possession. They told the trial court, among other things, that search was illegal because it was done at an address different from that stated in the warrant; that the evidence seized during the search are inadmissible because they “fruits of a poisonous tree;” the warrants were invalid for lack of specificity of the place to the search and the items subject of the search; and the search was invalid because it was not conducted in the presence of the lawful occupant or done in the presence of two witnesses. When their plea to quash the search warrants and to suppress the evidence seized during the implementation of the warrants were denied by Manila RTC Judge Marivic T. Balisi-Umali, they filed a petition with the CA. At the time of her arrest, Nasino was pregnant. In detention, she delivered a baby girl on July 1, 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Manila City RTC denied Nasino’s petition to be with her newly-born child either at the hospital of inside her jail dormitory to be able to breastfeed her.   Nasino elevated the issue before the CA which dismissed her petition on account of mootness since the baby had died and had been buried. On the criminal charges as a result of the two search warrants, the three activists denied the charges against them and pointed out they were arrested without a warrant of arrest. They told the CA that the firearms, ammunition and explosives do not belong to them and were just planted by the raiding team. In granting their petition, nullifying the search warrants, and suppressing the use as evidence of the items seized during the search, the CA said: “The right against unreasonable searches and seizures is one of the fundamental constitutional rights that remains constant despite the everchanging Constitution of our country, from the 1899 Malolos Constitution to the present 1987 Constitution. “The protection afforded by the right was further reinforced by its recognition as a basic human right under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to both of which the Philippines has given its imprimatur. “Both the Convention and the Declaration recognize a person’s right against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one’s privacy and property. “Courts are therefore expected to be vigilant in preventing its stealthy encroachment or gradual depreciation and ensure that the safeguards put in place for its protection are observed. We do so today. “A search under the strength of a warrant is required to be witnessed by the lawful occupant of the premises sought to be searched. It must be stressed that it is only upon their absence that their presence may be replaced by two (2) persons of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality. “In the present case, petitioners were actually present in the place but what is disconcerting is that petitioner Bautista was required to leave the room while the search was being conducted. It was only later on that he was called and the items seized were shown to him. This is irregular. “Thus, the argument of respondent People that the subject Search Warrants specifically identified petitioner Bautista’s house does not hold water. To the point of being repetitive, the subject Search Warrants indicated the wrong address and with the wrong description, which resulted to the improper implementation thereof. “The implementation of the subject Search Warrants is further marred by irregularities committed by the officers in the actual conduct of the search. Notably, the search in petitioner Bautista’s room was not made in his presence, as he was brought downstairs. It was only when he was brought back to his room, this time in the presence of the barangay officials, that the seized items were shown to him. Not having seen the actual search conducted on his room, he wrote ‘UP’ when he signed the two (2) Certification of Orderly Search, indicating he was signing them ‘Under Protest.’ “Meanwhile, on the part of petitioners Moran and Nasino, they were hand-tied and made to lie face down during the search conducted in their rooms. “It should be stressed that the subject Search Warrants were addressed to petitioner Bautista only. Notwithstanding so, petitioners Moran and Nasino were likewise subjected to the search and several items, which were not in plain view, were allegedly confiscated from them. “Clearly, petitioners’ right against unreasonable search and seizures was blatantly trampled upon. “Another fact worth mentioning is that while the address in the subject Search Warrants indicate Brgy. 183, the barangay officials who were present during the search were from Brgy. 178, thus further emphasizing the point that the address in the subject Search Warrants is erroneous. “With the erroneous addresses that were never clarified, there isbut one logical conclusion, i.e., the applicant and his witnesses did not really have personal knowledge of the surrounding facts which would have justified the issuance of the subject Search Warrants. Consequently, the existence of probable cause is doubtful. “WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing disquisition, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The Orders dated July 1, 2020 and July 22, 2020 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. “Search Warrants Nos. 5944 (19) and 5945 (19) are declared VOID for failure to meet the standards of a valid search warrant, and all evidence procured by virtue thereof are deemed inadmissible.SO ORDERED.” Associate Justices Eduardo B. Peralta Jr. and Walter S. Ong concurred in the decision.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Stressing the roles of nurses during a public health crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, Rizal 4th District Rep. Fidel Nograles on Sunday, Sept. 4, vowed to address the issues surrounding their pay hike and the wage disparity between public and private nurses. In a statement, the lawmaker promised that Congress would help President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in fulfilling his promises to the nurses when he attended the 100th anniversary of the Philippine Nurses Association, Inc. recently. Nograles said Congress must work closely with the executive branch to improve the working conditions of nurses. “Makakaasa ang bansa na makikipagtulungan tayo sa Pangulo upang mapatotoo ang matagal nang inaasam ng ating mga nurse na mapabuti ang kalagayan nila, pangunahin na ang pagpapataas ng kanilang sahod (The country can expect that we will work with the President to realize the long-awaited dreams of our nurses to improve their working conditions, especially increasing their salaries),” he added.   The lawmaker, who chairs the House Committee on Labor, also wants to address the wage disparity between nurses in the public and private sectors after noting that entry-level nurses in public hospitals get P35,000 monthly, while private nurses only receive P12,000 a month. Nurses in the provinces reportedly receive lower wages and even less benefits.  “We in the legislative will look at how we can intervene to establish a better working environment for our nurses,” Nograles said, lamenting that as much as the Philippines has a lot of nurses, the health institutions still suffer.   “We have to find out what we can do to avoid such impasse, and avoid crippling our healthcare system because our nurses do not wish to work here,” the lawmaker added. However, the solon recognized that the private sector cannot afford the same pay as government hospitals pay their healthcare workers, and that passing a law mandating them to do it won’t address the issue. Such disparity, which has gone on for years, is pushing nurses to seek better employment opportunities abroad, Nograles said. “We have seen during the height of the pandemic how this can be a problem, with our nurses refusing to work here despite increased demand as their salaries are not commensurate to the service they render, especially during a public health crisis where such service can endanger their lives and that of their families,” the lawmaker added. Nograles expressed hope that Congress could find a “workable solution” that all stakeholders could be satisfied with.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman George Garcia said they will push for internet voting for Filipinos abroad. In a television interview, the poll chief expressed belief that internet voting will help increase the voter turnout for overseas voting as many of the voters have difficulty casting their votes personally or via postal voting. “If internet voting will be allowed…we believe that the overseas voter turnout will be higher,” Garcia said. “During the last elections, the overseas voter turnout was at 29 percent. It would be better if we can provide another alternative,” he added. “Certainly, it will be better if we can push for the use of internet voting for Filipinos abroad,” said Garcia. But, he said, the final say will always come from Congress.   The Comelec conducted a series test runs for overseas internet voting last year.  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) has highlighted the significant role of local government units (LGUs) for the successful implementation of the administration’s program to address the country’s housing backlog and resettle informal settler families (ISFs) to safer grounds. During the two-day visit of DHSUD Secretary Jose Acuzar to the Visayas Region, he and officials of the agency went to key cities and met with local chief executives. “Major cities and provinces in Visayas recorded a significant number of informal settler families (ISFs) and people living in calamity-prone areas. So it is a must to also prioritize the Visayas group of islands,” he said. According to the DHSUD, the administration’s priority is addressing the over 6.5 million housing backlog, including the estimated 3.7 million ISFs throughout the country. Acuzar said that the majority of local leaders committed to supporting the Marcos administration’s housing blueprint and expressed their willingness to allot land resources for the development of new project sites, such as converting esteros into parks and walkways to aid in the restoration and rehabilitation of waterways. He expressed bullishness that the LGUs will help in alleviating the lives of ISFs.   “I am confident on the help of our LGUs to develop and transform these informal settlements into prime residential and world-class developments for the benefit of our countrymen especially those in the low-income bracket,” he said. Some of the local executives met by the DHSUD secretary were Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes, Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez, Bacolod City Mayor Albee Benitez, Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Trenas, and Iloilo Governor Art Defensor.

Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has named former Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. as the new Philippine Ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Malacañang confirmed. Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles made this confirmation on Sunday morning, September 4. Based on a copy of his appointment paper dated August 30, 2022, Locsin will have concurrent jurisdiction over Ireland, the Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Jersey, and Bailiwick of Guernsey. Before his appointment, Locsin, a veteran journalist, served as the third Foreign Affairs Secretary of former president Rodrigo Duterte. He replaced Senator Alan Peter Cayetano in 2018 when the latter ran for Congress and sought the House Speaker position. Duterte’s first Foreign Affairs Secretary was the late Perfecto Yasay Jr.   Locsin was also the Philippines’ ambassador to the United Nations before taking over the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Sherwin Gatchalian has urged the Senate to start an investigation into the sudden proliferation of spam and phishing text messages that many consumers have been complaining about since it now includes the receiver’s name.   “It is alarming that while major telecommunication providers claim to have already blocked a significant number of spam and phishing text messages, the problem continues to hound many telco subscribers,” Gatchalian said. The senator noted that the latest spam and phishing messages have evolved to include the receiver’s name compared to previous random transmission of messages.   Gatchalian said the inclusion of the receiver’s name indicates a breach of consumers’ right to privacy and this breach stirs fear that their personal details may have already been compromised. Thus, the government must come up with an effective mechanism to stop the spam messages which contain information that appears to come from reputable or reliable source and attempts to obtain a user’s sensitive information such as username, passwords, and credit card details, he said. Gatchalian noted that in November 2021, an interagency group was created led by the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) to address the problem. Part of the interagency group are the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), National Privacy Commission (NPC), National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), Department of Justice (DOJ), National Security Council, and Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), among others. But despite the existence of the inter-agency group, and the NPC’s initiatives to investigate the proliferation of spam and phishing messages, he said the same privacy issues continue to hound consumers. For instance, he said PLDT Inc. claimed to have blocked more than 23 million text messages in four days for attempting to get consumers’ personal data. On the other hand, Globe Telecom also said it blocked over 138 million spam and scam text messages over a six-month period from January to June this year. “Malinaw na hindi sapat ang mga hakbang na ginawa ng inter-agency group upang matugunan ang problemang ito dahil ang mga subscribers ay patuloy na nakakatanggap ng mga spam at phishing messages (It’s clear that the policies carried put by the inter-agency group is not enough to solve the problem because subscribers continue to receive spam and phishing messages,” he said. “Higit pang mga interbensyon ang kailangan gawin ng gobyerno para epektibong matuldukan ang mga ganitong mga gawain (The government should come up with better interventions to put a stop to these act  ",0
Manila Bulletin,"Vice President Sara Duterte has been designated as officer-in-charge (OIC) while President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. undertakes his series of state visits in Indonesia and Singapore until Sept. 7. In a special order signed by Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Marcos designated Duterte as OIC to “ensure continuity of government service” while he is away. Duterte will take care of the day-to-day operations in the Office of the President and oversee the general administration of the Executive Department. “The Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines shall act as a Officer-in-Charge to take care of the day-to-day operations in the Office of the President and oversee the general administration of the Executive Department, and shall, if necessary, act for and on behalf of the President, except on matters that the President is required by the Constitution to act in person, during the time that the President is outside of the Republic of the Philippines from 04-07 September 2022,” Special Order No. 75 stated. The special order also directed all departments, agencies and instrumentalities of the government to assist the Vice President in the discharge of her functions. The order also noted that all acts of the Vice President for and on behalf of the President shall be deemed acts of the President, “unless disapproved or reprobated by the President.”   The special order was signed on Sept. 2, two days before Marcos left for Indonesia.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Imee Marcos on Sunday called on the Department of Agriculture (DA) to speed up the release of almost P9-billion worth of government subsidies particularly for rice farmers who are now preparing for the wet planting season.   Marcos said rice farmers who have reached out to her office complained that the P5,000 cash assistance allocated for some 1.6 million farmers was slow in coming. This, even after the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has announced the availability of the subsidy.   Marcos said the DA should not put farmers’ funds in time deposit since they are not meant to earn any interest. “Huwag nang i-time deposit ang pondo para sa mga magsasaka at hindi naman yan para tumubo ng interest sa bangko. Paspasan na ang pag release niyan (Don’t put farmers’ subsidy funds in a time deposit since it isn’t meant to earn bank interest. Expedite the release, right now),” Marcos said. The DA’s problem with its identification system was allegedly the problem why the funds could not be released, according to the LandBank of the Philippines.   But if the DA lacks the capability to update its Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA), Marcos said the agency should call on municipal agriculturists who have the list of farmers’ cooperatives in their areas of responsibility. She said the RSBSA’s list of individual farmers given access to fertilizer and seed subsidies should not exclude but continue to support those whose livelihood has grown into value-added products. The senator warned there could be low farm yields and even food shortages if farmers are unable to use their subsidies to buy fertilizers and other farm inputs. “The DA is creating bigger problems for itself if it delays the release of farmer subsidies,” Marcos warned. “Farm yields for the country’s staple crops cannot be maintained, much less increased, if farmers can’t afford fertilizers and quit their livelihood,” she pointed out.

Manila Bulletin,"The government should do its part in producing more high quality and higher paying jobs in the country in order to make a serious dent in the unemployment and underemployment rate in the country, especially among the youth. Senator Sonny Angara made this assertion as he stressed that the government cannot be content with just pushing for the creation of the same low paying jobs in the same industries. During the recent hearing of the Senate Committee on Youth, Angara noted that majority of the jobs being occupied by Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 30 are some of the lowest paying in the country. Citing Philippine Statistics Authority, the senator noted there are 13.8 million total employed youth in the country and the top industries where they are employed are wholesale and retail, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; agriculture and forestry; construction; manufacturing; and administrative and support service activities.   In 2021, the PSA noted that 17.2 percent of the Filipino youth were unemployed while 14.7 percent were underemployed. Based on PSA’s definition, underemployment refers to employed individuals who are still looking for additional work hours or other jobs that can provide them with additional work hours. “Looking at the top industries, clearly these are not high paying, high quality jobs,” said Angara, who chairs the youth panel.   “Problema pa din yan kasi ibig sabihin hindi pa din nila napapakain ang kanilang mga pamilya o kaya hindi pa sapat yung kinikita nila sa kanila mga pangangailangan (The problem here is that it means they still cannot provide for their family or their salary is insufficient to cover their personal needs),” he further said. According to Angara, this the reason why there is a high underemployment rate among the youth, which the PSA estimates to be at 2.02 million in 2021. “It’s clear to me that the quality of jobs that we produce is what we should be looking after. We should be asking ourselves and our government agencies should be asking themselves what we can do to help enable the private sector to produce higher paying, higher quality jobs,” Angara said. Angara also noted that young people who lose their jobs or fail to obtain jobs are particularly vulnerable to “scarring”, citing a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO). “Scarring”, he said, refers to the phenomenon where their future labor market outcomes are worse than those of their peers even when the economic conditions where they are situated improve. The lawmaker said these young Filipino workers are likely to end up accepting jobs for which they are overqualified, which puts them at risk of being trapped in an employment trajectory that involves informality and low pay. “What we need to do is to have the government agencies involved in job creation to help the private sector, particularly the industries and entrepreneurs, to create higher paying jobs for Filipinos,” Angara said. He said this is possible by redirecting public investments towards digital, care and green economies that would not only produce a significant amount of new jobs, but also provide a boost to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) over time.

Manila Bulletin,"The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has ordered the closure of an alleged illegal recruitment agency in Makati City, which it said, has been victimizing Filipino households and skilled workers going to Saudi Arabia. DMW Secretary Susan Ople said she ordered the Anti-illegal Recruitment Branch (AIRB) to lock up the Azizzah International Manpower Services, Inc., upon learning that it continues to recruit OFWs without valid license and accreditation from the DMW. Ople said, the agency’s license and accreditation were canceled on June 15 this year due to various infractions and complaints from job seekers, which she said was a clear violation that involve the exploitation of workers. The agency was charged with violation of Section 6 of the Republic Act No. 8042, as amended by Republic Act No. 10022. “The DMW has zero tolerance for recruitment agencies operating outside the law, existing even when its licenses have been canceled by the POEA,” said Ople. Meanwhile, Ople gave her stern warnings to recruitment agencies saying that ‘zombie’ agencies are not allowed to operate under her watch.

Manila Bulletin,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go is now pushing for the passage of a bill that seeks to establish a Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Center in every province throughout the Philippines, which would be under the supervision of the Department of Health (DOH). In filing Senate Bill No. 428, Go said he sees the necessity to continue the Duterte administration’s fight against illegal drugs and criminality, but also acknowledges the need to consider drug addicts as “victims. Go said the center shall provide care, treatment and accommodation to drug dependents; enhance their physical, psychological and social capability to cope with common problems; and provide after-care, follow-up and social reintegration services, among others.   “Drug addicts should be treated as victims in desperate need of medical, psychological, and spiritual assistance, with the goal of reintegrating back into society as healthy and productive citizens,” Go said in a statement. “Dapat bigyan po natin sila ng pagkakataon ng panibagong buhay (We need to give them a second chance in life),” he stressed. Go said he fully believes the Marcos administration would be able to continue the anti-illegal drug campaign of former President Duterte. “Lahat ng ating pinaghirapan sa loob ng anim na taon ay hindi lamang para sa ikabubuti natin ngayon kundi para sa kinabukasan ng ating mga anak at ng susunod pang henerasyon (All his efforts in the past six years is not only for our benefit for today, but for the future of our children and the next generation,” the senator stressed. Go pointed out that when the Duterte administration assumed office in 2016, it immediately addressed the major challenges besetting the Philippines, particularly the illegal drugs and high crime rate. Before the term of the Duterte administration ended, the lawmaker said the crime rate in the country decreased by 73.76 percent from 2016 to 2021, citing the record of the Philippine National Police (PNP). “Kapag nako-contain mo ‘yung illegal drugs, kasama na diyan ‘yung criminality at ‘yung korapsyon. ‘Pag lumala ‘yung drugs, babalik ‘yung criminality, at tataas ‘yung korapsyon — makokorap na po ‘yung tao (If we are able to contain illegal drugs, you are also able to address criminalitya nd corruption. If drug use continues, criminality will return, corruption cases will increase, more people would be corrupted),” Go stressed.    ",0
Manila Bulletin,"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has appointed former Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) chairperson Agnes Devanadera as the new president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Clark Development Corporation (CDC), a Palace document showed. In a letter signed by Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez dated September 1, 2022, Devanadera will also serve as a member of the CDC’s board of directors. Devanadera’s appointment to the CDC was also confirmed by Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles on Saturday evening. The CDC is a subsidiary of the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) which is tasked with managing the Clark Freeport Zone (CFZ) and Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ). Former President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Devanadera to the ERC in November 2017 and served as its chairperson until July 10 this year. She replaced Jose Vicente Salazar, who Duterte dismissed after being found guilty following charges of neglect of duty and other anomalies.   Devanadera served as former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s Solicitor General and acting justice secretary when Justice Secretary Raul Gonzalez was on medical leave. She is the 41st and first woman Philippine Solicitor General appointed by Arroyo in February 2007. In 2006, Devanadera was charged with graft for a debt agreement signed by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) and British lending firm Radstock Securities Inc. According to the case information filed by the Office of the Ombudsman, Devanadera advised the PNCC to enter into an amicable settlement with Radstock, which bought the rights to PNCC’s debt to Japanese firm Marubeni Corp., worth more than P6 billion. In May 2017, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the graft case, citing delay on the part of the Ombudsman in conducting its preliminary investigation. According to the Sandiganbayan, it took the Ombudsman more than six years to complete its preliminary investigation.   “It bears stressing that the assertion or non-assertion of the right to a speedy disposition of one’s case is just one of the factors to consider in determining whether or not the right has been violated,” the court’s resolution read.

Pinoy Trending News,"In case you missed it, when asked by Boy Abunda why the public should not vote for Marcos, Leni Robredo answered, ""In difficult times, hindi sya nagpakita"". Social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes said this entirely not true if judging by the COLLAGE fo BBM below which she said SPEAKS A THOUSAND WORDS. Reyes clarified that she may not be a Marcos loyalist like her friends, the collage below touched her to the core. Reyes confessed that what made her a President Duterte staunch supporter is his authentic concern and quick response during Yolanda and in many other calamities when he was not yet President. Reyes said that if their visit to Yolanda-stricken Tacloban coincided with BBM and in succeeding disasters, perhaps she will support BBM with same zeal like she supports Duterte. Nevertheless, she was grateful that the images of BBM came out, showing how he helped disaster affected areas in the past few years. In the spirit of fairness, Reyes acknowledged that Leni also has a collage but not as warm and candid as BBM. She said you can see genuineness of the smile of the giver and the recipient by just looking at the pictures.

Lastly, Isko assured the public he will not seek revenge against anyone. On that note, Atty.

Pinoy Trending News,"On allegation Boy Abunda is biased against the Vice President from the supporters of Leni Robredo, singer/composer and PAGCOR board member Jimmy Bondoc can't help but speak up to defend the talk show host from critics. Basically, the singer/composer just asked one simple question which is answerable by YES or NO. If the answer is NO and he was just accused of being biased by Leni her supporters, Bondoc said it only means they acknowledged Leni did terribly in the said interview. They just want to blame Boy Abunda for Leni Robredo's poor performance in the said show. If the answer is YES and indeed Boy Abunda is biased and yet Leni still accepted the invitation of Boy Abunda, that means Leni is a bad political strategist. Bondoc can only ask why did Leni accept the Boy Abunda invitation when she knew he is biased against her? Bondoc clarified he is neither pro or anti BBM but he is still thinking. He lauded BBM because knew how to avoid landmines. Bondoc wondered why Leni and his staff didn't know this? Again, the people surrounding Robredo failed to protect her. This is dangerous, Bondoc said. Bondoc confided that he is still in the process of thinking who to vote for President but dropped some hints like he is not voting for someone ""gentle"" like his friends prefer because he is still like the Duterte's style of leadership - noisy and adversarial. Bondoc hoped his friends will understand that politics has become noisy because people have now access to internet. He said he is more afraid if politics is very peaceful because that could only the government is not doing anything against the Oligarchs and the Leftists. Bondoc argued that in history, it is the Left and the Oligarchs who created organized noise, especially when their interest are under threat. One last important point made by Bondoc is blaming Boy Abunda because Leni messed up the interview is the height of denial and arrogance. You may now read Jimmy Bondoc's original FB post below. BIASED BA SI BOY ABUNDA? Isipin natin. Fairly, objectively. Tingnan natin sa DALAWANG anggulo. Una - HINDI, as in hindi siya biased; or Pangalawa - OO, biased siya. (1) Kung HINDI sya biased pero inaakusahan lang syang biased ng mga supporters ni Mam Leni - ibig sabihin, talagang inaamin ng ""pinklawans"" na pumalpak talaga ang mga sagot ni mam leni. Isinisisi lang nila kay sir Boy, pero ina-acknowledge nila na hindi maganda ang kinalabasan ng interview. In short, ""kasalanan"" ni sir Boy. (2) Kung OO, na totoong blased naman si sir Boy - ibig sabihin, hindi po talaga mahusay si Mam Leni sa politika. Bakit po siya pumayag mag-guest sa isang host na alam niyang ""biased"" against her? As I said, hindi po ako pro or anti BBM, nag-iisip pa ako. Pero at least, BBM knew how to avoid the landmines. Bakit si Mam Leni or ang staff niya, hindi alam? Again, hindi siya na protect ng mga taong nakapaligid sa kanya. Aba, delikado yan. Iniisip ko pa kung sino ang iboboto ko. Pero maliwanag po talaga sa akin kung sino ang hindi ko iboboto. And I say this will ALL DUE RESPECT to Mam Leni and her supporters. Maniwala man po sila o hindi. Nahihirapan lang ako dahil madami po talaga akong kilala na pro-Leni, at nauunawaan ko naman kung bakit. They want a more ""gentle"" administration, and they want to go back to a way of politics that is not as noisy or as adversarial as what we have now. Pero sana po, maunawaan nila na ang politika ay naging maingay all over the world because of the increased accessibility of the internet. At kung ang politika ay tahimik, mas matatakot ako, dahil ibig sabihin ay walang ginagawa ang gobyerno laban sa mga kaliwa at mga Okigarkiya. Kasi, sa kasaysayan, yang Kaliwa at Oligarkiya lang naman ang gumagawa ng organisadong INGAY tuwing nasasagasaan ang mga interest nila. Wala na pong iba. Pasensya na po sa political post. Pero, sometimes we have to speak up. Kasi, kalokohan naman na isisi pa kay Sir Boy ang mga sagot ni Mam Leni. That is the height of denial and arrogance. Everyone saw it. Boy Abunda's platform declared that they left the answers unedited, with time limits. Kay Jessica Soho, hindi po ganun ang structure. Based on that alone, there is much less reason to doubt sir Boy's platform over Jessica's. Isang maliwanag na umaga po sa lahat. Mas liliwanag po ang araw kung magpakatotoo tayo sa sarili natin.

Sonza went on to expound his assertion by citing 4 statements of Robredo made in the Boy Abunda interview which he found contradicting. For example. When asked by Abunda if she thinks the Philippines is a narco state? She replied no but the PH drug problem is gargantuan. Sonza wrote that a homeless man in Quaipo, in Raon talks more sense than Robredo and some of those from Nueve de Pebrero in Mandaluyong. Sonza joked he already downed two bottles of bourbon, and still he can't decipher Leni's statements. Sonza said in jest he felt the Kakampinks are oozing with intelligence because until now, they are still on bended knees to their Mama Leni. You may now read Sonza's original FB post below. ano ba tinatakbuhan ng ina mo? presidente ba o purok leader? ano ba tinatakbuhan ng ina mo? presidente ba o purok leader? after 2 public discourse, ala akong naunawaan sa pinagsasabi niya. (a) hindi ika narco state ang pinas, pero kabundok ang problema sa droga; (b) ayaw niya sa abortion, ngunit ok lang sa kanya kung gawin ito ng walang pananagutan; (c) ayaw niya pakipagiyera sa china, subalit nagpapakampi siya sa amerika at allied countries para pasukuhin ang tsina sa nais ng pilipinas sa south china sea; (d) payag sa mining, pero dapat hindi makinabang iyong negosyanteng nangapital at mga pilipino (gobyerno), kundi iyong mga lumad/natibo lamang. mas matino pang kausap iyong taong grasa sa may quiapo church, sa may raon, sa maynila, english speaking nga lang. mas may sense pang kausap iyong ilang taga nueve de pebrero, sa may mandaluyong. utang na loob, nakakadalawang bote na ako ng jim beam bourbon, hindi ko pa rin ma-decipher iyong mga statement ni madam. parang pakiramdam ko, ubod ng talino ng mga kakampink, kasi hanggang ngayon tiklop -tuhod pa sila sa ina nila.

Pinoy Trending News,"Well, well, well. The #IStandwithGuanzon is trending on Twitter, thanks to the Kakampinks who are quick to run to the defense of their own kind by turning to what they do best, make hashtags of their choice trends using organic traffic and you already what. The admin of the FB page AllWrite urged his followers to torch the #IStandwithGuanzon BS of the Kakampinks. Turned out, his ace card was the rebuttal of Commissioner Aimee Ferolino on the issue and that is, Commissioner Guanzon has repeatedly told her to adopt her opinion which we already know was to disqualify BBM. In other words, Ferolino is accusing Guanzon of trying to influence her decision on the case. AllWrite realized now why Guanzon used the ""fraternity card"" in her spat with Atty. Briones of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas because she was hiding something. AllWrite concluded that Guanzon's histrionics on Twitter, discussing the merits of the pending DQ case of BBM in public is because she is begging for public sympathy so that in case she will be impeached or disbarred, she will have the sympathy of the public. Here are some of the comments of netizens. Shame on you Rowena Guanzon, it's unethical way para mangulit ka at mamilit sa DQ ni BBM. Kaya ikaw Hindi naka nakatiis, pinapangunahan mo SC. nasaan Ang Respeto???? #istandwithcomferlino#disbarGuanzon influence pala ha ending si shunga pala ang nagiinfluence... dilawan pa more ganyan gusto Nila starting chaos gulo and then blame BBM they're trying to play the same game they did with PFEM siraan ng siraan Ang kawawang tao Sunogin natin yang #IStandwithGuanzon BS ng mga KAKAMPOTA. Ito ang panig ni Commissioner Aimee Ferolino. It is not ""undue delay"", but ""undue rush."" It is commissioner Rowena Guanzon who is consistently telling the Commissioner to adopt her opinion. Kaya pala natakot na patulan ni Atty. Briones at ginamit ang ""fraternity"" card dahil may tinatago pala. If an impeachable officer discussing in public the merits of the case pending before her. It means one thing: She's begging for public's sympathy so that in any reason she will be impeached or disbarred, people will back her up. #IStandwithGuanzon is for shunga only. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"An open letter addressed to Leni Robredo penned by a seaman named Lacruiser P. Relativo in reaction to the Vice President's statement in the Boy Abunda interview has been making the rounds on Facebook. The open letter has generated 7,100+ reactions, a few comments and 2,700+ shares in just 3 hours and counting. You may now read Relativo's open letter below. Open letter to VP Leni Robredo Napanuod ko ang inyong panayam kay Boy Abunda sa usaping OFW. Gusto nyong maglatag ng programa para sa aming mga seafarers. Dahil nakikita ninyo na mas marami ang nasa mababang posisyon kesa opisyal Mainam pero may nais lamang po akong sabihin: Lahat naman kami nagsimula sa pinakamababang posisyon. Proud akong taga segragate ng basura. Taga grasa ng kable. Taga tapon ng foodwaste. Taga katok ng di maubos ubos na kalawang. Tagalinis, mula accommodation hanggang sa bodega. Ginawa namin lahat ng yan para sa pangarap at makatulong sa pamilya. I do not demean my colleagues who are in the lower ranks VP Leni. They all make a good team and family onboard. Para sa akin ang tagumpay ay para sa lahat ng nangangarap mapa-ratings man o opisyal Tagumpay na maituturing ang maitaguyod mo ang iyong pamilya sa trabahong malinis at marangal. Sana lang huwag ninyo kaming gamiting 'materyal' para sa kagustuhan ninyong manalo at magamit ang pondong nakalaan para sa amin. Naaalala ko, during oath-taking namin sa Manila Hotel. May bisitang Aquino. Ang laman ng kanyang talumpati ay hindi para sa amin. At kung meron man, ni-isa walang natupad. Wala! Alam namin ang industriyang ito dahil kami ang nasa frontline. Tanging ang pag upo ng Pangulong Duterte nagkaron ng bahagyang pagbabago. Naging 10 years na ang validity ng seaman's book at passport. Nagkaroon ng bagong gusali at dumami ang branches ng MARINA. Naalis ang mga substandard na training centers. Sa gitna ng pandemya, hindi kami iniwan mula sa pag alis at pag uwi. Nariyan ang pakikipagtulungan ng MARINA at OWWA mula sa airport hanggang makauwi sa aming mga probinsya. At kung kayo man ang ma swerteng mabubunot na uupo sa pagka presidente, unahin nyo ang ang pagtuwid sa mga balikong maritime companies na syang tunay na mapagsamantala sa marinong Pilipino. Idagdag nyo na ang napakamahal at insignificant na trainings. Tanggalin nyo ang lisensya ng mga diagnostic centers na binibigyan ng sakit ang mga marino para lang magkapera. Ilan lamang ito sa maraming bagay na aming pinaglalaban kasama ang pamilyang umaasa sa amin. Sa huli VP Leni, salamat sa pagbanggit sa amin sa inyong panayam. Hindi namin alam kung matutupad ang binitawang pangako kung sakaling kayo'y maupo, ngunit malaki ang aming paniniwala na magpapatuloy ang magandang nasimulan ng adminitrasyong Duterte at sa susunod na ka alyado nito. Ganon pa man, patuloy ang aming paglalayag hindi lang sa pansariling pangarap ngunit sa tawag ng karagatan. This is the only way to fulfill the grand purpose from the day we were born. So help us God. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"Former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao fell short of calling BBM's decision to decline to join a so-called debate organized by GMA Network hosted by Jessica Soho BRILLIANT, whether it was deliberate or not. Tiglao said that move by BBM sent a strong signal to the media that he is not desperate for media coverage like others do, he does not fear them and lastly, he is head and shoulders above his presidential rivals who were so willing to be part in that mindless show. For refusing to be in that silly talk show, he becomes the talk of the town while the other three who looked like desperate for media mileage were quickly forgotten, Tiglao argued. BBM's brilliance did not stop here. BBM accepting an interview in a more intelligent program, created even more hype because of the controversy he created for declining the Jessica Soho show. The hype resulted in more views for Boy Abunda's interview, watched by a really huge number of voters and still gaining more and more views. Ambassador Tiglao ended the FB post by asking netizens how can his rivals beat that? You may now read Amb. Bobi Tiglao's original FB post below. Deliberate tactic or not, BBM declined to join a so-called debate where candidates are asked inane questions. He therefore sent the messages that he isn't desperate to have media coverage as the other candidates do, that he does not fear media (which are very mistrusted by the masses, surveys point out), that he is a cut above others who were so willing to be in that mindless show. By not being in that inane talk show, he becomes the talk of the town, and the three who joined are forgotten. And then he immediately accepts an interview in a more intelligent program, which because of the controversy he created in declining the JH show apparently is viewed by a really HUGE number of voters. Can you beat that? ",1

Number 1, nagsalita about 'di nagpakita in difficult moments' yung hindi macancel ang party niya sa Amerika kahit binabagyo na yung lugar niya. Wow!

Pinoy Trending News,"HALA SYA NAGALIT KAY BOY ABUNDA Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu pretended surprised that Actress Rita Avila was utterly disappointed with Boy Abunda for allegedly cutting off Leni Robredo while answered to his questions. It looked like to her, Abunda did not want Robredo to expound her answer. Very sad. Avila confessed to Boy Abunda that she defended him from critics, that he is professional and respectful to whoever his guest. Chu's shared FB post attracted comments even from officials of the Duterte government who are very active on social media like Usec. Cualoping of the PIA (Philippine Information Agency) and Arnel Ignacio alias DA Arnell Ign on FB of OWWA. Tito Boy, stay strong! - Usec. Mon Cualoping wow hindi talaga pumasa si Boy abunda sa standard mo ha - Arnel Ignacio Anong i-expound nya???? - Sass Rogando Sasot/International relations expert and political analyst and blogger A few hours later, Rita Avila commented on the shared post of Krizette Chu to defend herself, denying he called Boy Abunda ""bastos"" or disrespectful and read: Ooops check my post, wala ako sinabing ""bastos"". Post ng iba un na nirepost ko. Marami ang nakapansin ng ginawa ni Boy. Even VP Leni had to tell him na ""hayaan mo muna ako magpaliwanag ha?"" (Something to that effect) bec. ramdam nya ang pag-cut lagi sa kanya. Boy spoke a lot, nasobrahan. And pls, ung argument ng iba na dahil lihis naman ang mga sagot ni VP kaya sha kina-cut... excuse me, a proper host doesn't do that. Winner pa din sha sa mga sagot nya. Anti-Leni lang kayo. Rita Avila's comment generated 363 replies from netizens as of this writing. na cut dahil sobrang layo nang sagot n'ya sa tanong. Gets mo? Panuorin mo maigi. Wag ka maging fanatic d'yan. Iboto mo pero wag naman sana pati sa katangahan dedepensahan mo. Ginawa naman ni Boy Abunda sa lahat ng guest yan. Sadyang ***** Lang sumagot manok niyo. Hirap na bang ipagtanggol kaya si Boy Abunda na lang sisisihin niyo? Ganyan kayooooo. Wala kay Tito Boy ang problema, nakay Mamili I saw the interview...and to be honest...not a good speaker and most of all cannot lead the country... Ms. Rita, with all due respect. I grew up really admiring your acting but, leni is doing self destruction, she kept answering just to answer with no substance and not even related to the question. Now if you can't see this, majority of the people can. And if tito boy wasn't doing what he did.. leni should have said more that will make her stand for presidency worse than yesterday.(I'm not saying she's got it because she doesnt). She kept explaining something but her explanation is not for reality. It seems like she's created a whole universe just for herself and you and her supporters are in it.❤❤❤❤ Leni should be thanking him. Boy Abunda was guiding her back to the topic. Kaka-""expound"" nya di nya na nasasagot yung tanong agad, nauubusan sya ng oras. And what would have been the better approach of the host in times like that? Boy Abunda did very well. Also, he was very respectful and helpful. Si Leni lang tlga ang mahirap kausap. Mahaba magsalita pero hindi agad naaaddress ang issues. Rita Avila paano maka expound c fvpleni kng ang sagot paikot ikot dipo bah merong time limit bawat isa sa kanila kaya tinulongan ni boy abunda para matauhan di na paikot ikot un parin lutang paano un wlang magandang naidulot sa inyo mahirapan kayo mag defense sa kanya kasi wala eiili dimo tiga makuha kuha kng bakit ganoon sasagot c fvp kaya huwag nah magdismayado mas lalo ka lang po mahihirapan mam kaya yon pinuputol ni Tito Boy dahil umikot ikot lng ang sagot nya tinutulungan pa nga po sya ni Tito boy sumagot eh... ang babaw pa ng ibang sagot parang hnd presidente ang tatakbuhin nya...para pong PTA President sa school lng ang tatakbuhin nya...

Pinoy Trending News,"The admin of the FB page AllWrite has offered an intriguing theory that the driving force behind BBM's candidacy is PEOPLE POWER. To back up this theory, AllWrite headed to YouTube to look at the views generated by Boy Abunda's interview of BBM versus the video of the Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews streamed on GMA Public Affairs official YouTube account. To his surprised, Boy Abunda's interview with BBM generated 4.7M views in just 20 hours compared to the Jessica Soho Presidential Interview which generated 6M views in 3 days. Yes, 3 days. To think that the GMA Public Affairs official YouTube channel which streamed The Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews has 17.9 million subscribers compared to The Boy Abunda channel with only 1.18 million subscribers. AllWrite argued that if people are really interested to hear from what the other candidates has to say or offer, Jessica Soho's interview should easily get 5 times the number of what BBM's interview with Boy Abunda is generating. AllWrite further argued that more views generally means more interests. More interests means more people are paying attention, which is precisely what the UniTeam of BBM and Sara is advocating: UNITY AMONG FILIPINOS. You may now read AllWrite's original FB post below. The Boy Abunda Channel only has 1.18M subscribers, but Bongbong Marcos interview alone already garnered 4.7M views in just 20 hours. GMA Public Affairs, which features The Jessica Soho Interview with the Top 5 Presidential Candidates, has 17.9M subscribers, but as you can see only 6M views in three days. This convinces me that the driving force behind BBM's presidency is PEOPLE POWER!! If people are truly interested in hearing from the other presidential candidates, Jessica Soho's interview views should be five times higher. But, that's not the case. More views generally means more interests. More interest indicates that more people are paying attention. This is precisely what the Uniteam2022 advocates: UNITY AMONG ITS PEOPLE. #BBMSARA2022 #BBM2022 #GoBBM #MarcosPaRin ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of the official statement of GMA News praising ""The Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews"" as special that set the bar high for future elections, Atty. Trixie Cruz-Angeles of the Luminous can't help but burst the bubble of GMA News in its latest FB post. Atty. Trixie opened by defining the word 'HYPE' to give readers a hint the direction her post is heading to. Atty. Trixie wrote that the succeeding presidential interviews exposed the disappointing quality of the highly touted ""Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews"" describing it kind of shallow and showbiz. In other words, GMA News statement giving Jessica Soho show was nothing but borne out of necessity for damage control purposes. Atty. Trixie gave the highly touted ""Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews"" the benefit of the doubt, saying the disappointing quality of the said election special can partly be blamed for the program's format- squeezing four presidential aspirants into one program. Of course, Atty. Trixie cited additional factors that disappointed a lot of netizens of how the ""Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews"" panned out by coming up with 'jolog' and stale questions, no educational aspect and lastly, did not add new information about the candidate. Here are some of the comments of netizens below. Boy Abunda's interview was much better and was done professionally and the responses from BBM was very impressive and convincing. Questions asked was well researched and not like Jessica Soho's interview was like a game show for kindergarten. Soho's interview was the talk of the town because it was rejected by BBM. Napahiya si Jessica Soho and GMA. BBM have learned his lesson to PICK HIS OWN BATTLE! Pathetic naman ng claim nyong yan GMA Network! Wala ng puwang yng mga pabebe questions nyong yan! Goodness! It only goes to show how the big networks think of their audiences...shallow. Sigh! I believe of what professor CLARITA CARLOS SAID, that it was a waste of time watching the Sojo interview it was like a high school slam book... but the best interview was by MR BOY abunda. Hype: 1. (noun) extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion. 2. (verb) promote or publicize (a product or idea) intensively, often exaggerating its importance or benefits. Parang naipakita ng mga sumunod na interview na medyo mababaw, medyo ma-showbiz lang ang pinangangalandakang interview ni Ms. Soho. Marahil dahil ito sa format nya na siniksik ang apat na kandidato sa isang programa. Pero damay na rin ang medyo baduy na mga tanong. Wala masyadong bago. Walang impormasyon na nauwi sa audience. Walang educational aspect at ni hindi nadagdagan ang kaalaman natin tunkol sa kandidato. So kahit ano pang sigaw ni Ms. Soho na magaling ang programa nya... We know better. ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of Isko Moreno's confession during the Jessica Soho Presidential Interviews that he kept the unspent P50M campaign donations, retired Air Force General Romeo Poquiz offered a brilliant and practical advice to Isko's fellow presidential candidates in a Facebook post. [Link here] The retired General suggested that like what Isko did in 2016, the presidential aspirants who are lagging behind the surveys better go home, chill and keep the campaign donations to themselves because even if they join forces, they have little chances of pulling an upset win over BBM. Should they heed his advice, they'd become instant millionaires. Besides, there is no prize for second placer in the election, Poquiz wrote. Poquiz ended the brief FB post by asking in jest for ""balato"" or a small portion of their prize winnings este money from campaign donations. To which the General's FB followers agreed. I fully agree with your suggestion Gen Poquiz.It's unfortunate that it's happening, only in the Pilipins. Basta BBM SARA ALL THE WAY 100. Sila ang tanging pagasa ng Inang Bayan. ❤ Tumpak sir... bakit pa sila mag effort? dapat hayahay nalang, dahil may kita narin naman sila, wala narin namang pagasang manalo, nagpainterview nga sila kay Jessica Sohol, kinaumagahan mas pinagusapan pa si BBM. Kaya nga karamihan dyan alam naman nila na hindi sila mananalo pero tatakbo pa rin para ma ka parte din sa campaign funds ng party nila. And we are talking in millions. You may now read Romeo Poquiz's FB post below. Ayan, kinonfirm mismo ni Isko na ang pagkakandidato ay paraan din lang para yumaman. Sabi niya kumita siya ng 50 milyon noong 2016 election dahil sa hindi daw niya ginastos lahat sa senatorial campaign niya ang ang mga donations sa kampanya niya. Kaya siya biglang yaman. Kaya ang suggestion ko sa mga kandidatong nagpainterbyu sa GMA-7, maging wais na tulad ni Isko. Wala na rin lang pag asang manalo maski magsama sama pa kayo, uwi na lang sa bahay, magpalamig la-mig, at itago na lang ninyo ang mga campaign donations na bigay sa inyo. O, biglang yaman, di ba? Tutal wala namang premyo sa second place sa election, di ba uli? Balato naman di-yan, ha? Tagay pa, pre! ",1
Pinoy Trending News,"In the Boy Abunda interview, the last question thrown at BBM has earned him even more the admiration of his supporters, one of them was the admin of the FB page AllWrite who gushed at BBM's answer, calling it gold. If you've already watched the Boy Abunda interview of BBM, I assumed you knew what was the question. In case you have yet to watch the interview because you were busy with more pressing tasks to do, Abunda asked BBM why Leni Robredo does not deserve the votes of Filipinos? As expected, BBM stuck to his message of not throwing stone to every dog that barks because you will not reach your destination and replied that he does not engage in negative campaigning. AllWrite called BBM's answer gold, especially coming from someone whose family has been maligned by their enemies for the last 35 years in local and international media. AllWrite remarked that BBM's answer to a very critical question reinforced his belief BBM has plenty to offer the country in terms of the economy, industry, and even in our personal lives. But what gave me goosebumps was the line AllWrite said to conclude his FB post and that is, one can be a lawyer, an economist, or a PhD holder, but one cannot really buy class and good behavior. Netizens agree with AllWrite's observation as shown in some of the comments below. It was the best answer coming from a badly maligned and misjudged presidential candidate. BBM has remarkable character and deep wisdom. That made the whole interview for me. Priceless! Same here...that's my favorite part in the interview. Disenteng pagsagot. Ayaw makasakit ng damdamin ng iba. Kita mo talaga sa kanya ang paggalang sa kapuwa. On how he expound on each question is admirable and awesome on how he explain to solve such issue Kaya siya ang iboboto ko. You may now read AllWrite's original FB post below. One of the most critical questions Tonight with Boy Abunda has posed to Bongbong Marcos is, ""Bakit hindi dapat iboto si VP Leni Robredo?"" BBM replied, ""...I don't believe and I don't engage in NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING."" This answer is gold, especially since it comes from someone whose family has been painted evil by enemies, castigated for 35 years, and has been the target of hatred from everyone around them, including local and international media. This was supposed to be an opportunity for BBM to explain why Leni Robredo does not deserve to be elected, particularly given her lack of leadership experience and expertise, but BBM did not resort to gutter politics. This is admirable, and I hope others will follow suit. This is one of the reasons I will vote for BBM; not because I am blind or a loyalist, but because I believe he has much to offer the country in terms of the economy, industry, and even in our personal lives. You can be a lawyer, an economist, or a PhD holder, but you cannot really buy class and good behavior. #GoBBM #BBMSARA2022 #BBMIsMyPresident2022 #BBMFORPRESIDENT2022 You may watch the Boy Abunda interview of BBM here.

Pinoy Trending News,"Did you know that in 2016, then Congresswoman and now Vice President Leni Robredo opposed the re- opening of the Mamasapano case because it was almost election and she feared it might be used by politicians for their re-election bids to score pogi points? Six years later, it seems someone is hell bent in making Leni Robredo pay for making her stance against the re-opening of the Mamasapano probe in public. In a Facebook post, Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu is making a strong case why the Vice President cannot be Commander in Chief for what she said in 2016 when there was a clamor to re-open the Mamasapano probe and hold the people responsible for SAF44 deaths accountable. Today is the anniversary of the Mamasapano clash and Chu took the opportunity to remind the public that until now, the fallen SAF 44 has yet to get the justice they deserve for dying because of what she called bad decision and botched government response. Chu said that if you look for the stories, Robredo justified her stance not to reopen the probe because it was almost election and might be used by politicians with vested interest. Chu urged netizens to take stock of Robredo's frame of mind which is to prioritize the elections and their reputation over real justice. WHY LENI ROBREDO CANNOT BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF Today is the anniversary of the MAMASAPANO clash. In the heat of the elections we almost forgot how 44 brave SAF died even when they didn't need to because of bad decisions and BOTCHED government response. Until now Wala pa rin justice for the SAF44. I would also like to remind you that Presidential aspirant Leni Robredo, when she was a Congresswoman, opposed the reopening of the investigation. Verbatim: ""Ako kasi wala akong nakikitang dahilan para buksan ulit. Unang una marami na tayong panahon na ginugol sa pag-iimbestiga, so ang tanong ko ano ang dahilan para buksan ulit iyong imbestigasyon?"" said the Camarines Sur representative in an interview. If you look for the stories, she said AYAW DAW NYA I REOPEN KASI MAG E ELECTION NA MAGAGAMIT LANG DAW. See how she prioritized the elections and their reputation over real justice? This goes to show how Leni decides, not for justice for heroes and their families, but for protection of her party. Leni is obviously selective about issues that matter, a character trait that defines most of the Liberal Party of which she is the leader, despite trying hard to disassociate with them by running Independent. Peel back the layers of Pink and Leni Robredo is as grotesquely Yellow as they all are the party that made the PH a nightmare for the poor and the powerless. Leni is Yellow YELLOW YELLOW and may we never forget that. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WHY SHE CANNOT BE OUR COUNTRY'S COMMANDER IN CHIEF. ",1

Social media influencer and microblogger MJ Quiambao Reyes, a staunch Duterte supporter but a self- confessed average supporter of BBM can't resist the urge to debunk Pernia in a Facebook post. Reyes asked her follower what do Duterte and BBM have in common? ""TROLL FARMS"" said the losers. Reyes slammed critics for turning a blind eye on the hundreds of thousands of warm bodies physically attending their rallies and joining caravans to explain their high ratings in the survey and quick to attribute instead their popularity to troll farms. Reyes asked netizens what these losers have in common? She refused to articulate her answer for fear of you already know what! Reyes ended the brief FB post by clarifying that she is not a big fan of the Marcoses but neither blind to see the organic support he is currently getting. As of this writing, Reyes FB post has generated 4,398 reactions, 205 comments and 265 shares in just 5 hours and growing. You may now read Reyes' original FB post below. WHAT DO DUTERTE & BBM HAVE IN COMMON? ""TROLL FARMS"" according to losers. Who cares about the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos (not Indians, Vietnamese, or Arabs) PHYSICALLY attending their rallies & joining the caravans? Basta, ""troll farms yan sila"". *** Q: What do these losers have in common? [Kayo na nga ang sumagot at baka pag initan na naman ako ni Mang EpBi. *** Note: I may not be a big fan of the Marcoses but I am neither blind (so as not to see the kind of organic support he is currently getting) nor am I stupid to tag his passionate supporters as trolls.

Pinoy Trending News,"In the wake of Leni Robredo's dismal performance in the Jessica Soho interview, retired broadcaster Jay Sonza can't help but draw a parallel of Leni to his student whom he described as kinda slow in class but the similarities appears to end here. Sonza confided that he used to teach high school and college and recalled giving 63% grade twice to a student because he was not only slow but lazy in class. That student though managed to catch up and turned his fortune around in the end. Sonza asked the netizen's opinion what do they think of Leni who was slow in class, does she still have a bright future? Sonza urged netizens to look at Robredo's scorecard in the segment where Jessica Soho showed Leni Robredo, just like her fellow presidential aspirants, a pic and asked to describe in one word. But lo and behold, Leni scored zero for not following the instruction. Here are some of the reactions of netizens as shown in the comments below. A student who is a good listener could transform themselves into what the teacher would want them to be and attain success. Those who lack comprehension and are unable to follow instruction lands into trouble and, when combined with a stubborn attitude, equates to self-destruction. Ang sabi kasi DESCRIBE IN ONE WORD. Simpleng instruction, tanga parin. Sakto nga na tawag sa kanya ""MaDUMB"" TANGA e. Pag TANGA ung sinosupportahan mong maging presidente, ano tawag syo? Nagpatunay lang na di lahat ng nakatapos matatalino.... board passer pa yan ahhhh! Corruption in university is real. Ano kaya masasabi ng mga naging guro nito ng elementary kung may nabubuhay pa. Shout out Jessica Soho sana next segment nyo kausapin lahat ng mga naging guro ng mga Kandidato na pinag debate mo. Malamang taas rating. Manunuod kaming mga solid BBM. Ito ung estudyante na malakas sa teacher dahil rich kid at malaki mag donate ang parents pag may solicitation program ang school, minsan first honor pa kahit Ala talagang laman ang brain Nagtataka ako ngayon paano to naging abogada at may doctorate pang pinagmamalaki yong mga pinklawan. You may now read Sonza's original FB post below. Back in the '70s, noong nagtuturo pa ako sa highschool at college, 2x akong nakapagbigay ng first grading grade na 63% sa estudyante ko dahil nuknukan ng tamad at medyo slow talaga sa klase. eventually, nakahabol naman. Pero kung ganito naman ang mag-aaral mo, bagamat hindi naman ako judgemental na tao, ano sa tingin mo? May pag-asa pa ba ang kinabukasan nito? Tingnan mo naman, zero. As in, walang nasagot na tama.

Pinoy Trending News,"Jessica Soho of GMA News is a multi-awarded journalist and winner of the prestigious Peabody Award twice for her documentaries on social relevant issues. In 1991, Soho was the first Filipino to win bronze medal in the esteemed New York Film Festival for her coverage of the Cagayan Valley hostage crisis. In other words, Soho isn't your run-of-the-mill journalist and TV show host but touted as one of the most trusted among the news people in the country. But that does not mean Soho is infallible and cannot make mistakes. Soho's handling of the presidential interview, particularly how she handled Leni Robredo in the interview recently forced some netizens to question if indeed Soho deserves our trust to help the nation decide who to vote for as the country's next leader by asking the hard and serious questions to the presidential applicants but when it was Leni Robredo's turn, Soho asked the type of questions we often hear on pageants to select Miss Gay in our barangays? Let us reflect for a moment and decide whether Soho is fit to interview, in our behalf, the country's presidential applicants? Meanwhile, if you ask international relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot, Soho deserves the public's trust to handle the job interview for the presidential applicants. albeit in a sarcastic tone. Ms Jessica, thank you for this very difficult question for Leni. Sasot's followers erupted in laughter as shown by the number of netizens who hit the laugh emoji button on Sasot's FB thread. In fact, out the 9,700+ reactors, 8,500 netizens were laughing with Sasot. The netizens' comments were even depressing on Soho's part to even care to read it. In fairness to Ms Jessica Soho. The question she gave to Mrs Robredo was just fitting to an extra oridanary house wife not for a candidate for President, just for a house wife. And mind you some love her to be the next President of RP not Cam Sur. award winning journalist yarn?! It shows that her show was unpolitically suitable. Its just like having a Quiz Bee or X-Factor, not to mentioned her voice. She should focus on her Ka Puso and refrain from politics.. Politic is something to take seriously not just another noon show... Imagine nyo, sana si Vic Sotto at Joey De Leon ang nagtanong nyan kay Leni?#littlemissphilippines2022 Jessica Soho is just levelling the playing field. Questions are based on their IQ. That's fairness.** ",1

Pinoy Trending News,"If Leni Robredo did more than just assess and help re-energized Cebu island before Christmas and New Year, she would have convinced this Marcos supporter to vote for her and ditched Marcos. Well, that is the claim of a Cebuano named JR Santillan in a FB post. Santillan confessed he is set to vote for BBM but was ready to ditch him had Leni Robredo brought back power to the Island of Cebu before Christmas and New Year. However, Robredo appeared to have lost the opportunity to convert one vote into her favor because did little and did not even made a follow through, according to the Cebuano netizen. Not only that, Santillan found it even more frustrating that Robredo's camp spins in a way that she is doing more than her rivals, even the administration in terms of helping the Cebuanos. Santillan remarked that he could have received some of Robredo's relief goods if indeed she has done a lot for Cebu but even one grain of rice did not reach his hand. Santillan took a swipe at Robredo whom he said can spend millions in ads but had no money for relief goods and have to rely for donations to give to the typhoon victims. You may now read JR Santillan's original FB post below. Nag assessment siya dito sa Cebu after Odette then nag FB live but wala siya follow through... if she brought power back to the entire island before xmas and new year i would have ditched BBM. Addendum: i know its campaigning but what frustrates me is that her team spins it in a way that she is doing more than anyone else even the administration. If she doing a lot sana i could have received some of her relief from donations eh ni isang butil ng bigas wala! She could spend millions in ads but for relief nang lilimos pa! i was open minded and was willing to be swayed to possibly vote her but i guess she is a lost cause and now determined to go early to the polls and not vote for her.

Pinoy Trending News,"A very brief open letter cautioning Leni Robredo about people donating to her Presidential campaign if she does not want to end up like ER Ejercito makes the round on Facebook. The author is none other than agp or Atty. Ahmed Paglinawan of the FB page Luminous. Atty. Ahmed said that if Leni Robredo does not want to follow the footsteps of ER Ejercito, she should be strict in monitoring volunteers donating to her campaign. Besides, Atty. Ahmed said there is nothing surprising peoople donating to Robredo because will donate to politicians during election as their way of helping. However, if they really want surprises, even now, Atty. Ahmed wants to thank Leni Robredo for her ignorance. Netizens jumped into the comment section to specifically react how the billboard donor describes Robredo and Pangilinan as candidates.

Baka eto dapat anjan - takot palagi! tanga palagi! t@ng ina palagi! 3% May Tapang 3% May Talino at3% May Tiwala Very generous na yan Some netizens doubted the claim of the Robredo camp they have many volunteers because if indeed they have many volunteers, one netizen wondered why they could hardly collect donations from their donation drive. Some said the Robredo camp are even behind such stunt. Yung sila sila nag gagaguhan. Dami daw volunteers eh di nga sila makalikom ng simpleng donation drive. grupo din nila yan kunwari lang di nila alam at nagulat sila imposible na yong nagdonate di nila ipapaalam eh kaya nga minamanok nila para kung sakali manalo makakasipsip sila! nagulat lagi nalang kayong maang-maangan hahaha Alam naman ni lugaw Yan.

Natural na may magdo-donate sa isang politiko bilang ayuda sa eleksyon. Pero kung ayaw mong matulad kay ER Ejercito, dapat strikto ka sa pagsubaybay sa mga ganyan. Pero kung gulat talaga ang gusto mong reaksyon, ngayon pa lang.... Maraming salamat sa iyo, Leni Robredo. #AngSayaLangNamin ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"No one messes with a Nobel Laureate, not even ex-Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo. In a petition filed yesterday before a Manila Regional Trial Court, convicted criminal Maria Ressa asked that a “Cease and Desist” order be issued against Robredo. Of late, Robredo has been making the rounds of public fora here and abroad, talking about disinformation in the Philippines — a battle cry that Ressa has been espousing for many years. “It hurts Ressa’s ego that a defeated presidential candidate would suddenly take up an advocacy that has won her the Nobel Peace Prize,” a source close to the Rappler CEO told The Adobo Chronicles. In her petition, Ressa said that Robredo does not have the proper credentials to be talking about disinformation. No response from the Robredo camp as of press time.  ",1

Just like her citizenship status, information on the Nobel Laureate’s age has been hard to come buy, fueling a lot of speculation especially on social media. Finally, the convicted criminal-CEO of Rappler, the least-trusted news brand in the Philippines, gave the clearest clue on how old she is — on national television! During a live television interview on CBS, Ressa told one of the hosts that she has been talking about truth since 1927, “long before the age of exponential lies and long before the age of social media.” 1927 — that’s less than a decade since World War II ended! Which means she must have been at least 25 years old when she talked about truth in 1927. Ergo, Ressa must now be 121 years old, more than two decades older than former Philippine Senator Juan Ponce Enrile. Here’s Ressa talking about her age:  ",1

But alas, the night turned from magical to embarrassing for the CEO of Philippine blogsite Rappler. During her introduction, Streep said that Ressa could stay in the U.S. and seek asylum to avoid the conviction and court cases she is facing in the Philippines. Reacting to Streep’s statement, Ressa said she felt insulted when the actress insinuated she was not an American citizen. (Ressa has dual citizenship — American and Filipino). “Streep displayed the arrogance of many Americans who stereotype people of color (read: non-whites) as perpetual foreigners and invaders of the Great White Way,” Ressa told The Adobo Chronicles. We tried to reach Streep for comment on Ressa’s accusation but were told by her secretary that she was busy filming her 75th movie of her lifetime.

This, after the Securities and Exchange Commission affirmed its previous ruling revoking Rappler’s media license for violating the law on media ownership. As of this writing, however, Filipinos contend that Ressa has run out of courts to make her case to.  If anybody has any knowledge as to which other judicial body Ressa could submit her appeal to, kindly anonymously forward the information to The Adobo Chronicles.

Ressa assumes her position at noon, tomorrow, June 30, as Secretary of the Department of Appeals (DA). Among her latest appeals is that of her conviction for cyber libel, arising from a chase filed against her and another Rappler employee by a private individual. Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has affirmed its earlier ruling revoking Rappler’s media license which all but made Ressa ex-CEO.

After the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revoked its media license and stood by the decision after the Court of Appeals junked Rappler’s petition challenging the SEC ruling, the online new source has been reduced to a blog. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. A new NGO has been formed whose members are vloggers and social media influencers. Rappler has joined as a proud member of the United Vloggers and Influencers of the Philippines (UVIP), in the hope that PCOO will consider accrediting vloggers as members of the Malacañang Press Corps. PCOO rules require SEC registration for news media to be accredited to cover Malacañang press briefings, which practically disqualifies Rappler.

But alas, Leni Robredo declined the invitation to attend Sara Duterte’s inauguration in Davao City today, citing a previous commitment in Naga City, But a mole in the Office of the Vice President told The Adobo Chronicles that the real reason Robredo declined the invitation was because it would be too embarrassing for her to be seated next to President-elect Bongbong Marcos who defeated her in the elections by a huge margin. During the campaign, Robredo boasted that she had defeated Marcos several times in the past (2016 VP elections and the electoral protest) and that there would be no reason she would not defeat him again in the race for president.

The convicted Rappler CEO who worked her way up to the Nobel Peace Prize through lies and disinformation, told The Adobo Chronicles that she was shutting down her online news business and investing instead in securities.

It is a legacy that could define, or redefine the country’s standing with the world community. Tagged by many as a departure from the Philippines’ long-standing attachment to Uncle Sam, Duterte opened the door for harmonious and beneficial relationships with its Asian neighbors and world powers that matter. Today, the Philippines has earned multiple distinctions as a province of China, a Federated State of Russia and Prefecture of Japan. Six years may be too short for a good President.

According the survey, TikTok now accounts for 15% of Filipinos who look to social media as their source of news. Further, GMA is now the largest news creator on TikTok.

It will be recalled that as Comelec Commissioner, she voted to DQ (disqualify) then presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos from running in the 2022 elections. She was eventually overruled by the Comelec Division handling Marcos’ DQ case. Now, it’s Guanzon’s turn to be DQ’d.

Adobo Chronicles,"Move over, SWS, Pulse Asia, Publicus Asia, Octa Research. Your surveys now have to take the back seat! Enter, mock elections at a garment factory showing Vice President Leni Robredo leading at 77% of the votes, indicating a clear, landslide win over her closest rival former Senator Bongbong Marcos. This is the first time ever that Robredo has overtaken Marcos in polls and surveys since the start of the 2022 elections campaign period. Champagne flowed at the Office of the Vice President’s residence and office at the Boracay Mansion in Quezon City. The Adobo Chronicles reached out to the UniTeam campaign for comment. Spokesperson Atty. Vic Rodriguez said their camp is not worried, adding that ”mock elections beget mock results.” Reacting to Atty. Rodriguez’ s comment, actress and TV host Kim Chiu said, ”Why is it that the spokesperson is always the one making public comments, instead of candidate Bongbong Marcos himself ?”  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"It’s just four days before the May 9 Philippine elections and the candidates are in high campaign gear for the remainder of the campaign period. Here’s the latest from the Leni Robredo-Kiko Pangilinan camp: -As if conceding the race to Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte, campaign manager Bambam Aquino urged their supporters to stand firmly behind the unity message of the UniTeam. A graceful exit, so to speak. -Bam Aquino urged ex-Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon to desist from campaigning for Robredo, saying that the former’s recent posts and photos on her social media account is destroying the ”disente” image of the campaign and the pinklawan. -Anticipating a devastating loss in the May 9 elections, the pinklawan camp has already come up again with a design for their new color — black, to represent mourning. Kakampink Angel Locsin was seen modeling the new t-shirt design.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Forget about the Igkesia Ni Cristo (INC) official endorsement of Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte. Endorsements for the Leni Robredo-Kiko Pangilinan tandem have started to pour in as the May 9 Philippine elections draw near. Following the endorsement from 1,400 Catholic bishops and priests, Robredo and Pangilinan have also been officially endorsed by: -1,700 altar boys from across the country -14 nuns from St. Scholastica’s College -12 Catholic statues from different churches in the National Capital Region -The National Alliance of Kindergarten Students (NAKS). -The Bicol Association of Nursery Students ( BANS) More game-changing endorsements are expected in tbd last few days of the campaign period.

Adobo Chronicles,"The political opposition’s cancel culture is like an infection that goes viral. Not even Rappler, the least-trusted news brand in the Philippines whose CEO Maria Ressa is a convicted criminal has been spared. Just a day after the Igkesia Ni Cristo (INC) endorsed the candidacies of Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte, Rappler cancelled the vote-rich religious denomination by publishing a mudslinging report digging into the past. Would Rappler have published the report had INC endorsed Leni Robredo instead? Is this a case of sour-graping by this left-leaning, propagandist purveyor of fake news?  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The daughters of Vice President Leni Robredo will do anything to help their mom become the next President of the Philippines. The Vice Presidential daughters — who are all girls — have barnstormed every corner of the 1,700-island Philippine archipelago in pursuit the elusive votes. In Baguio City, Jillian Robredo shopped for fresh strawberries at the Public Market while engaging in small talk for vendors and customers alike. Now, Tricia Robredo was seen wading in well-landscaped fish pond in Bukidnon for a much-need photo opportunity under the guise of reaching out to the Lumads in isolated communities. You have to give it to the girls. They’d walk a mile for their nanay.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Thanks to the hot mike, Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo has finally conceded the race for the election of the Philippines’ top executive to former Senator Bongbong Marcos. On the 13th day before the May 9, 2022 elections, Robredo admitted to her own campaign staff that :”hindi natin kakayanin” (We won’t make it.) Since Day 1 of the presidential campaign, Robredo has not led any of the polls which consistently showed Marcos as the top choice for president by a wide margin.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"It was the same concert rally, reported by two news sources both known to be sympathetic to the Leni Robredo-Kiko Pangilinan campaign. But their crowd estimates varied significantly. The Inquirer estimated the crowd that attended the event in Pampanga at 100,000, but Rappler, the least-trusted news brand whose CEO is a convicted criminal, had more than double that number, reporting a crowd of 220,000!  The Adobo Chronicles reached out to the Leni-Kiko campaign and asked them how they come up with crowd estimates at their rallies. A spokesperson for the campaign said, they go for the highest bidder. Now you know.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"With just about a month before election day, Vice President Leni Robredo and Senator Kiko Pangilinan were burned today in Cebu City! Well, not them personally, but their giant tarpaulins put up on the facade of a building along Legaspi Street which caught fire Friday morning. This development sent jitters to the Leni-Kiko campaign and their followers, adding unnecessary stress and frustration following poll after poll showing Robredo is far behind frontrunner Bongbong Marcos in the presidential race. A bad omen?  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Running out of viable options, the camp of Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo is radically changing its campaign strategy. Led by Robredo’s daughter Tricia, the camp is now going house to house trying to convince Filipinos to vote for her mother. In the Filipino language, it is known as ”bahay-bahayan.” Bahay-bahayan is when children at play pretend to be mother, father and kids and do chores or activities to mimic real family living. A total make-believe. Just like Robredo’s quest for the presidency.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"It is one of the credentials she has been brandishing, but now, Ex-Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon may have to strike it out from her curriculum vitae. Today, Guanzon’s alma mater, Harvard University officially declared her ” alumna non grata,” the academic equivalent of persona non grata. The decision of the university’s board of regents was a result of recent activities and public appearances of Guanzon which all but denigrate the highest standards and reputation held by Harvard. Since her retirement from Comelec, Guanzon has been using her Twitter account to spread inanities, making many question her psychological state of mind. She has also been appearing at campaign rallies of Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo, screaming non-sensical memes and slogans mostly directed at former Senator Bongbong Marcos. In response to a query from The Adobo Chronicles, a university spokesperson said Guanzon’s name has been deleted from Harvard’s roster of alumni. He also said Guanzon’s tirades against Marcos goes against the university’s motto of ”Veritas,” meaning ”Truth.”  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"No one thought of taking photos or videos — perhaps because of shock — but supporters of Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo reported witnessing not just one, but two miracles during the latter’s grand rally in Antipolo City yesterday. According to online testimonies, it was raining very hard all day at the rally, drenching many of the attendees and fanatics. Then, all of a sudden, when Robredo took to the microphone to speak, the rain abruptly stopped, they said. But there was another miracle reported by a young girl who was standing about 10 yards from the stage. ”Pagkatapos magsalita ni Leni, lumutang siya” she claimed. (After Leni spoke, she floated) Robredo is known in campaign circles and on social media as ”lutang.” A floater.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"A volunteer of the Leni Robredo-Kiko Pangilinan campaign team was charged with trespassing during a house to house sortie in Barangay Kalabasa in Quezon City. Campaign volunteers usually knock on doors or ring the door bell to ask permission to enter private property and perform their campaign mission. Alas, a pink-clad volunteer braved a steep climb to a house, courageously navigating its wooden, makeshift ladder. There was no door to knock on or door bell to ring. When she finally reached the top of the ladder, not only did she find out that the household members living there were solid BBM (Bongbong Marcos) supporters — she was also charged with trespassing before the office of the Barangay Tanod. Nevertheless, the volunteer received a commendation from the Office of the Vice President.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Vice President Leni Robredo, if elected president on May 9, 2022, will push for Good Manners and Right Conduct ( GMRC) among member-states of ASEAN as a way to solve the conflict with China over disputed territory. Robredo was responding to a question during last night’s Comelec-sponsored presidential debate. The question was: how will you convince ASEAN nations to unite to stop China’s militarization in the West Philippine Sea? She maintained that it was innate for some nations to refuse to have good conduct.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo lashed out at the United States for what she described as meddling in the Philippines’ domestic affairs. Robredo was reacting to a statement by former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich saying that she may be dumbest person ever to become Vice President.  Calls to Gingrich for a reaction remained unanswered as of press time.  ,1
Adobo Chronicles,"Senator Kiko Pangilinan has urged Vice President Leni Robredo to increase the per rally participant fee she is paying from P500 to P1,000, if she wants to gain more votes and endorsements. In a statement on his social media account, Pangilinan said that he is willing to decrease his fee so that Robredo could increase hers. This will ensure more participants in the VP’s concert/rallies and, hopefully more votes for her presidential bid. ”I am willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in favor of Robredo,” Pangilinan told The Adobo Chronicles.

Adobo Chronicles,"For the first time since 2022 Presidential Election polls began late last year, Vice President Leni Robredo has taken the lead over 4 of her closest rivals, including former Senator Bongbong Marcos. In a newly-released survey commissioned by The Adobo Chronicles, Robredo was No. 1 at 51%, followed by Senator Ping Lacson at 23%. Manny Pacquiao came in 3rd with 15%, followed by Manila Mayor Isko Moreno with 9%. Marcos came in last at 2%. Champagne flowed at the Office of the Vice President headquarters in Quezon City, in an apparent euphoria over this development that shocked many in the political arena, including those in the opposition themselves. The survey, with a sample size of 3,000 asked just one question of the respondents: “If the election were held today, which of the presidential candidates are you most likely not going to vote for?” The survey has a margin of error of +/-2%.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The latest Laylo survey on the presidential race just released now shows that former Senator Bongbong Marcos and Vice President Leni Robredo are in a virtual tie! Both candidates are statistically tied at 61%! Well, it depends on how one looks at the survey results. By turning the chart at 180 degrees.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Many are eagerly awaiting the formal endorsement of Bongbong Marcos’ presidential bid from President Rodrigo Duterte. While the Administration’s party, the PDP-Laban, has already signed a resolution endorsing Marcos, there seems to be an eerie silence from the President himself. Sources close to The Adobo Chronicles seem to hold the answer to this mystery. They said that Duterte will make the formal endorsement when he celebrates his 77th birthday on March 28. The reason? Duterte is a big fan of palindromes. He also considers them ”lucky.” A palindrome is a word, a phrase, or a sequence of numbers that reads the same whether you read it forward or backward. So endorsing Marcos, who is No. 7 on the ballot, on his 77th birthday creates the palindrome ”777.” “It is a triple lucky 7 palindrome and it’s easy for voters to remember,” our sources added.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo has responded to criticism that she has again changed color. The VP has been accused of abandoning yellow for pink to distance herself from the loser Aquinos and their cronies. During a televised presidential forum sponsored by the waning Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), Robredo was seen wearing a peach-colored dress, prompting netizens to speculate that she was again trying to reinvent herself and her politics. Robredo spokesperson Barry Gutierrez, in a message to The Adobo Chronicles, categorically denied all speculation. “The dress worn by the Vice President was originally pink. Unfortunately, her kasambahay (domestic help) accidentally washed the dress using bleach that wasn’t color safe,” he said. “We were running late for the televised forum so Robredo didn’t have time to change to another (pink) wardrobe,” Gutierrez added.

Adobo Chronicles,"Former Senator Bongbong Marcos has been registering a significant lead for the presidential race among all scientific polling agencies. It has not come as a surprise that the son of the late great president also leads in street surveys and in the 7-Eleven Speak Cup poll. But a new poll now shows that Vice President Leni Robredo has finally overtaken Marcos. As reported by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Robredo’s traction is coming from anecdotal evidence, popularly known in the Philippines as ”Marites” and ”tsismis” (gossip).  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The camp of Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo may have pink-colored drone shots and aerial photos of their concerts to show for huge crowds, but nothing beats the telescopic photo of the recent BBM-Sara UniTeam grand rally in Cavite. This photo was beamed to earth by the International Space Station showing the huge crowd that attended the UniTeam’s rally in General Trias City in the vote-rich province of Cavite. It is the penultimate crowd shot never before seen anywhere in the world!  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The separation of church and state is a principle adhered to universally, but the Roman Catholic Church has its limits when it comes to politics and Mary the mother of Jesus Christ. Pope Francis today approved the excommunication of a group of supporters of Philippine Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo. The Pinklawans as they are popularly called, were photographed holding a poster bearing the image of Robredo as Mother Mary. Not only that, the poster made a mockery of one of the most sacred prayers of the Catholic Church, the ” Hail Mary.” In his excommunication order, the Pope accused the group of sacrilege and idolatry and said that the action of The Vatican was irreversible. The Adobo Chronicles tried to reach Robredo but her spokesperson said she was taking a nap after working continuously for 18 hours.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The Leni Robredo camp was so confident that their claim of 130,000 attendees at their most recent concert rally would be unbeatable. But they learned to never say never. Vote-rich Cavite province delivered for the BBM-Sara UniTeam. And the Caviteños delivered well. As aerial photos and videos of the UniTeam grand rally in General Trias City went viral on the Internet, netizens thought they were seeing images from the 2016 miting de avance of President Rodrigo Duterte. But the photos were authentic, non-Photoshopped images from the UniTeam rally. No balloons, no paper flowers, no confetti, no oversized headdresses. Just people, real people. The Adobo Chronicles ventured to estimate the crowd at one million, subject of course to honest-to-goodness fact checking by Rappler, VeraFiles, Inquirer, ANC, FactCheckPH, and News 5. Regardless, pinklawans were one in deciding to cancel Cavite — at least in their advantage column. Oh, this cancel culture. Sometimes it works well!  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Netizens couldn’t believe it when they saw photos of ABS-CBN anchor Karen Davila aboard Bongbong Marcos’ caravan truck. Was it a work of Photoshop? Davila would be the last person netizens think would be joining Marcos in one of his sorties. But lo and behold, Davila herself confirmed that she did officially join the UniTeam and that the photo was authentic. On her Twitter account, Davila admitted trailing Marcos, as she did with Manny Pacquiao.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"The terno is to Imelda Romualdez Marcos, and the yellow knee-length dress is to Cory Aquino. What would Leni Robredo wear as an occupant of Malacañang? In a hastily-called press conference on Monday, Robredo unveiled what she said would be the new national dress of the Filipina if she is elected the 17th president of the Philippines. It is no different from the loose, three-quarter sleeved, no-collar blouse that she has been wearing in public events since she gained weight. She’d usually wear the dress in pink or violet. The VP has been trying to distance herself from Cory’s and PNoy’s yellow color in the hope that voters will see her as a reinvented opposition figure to the Marcos and Duterte regimes. The Office of the Vice President has officially notified the Miss Universe Philippines and Binibining Pilipinas franchise holders of her plan to issue a new executive order on her first day as president, replacing the terno as the official national dress of the Philippines. If elected president, the country will see Philippine representatives to Miss Universe and other international pageants wearing this new dress as part of the national costume competitions. The Adobo Chronicles tried to get a comment from the National Association of Fashion Designers, but our calls remained unanswered as of press time.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"While nine presidential candidates were exchanging and copying each other’s arguments in the first debate sponsored by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) at a plush hotel venue in Pasay City, former Senator Bongbong Marcos was being cheered by tens of thousands of supporters at a grand rally in Marikina City. Soon after, The Adobo Chronicles conducted a unique, anonymous survey among likely voters using photos of the nine debate participants. We say ”anonymous” because we asked respondents to arrange the bottom images of the candidates according to how they would rank them as their choice for president. This was how the respondents lined up and ranked their favored candidates — from left to right.  It was obvious that the least favored candidate was Leni Robredo, but it could not be determined how each of the remaining male candidates were ranked by the respondents. Since Marcos skipped the debate, we asked respondents for a thumbs up or down response to his Marikina grand rally. The result? Marcos increased his numbers from 65 to 80%, with less than 50 days remaining in the campaign.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"It’s not final until it’s final. Presidential aspirant Bongbong Marcos may still participate in the Commission on Elections (Comelec) debates if one of his conditions is met. The Marcos campaign earlier said that the former senator had decided to skip the debates. The Adobo Chronicles asked Marcos spokesperson Atty. Vic Rodriguez what would change Marcos’ decision. Rodriguez said that a representative of Comelec, preferably spokesperson James Jimenez, should join the presidential candidates on stage so that they (and the panelists) could ask questions on very serious issues hounding the poll body. Following the brouhaha surrounding ex- Commissioner Rowena Guanzon, Comelec has been the target of intense criticism about entering into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Rappler, the least- trusted news brand whose CEO Maria Ressa is a convicted criminal and is accused of alleged tax evasion. Comelec has also been criticized for lack of transparency in the printing of ballots for the May 9, 2022 Philippine elections. As if those were not enough, a Senate hearing headed by Senator Imee Marcos concluded that Smartmatic, a contractor of Comelec, has been hit with a serious security breach. Comelec has admitted to said breach.  The Comelec debates could yet make it to the Guinness Book of World Records as the debates of the century, featuring not only 100% of the presidential candidates plus the poll body itself.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"In anticipation of the unprecedented landslide victory of Bongbong Marcos, son of the late greatest Philippine president, in the May 9 Philippine presidential elections, 20th Century Fox released a teaser video which will be a major highlight of his inauguration as the 17th President of the Republic of the Philippines. The Adobo Chronicles was honored with the exclusive media release of the teaser video. Fox also hinted at producing a full-length film on Bongbong Marcos, initially titled, ”Return of the Tiger,” in time for the Christmas holiday.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Director Darryl Yap’s ” The Exorcism of Len-Len Rose” was a parody of what many believe to be real-life events involving Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo. Sometimes parody imitates life, then sometimes life imitates parody. The latter happened recently when Yap’s fiction came to life. The Adobo Chronicles just obtained a leaked copy of a photo of a real-life exorcism of Robredo. The photo shows the Vice President being exorcised by the Catholic clergy. Notable in the photo was the fact that the bishop and priests performing the ritual were all wearing pink masks — the color of the Robredo campaign. It is a well-established fact that members of the clergy wear pink only on two occasions during the liturgical year: once in Advent and the other during Lent. Could it be that in the exorcism, the devil in Robredo possessed the clergy instead?  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Ex-Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon today announced she is one of the invited panelists in the forthcoming presidential debates sponsored by the poll body. Guanzon made the official announcement on her Twitter account. The Adobo Chronicles fact-checked the authenticity of her public statement and found it to be true, except that it was just a figment of her imagination, brought about perhaps by drinking too much Coke.

Adobo Chronicles,"Former Senator and presidential aspirant Bongbong Marcos again has a commanding lead in the latest Pulse Asia poll, garnering a 60% of the votes of respondents compared to Vice President Leni Robredo’s 15% distant second. But it is entirely a different story with the 7-Eleven cup poll, where customers pick the cup of their preferred presidential candidate for their soda or coffee purchases. In the 7-ELEVEN poll, Marcos was at the very bottom of the pack. Senators Ping Lacson and Manny Pacquio are neck and neck for first place.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo is proving to the country that there is no such thing as ”solid north” when it comes to her arch rival, former Senator Bongbong Marcos. In a pink rally held today in the municipality of Alcala, Cagayan province, the Robredo campaign told The Adobo Chronicles that 100,000 people were in attendance. This is by far the largest crowd that has ever attended a Robredo rally, eclipsing the 70,000 that the campaign said attended the rally in Bacolod City. Alcala is a municipality with a population of 41,000, according to the latest census. Congratulations to the Robredo campaign!  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Be careful what you do on stage during a campaign rally. The cameras are watching! Megastar Sharon Cuneta, wife of vice presidential candidate Kiko Pangilinan learned her lesson last night, and she learned it well. While Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo was delivering her scripted campaign speech at a rally in Bacolod City, Cuneta was seen offering Rolex watches for sale! Cuneta is known for boasting about her Rolex watch collection in previous posts on her social media account. Earlier during the rally, Cuneta took to the microphone and laughed about the NPA, Abu Sayyaf and terrorists. The Adobo Chronicles asked both Robredo and Pangilinan for their comment. They simply ignored our query.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Among the many campaign promises of Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo, this truly stands out: the Philippines will be the first and only country in the world with zero defecation. Zero defecation has always been a passion for Robredo, as seen in this clip from one of her weekly radio programs. A Robredo presidency will put the country on the world map, and the Guinness Book of World Records not just for zero defecation but the most number of bloated citizens!  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Queen of all media Kris Aquino announced on her social media account that she and her family will be leaving soon. Aquino admitted that she has been saying this forever but this time, it’s for real. ”Arrangements have been made” she added. Meanwhile, Leni Robredo and her three daughters who are all girls told reporters they, too, are leaving soon.  Robredo’s statement fueled speculation that her family is making plans to return to their native Naga City, knowing that she is about to lose in the May 9, 2022 presidential elections. Or, it could just be that they are leaving the Boracay Mansion in Quezon City (official resident of the Vice President) in June when Robredo’s term is up.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Filipinos will probably never understand why Esquire Philippines chose Maria Ressa as its ”sexiest woman alive” in 2010. Neither will they figure out why the magazine has chosen Commission on Elections (Comelec) Spokesperson James Jimenez as the magazine’s very first ”sexiest man alive.” Is it the greying beard and mustache? Is it his glasses that frame his moon-like face? Is it the eye contact he maintains when responding to media questions? Well, who knows? But Jimenez is definitely the man of the hour in this very contentious election period when the nation picks its 17th president come May 9, 2022. It all started late last year when Jimenez called The Adobo Chronicles ”fake news” when we published a satirical article in which we said that then Commissioner Rowena Guanzon wanted to scrap the 2022 elections. Jimenez also made a controversial decision to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with Rappler to deal with disinformation and voter engagement in connection with the elections (Comelec just suspended the MOA after Solicitor General Jose Calida asked the Supreme Court to nullify the partnership.) The Comelec Spox is also in trouble after he ordered the taking down of ”illegal” tarpaulins and posters of political candidates, mostly from the camp of Leni Robredo. The Supreme Court has issued a Temporary Restraining Order against Comelec. As if these were not enough, Jimenez announced yet another questionable partnership with Vote Pilipinas for the conduct of the Comelec’s 2022 presidential and vice presidential debates. He warned that candidates who will not participate in the debates will be barred from using the poll body’s e-rally platform. Jimenez has also recently denied reports that Comelec’s database has been hacked, after an investigative report was published by The Manila Bulletin. Perhaps it is Jimenez’ handling of these controversies that Esquire found sexy, and which could eventually make the spokesperson the last man standing in these elections.   ",1
Adobo Chronicles,Leni Robredo has earned the reputation as the ”Fake VP.” Will she now be known as the ”Fictitious President?” This developed as more fictitious characters are coming out publicly in support of Robredo’s candidacy for president. The latest fictitious character to endorse her is actress Jane de Leon who is most known for her role as the fictitious ”Darna.”  ,1
Adobo Chronicles,"In a yet-to-be-released poll by Pools Asia, Senator Manny Pacquiao has overtaken Vice President Leni Robredo in voter preference if the presidential elections were held today. While former Senator Bongbong Marcos maintains his commanding lead at 65% of poll votes, Pacquiao now is at No. 2 with 12% of the votes, compared to Robredo’s 10%. Poll respondents were asked to state the reason for their preference. All those who picked Pacquiao were unanimous in saying that the champion boxer-turned senator was more generous than the VP. Pacquiao has been giving out P1,000 to potential voters, while Robredo has reportedly paid just P500 to each of those who attended her Cavite political rally last Friday, according to a Cavite solon.

Adobo Chronicles,"The city government of General Trias in Cavite province has levied a P10 Million fine on the Leni Robredo campaign to pay for the cleanup of last week’s rally. The crowd which the campaign claims to have reached 47,000 left piles and piles of trash and pink confetti, not to mention blown-up pink balloons which many say were meant to project the appearance of a large attendance at the rally. General Trias city hall officials decried the irresponsibility of the campaign and attendees in leaving litter and toxic materials after the rally ended. The P10 Million includes environmental charges resulting from blown-up pieces of pink balloons used at the political event. The officials say what transpired is in direct contrast to Robredo’s campaign promise to protect the environment and reduce pollution in urban cities and other areas in the country.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,Commission on Elections (Comelec) Spokesperson James Jimenez told The Adobo Chronicles today that the recently-announced Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) the poll body inked with Rappler was a classic case of a typo. Jimenez was referring to a partnership between Comelec and Rappler under which the latter would help in voter engagement and fighting disinformation in connection with the May 9 Philippine national elections. Many were very critical of the partnership because Rappler is known for its bias against the Duterte government as well as Bongbong Marcos who is running for President. No less than Solicitor General Jose Calida said that the government intends to file a case against Comelec unless the MOA is rescinded by March 4. Jimenez said that Comelec erred in that it falsely identified its partner as Rappler when it should have been Russia. This news report from the Philippine Star explains it all.  ,1

Yet retired Commission on Elections (Comelec) Commissioner Rowena Guanzon is all but promoting a mockery of handicapped people. In a post on her Twitter account, Guanzon is asking her followers to post selfies mimicking facial paralysis (“ngiwi” in Tagalog) and to use the hasghtags #ngiwisquad and #ngiwichallenge.  THE FACTS: Many people suffer from facial paralysis, a disability. Such paralysis could be caused by stroke, Bell’s palsy, trauma, tumors, viruses and Lyme Disease. Is Guanzon going to publicly apologize to the very people she’s advocating for?  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"It seems that Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo just made a big fuss over standing in heels for three hours during the debate sponsored by CNN Philippines. Robredo was seen leaving the University of Santo Tomas debate venue, going barefoot and carrying her high-heeled shoes. Her campaign wanted to get the people’s sympathy for the ordeal she went through just to show up at the forum attended by all presidential candidates except Bongbong Marcos. But a leaked photo of Robredo during one of several commercial breaks showed her sitting comfortably in a chair provided by CNN, wearing flipflops —truly a rare footage that wasn’t seen by the television audience!

Adobo Chronicles,"CLAIM: Vice President and presidential aspirant Leni Robredo has been claiming that her office has consistently received the Commission on Audit ‘s (COA) ”highest audit rating.” FACT: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS “HIGHEST COA AUDIT RATING.” An agency being audited can only get an auditor’s unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion. Even an unqualified opinion often comes with auditor’s notes and recommendations to correct deficiencies or errors.  As a matter of fact, in 2019, COA flagged the Office of the Vice President regarding its Angat Buhay program for poor planning and lack of documents:  OUR CONCLUSION: Robredo’s repeated claim is FALSE!

Adobo Chronicles,"If you can’t lick him, join him! Supporters of presidential aspirant Leni Robredo have all but given up on their candidate whose poll ratings continue to trail frontrunner Bongbong Marcos by a wide margin. In desperation, Leni supporters joined the camp of Marcos, all in the spirit of unity which has always been the former senator’s campaign promise and strategy. In one of Marcos’ motorcade, pinklawans, as Leni supporters are called, showered Marcos with confetti consisting of Leni-Kiko fliers. What great use for what would otherwise be just ineffective, wasted Leni campaign material.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"Just hours after the Commission on Elections (Comelec) announced that it had inked a partnership with blog Rappler for a voter engagement and to fight disinformation related to the May 9 elections, Filipino netizens are crying ”foul!” Unnamed sources have told The Adobo Chronicles that a group representing netizens is set to file a petition before the Comelec to DQ (Disqualify) Rappler.  The sources said that it was wrong, or even unconstitutional for the poll body, which should be non-partisan, to enter into any kind of agreement with the least-trusted news brand in the Philippines whose CEO Maria Ressa is a convicted criminal. ”It’s like rewarding Rappler for its bias, anti-administration and anti-Marcos stance, not to mention its violation of the law,” they said. Many are questioning whether this partnership is really about voter intimidation, instead of voter engagement. This is a developing story.  ",1
Adobo Chronicles,"When presidential aspirant Bongbong Marcos skipped the Jessica Soho presidential interviews, critics labeled him a ”coward.” The former senator was similarly criticized when he skipped the interviews sponsored by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP). Marcos’ reason for his absence in the latter was that he had a prior commitment which it turned out to be an interview with Korina Sanchez, a known opposition sympathizer. Now, Vice President Leni Robredo has announced that she is skipping the presidential debate sponsored by SMNI Network, citing previous commitment.  Social media immediately reacted to Robredo’s announcement with hashtags of #LeniDuwag and #NasaanAngPangalawangPangulo, similar hashtags that greeted Marcos’ skipping of the Soho and KBP interviews.

It was revealed that the reason Marcos declined to participate in today’s Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)’s presidential candidate forum was because he had to fulfill a previous commitment to appear in Sanchez’s show.

The interviews, aired on GMA network, featured four presidential aspirants — Ping Lacson, Isko Moreno, Pacquiao and Robredo. A quick survey conducted by The Adobo Chronicles showed that supporters of Robredo believed everything that their idol says — and said during the interviews — including her statement that if she weren’t running for the presidency, she would vote for Pacquiao.

It will be recalled that Robredo has been criticized and made the laughing stock of netizens after recent statements and hiccups including that in which she said she was given IV, not through her veins but her ”good nerve.” She was also quoted reportedly saying that Filipinos should pray for our (health) frontlines because they are the ones who are in the frontlines. Robredo claims the videos showing her hiccups were spliced.
